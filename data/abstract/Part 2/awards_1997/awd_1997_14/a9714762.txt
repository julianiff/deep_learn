Abstract    :
              Abstract  ATM-9714762  Robinson, David A.  Rutgers University    Title: Eastern
              United States Climate and Atlantic Sea Surface  Temperature    This proposal is
              for a comprehensive  investigation, for all four  seasons, of linkages between
              the western North Atlantic Sea Surface  Temperature (SSTAs) and regional scale
              climate anomalies in the  eastern United States.  The proposal aims at
              identifying and  diagnosing, by a combination of methods, anomalies of
              temperature,  precipitation, and snowfall associated with certain SSTA
              patterns.   Results of the proposed research will lead to better understanding 
              and prediction of the climate of the densely populated eastern  seaboard.`
