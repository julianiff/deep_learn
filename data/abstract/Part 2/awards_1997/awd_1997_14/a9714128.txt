Abstract    :
              9714128  Joshi  A detailed systematic effort is conducted to develop cost 
              effective technology for remotely queried sensor units in a  composite
              structure.  Current ongoing research generally  targets monitoring of a
              specific subsystem in the  laboratory, during testing and development, using
              wired  sensors.  Existing efforts on wireless smart materials are  in the
              beginning stages and focus on the development of  simple feasibility test
              articles. In the current project,  embedded wireless sensory arrays for
              providing structural  health and usage information about composite materials
              are  being developed.  The investigation leads to the development  of
              inexpensive sensors, techniques for rapid insertion  during composite
              fabrication, and methods of easily  combining panels of smart material into a
              complete system.  Specific topics being addressed include: (1) sensor 
              identification techniques, (2) transmitter/receiver circuit  development, (3)
              energy coupling (between an outside  interrogator and sensors) through a lossy
              composite  material, (4) sensor placement or insertion, (5)  comparability
              between transducer and interconnection  materials with the composite material,
              (6) calibration and  compensation of transducers, (7) development of outside 
              interrogator, and (8) selection of optimal sensor  placements.  ***
