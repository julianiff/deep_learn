Abstract    :
              Abstract    Geer ATM-9714415    The American Meteorological Society (AMS), in
              cooperation with the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
              proposes  another offering of an intensive summer workshop for master 
              Precollege teachers of atmospheric science topics to be held at the  National
              Weather Service Training Center (NWSTC) in Kansas City,  Missouri.  The
              purposes of the program are to:  (a) provide renewal  and updating learning
              experiences that focus on dramatic advances  in observing, analyzing, and
              forecasting weather, (b) explore and  suggest ways in which the products of
              these technologies and  techniques can be employed in school studies of the
              atmospheric  environment, and (c) prepare workshop attendees to conduct
              training  sessions on selected atmospheric science topics for teachers in 
              their home areas during the next school year.
