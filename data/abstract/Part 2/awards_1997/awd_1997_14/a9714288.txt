              characterization since 1980 of several dozen species  of hyperthermophilic    
              microorganisms are largely responsible for the tremendous current  interest in
              life in extreme     environments on Earth as well as on other planetary bodies
              in our solar  system. Most known     hyperthermophiles were cultured from rock
              and water samples collected  at deep submarine     hydrothermal vents or
              terrestrial hot springs. Although much has been  learned about microbial    
              physiologies, phylogenetic diversity, and novel metabolic pathways from  this
              relatively sparse set     of organisms, the true extremes of genetic diversity
              and metabolic  strategies on Earth and     elsewhere are impossible to predict
              a priori. This concept is  underscored by the widely accepted     notion that
              less than 0.1 percent of all extant microbial species are  currently known.
              Knowledge of     microbial species thriving in extreme environments can be
              expanded  through the application of     innovative methods to isolate and
              culture novel species of  extremophiles. Like all living     organisms,
              hyperthermophiles are intimately associated with their host  environment.
              Therefore, a     detailed understanding of the geochemistry of hydrothermal
              environments  is likely to place     constraints on essential substrates for
              life. To reach this overall  goal, this project will     combine thermodynamic
              calculations to determine potential energy  sources with detailed chemical    
              analyses of hydrothermal fluids to design new media for growing a wide  variety
              of  hyperthermophiles.     The readily accessible and chemically diverse hot
              springs in the  Aeolian Islands, Italy, including     those on Vulcano, are
              ideal sampling sites for this highly  interdisciplinary study.
