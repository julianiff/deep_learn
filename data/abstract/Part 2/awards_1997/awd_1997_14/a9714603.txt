Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:  CTS-9714603  Principal Investigator:  Rempfer   
              This is a proposal to hold a workshop on POD-Galerkin models for the
              description of the dynamics of complex flows.  The Workshop will be held at
              October 13 and 14, 1997 at  Cornell University.  About two dozen of the leading
              scientists doing research in this area will participate.  The objective is to
              determine the state-of-the-art in this field.  Topics will include the issues
              involved in construction of POD models, the accuracy of low dimensional models
              and their possible application such as control of turbulent flows.
