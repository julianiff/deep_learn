Abstract    :
              9714104  Grossman    This award supports a four-day workshop entitled
              "Mathematical Techniques to Mine Massive Data Sets".  The goal of the workshop
              is to introduce a group of mathematical scientists to techniques used for the
              mining of massive data sets.  Data mining is the automatic extraction and
              discovery of  patterns, associations, changes, anomalies, and significant
              structures in large data sets.  Large data sets generated by scientific,
              engineering, medical and business applications are becoming increasingly
              common.  Developing algorithms which can uncover patterns in large data sets is
              an important mathematical challenge.    In the past decade, extremely large
              sets of data have been generated at an alarming from very diverse areas
              including scientific, medical, communications, and manufacturing.  These data
              bases are growing much faster than the speed of computers and thus are
              outstripping our ability to extract information  with current techniques.  The
              aim of this workshop is to acquaint mathematical scientists with the issues
              involved in the mining of massive data sets and to use their ability of
              abstraction to obtain new approaches to this critical problem.
