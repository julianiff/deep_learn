Abstract    :
              ***  9714049  Sirkis       A structurally embedded fiber optic transducer of 1
              cm  gage length will be developed, capable of simultaneously  measuring the (1)
              temperature, (2)normal strain parallel to  the optical fiber axis, (3)
              secondary principal strains  in  the plane perpendicular to the optical fiber
              axis, and (4)  orientation of the secondary principal plane, inside a 
              structural composite material. Successful development of the  proposed fiber
              optic sensor technology will provide  experimentalists with a capability that
              is simply  unavailable today - the ability to measure key components of  the
              strain state inside structural materials.       This  proposed transducer is
              based on cascading (1) an  in-line fiber etalon (ILFE) sensor, (2) a saturated
              Bragg  grating written into a standard low birefringent (LoBi)  optical fiber,
              and (3) a normal (unsaturated) Bragg grating  written into an elliptical clad,
              stress-induced high  birefringent (1-liBi) optical fiber. The 11,FE sensor has 
              very small intrinsic temperature sensitivity, and is  sensitive to only the
              axial strain component in the host  structure. As a result, the ILFE component
              of the proposed  sensor leads to one of the five requisite independent  optical
              measurements required to solve for the five sought  after Thermo-mechanical
              field variables (three normal  strains, temperature, and secondary principal
              direction).  The saturated Bragg grating written in the LoBi-Fiber  produces
              two reflected Bragg wavelengths, thereby yielding  two more independent optical
              measurements. Finally, the  Bragg grating written into the elliptical clad HiBi
              optical  fiber takes advantage of residual birefringence coupled with  this
              fiber's anisotropic mechanical response to yield the  final requisite two
              independent optical measurements. The  multiaxial thermo-mechanical strain
              sensor will be  demodulated using a hybrid coherence division/wavelength 
              division multiplexing technique coupled with scanning,  dithered Fabry-Perot
              filter Bragg grating dem odulation and  path-matched differential
              interferometry with pseudo  heterodyne ILFE demodulation. The thermo-mechanical
              strains  will be deduced from the resulting optical measurements  through the
              use of composites micromechanics models based on  concentric cylinders modeling
              techniques and nested multiple  inclusions models, The sensor system will be
              evaluated  through tests of progressively increasing complexity,  starting with
              uniaxial tension of an unembedded sensor and  ending with the combination of
              temperature and transverse  compression applied to AS4/3501-6 graphite/epoxy
              laminates  with embedded sensors.       The  potential uses of the proposed
              sensor assembly  include: (1) material measurements to aid constitutive model 
              development; (2) field measurements to verify micromechanics  models; (3)
              real-time in-situ health monitoring; (4) process  monitoring; and (5) residual
              stress  measurements. This  sensor can provide information to engineers and
              scientists  that is Simply unavailable today, thus enabling the  realization of
              more cost-effective, safe and highperformance  systems.***
