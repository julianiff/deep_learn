Abstract    :
                Unique to mammals and elaborated in Primates (most notably humans), neocortex
              is the predominant brain locus for sensory data processing, conscious motor
              control, cognition and volitional communication. Its basic constituent is the
              cortical column. Classical studies reported the number of neurons in a cortical
              column (`radial neuron number`) to be remarkably constant across most species
              and neocortical regions, with Primate primary visual cortex containing double
              the number of radial neurons found elsewhere. However, recent evidence suggests
              reduction in radial neuron number in marine mammals, as well as variation in
              radial neuron number in different cortical areas of monkeys, cats, and rats.
              This investigation aims (1) to provide `unbiased stereological` measurements of
              radial neuron number, neuron size, and cortical thickness across a diverse
              sample (15 orders) of mammals, (2) to assess contributions of phylogeny,
              ecology, and life history to the observed variation, and (3) to quantify
              primary-visual and primary-motor cortex in Primates so as to compare radial
              neuron number across species with that in different regions of the same brains.
               Neocortical development is directly observable only in species lacking the
              variance in radial neuron number characteristic of mammals as a class. Broader
              data on radial neuron number will thus provide a more naturalistic context for
              interpreting normal developmental and pathological events in `laboratory
              models,` with mechanisms implicated in neurological health and disease
              presumably recruited during brain evolution to achieve specific adaptive ends.
