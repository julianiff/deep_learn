Abstract    :
              9714807  9714807  Jakus    The PIs, Karl Jakus of University of Massachusetts,
              and Yet-  Ming Chiang of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,  propose a
              2 day workshop involving 40 people to identify and  prioritize research needs
              and opportunities in ceramics for the  coming decade.  The workshop will
              consider issues related to  both structural and functional ceramics, focusing
              on  fundamental rather than "mission-oriented" research.  The broad  goal of
              the workshop will be to identify those areas of  ceramics research in which new
              or continued emphasis by NSF is  likely to lead to breakthroughs in scientific
              understanding,  discovery of new ceramics and materials systems, and./or 
              development of new technologies that can ultimately have a  broad economic
              impact upon the nation.  %%%  The proposed workshop is in response to the COV
              recommendation  (April 1996) that each program hold a workshop assessing the 
              role of the program in its research area.  The 2 day workshop  will identify
              and prioritize research needs and opportunities  in ceramics for the coming
              decade.  ***
