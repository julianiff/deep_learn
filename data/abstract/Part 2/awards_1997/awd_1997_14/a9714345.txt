                Abstract    Proposal Number:  CTS-9714345  Principal Investigator:  Milgram   
              This project is aimed at developing methods to digitize 2D holograms (pieces of
              exposed and developed photographic film) and reconstruction of the 3D optical
              fields by digital computation.  This has the potential to make analysis of data
              on holograms not only faster, but better controlled since each step in the
              computational processing is precise. The usual method of obtaining quantitative
              data in the form of a computer file from a hologram is to reconstruct the
              optical field in a laboratory and scan that field in three dimensions with a
              tracking video camera having microscope optics.  This is an extremely tedious
              process in as much as the hologram must be illuminated with a special laser
              system to reconstruct the optical field encrypted on the hologram and the
              amount of 3D data which then has to be scanned is usually enormous.    Although
              the detailed project work is on development of computer algorithms and on
              digitizing holograms, the motivation comes from applications in fluid mechanics
              and in marine biology.  For example,  three dimensional particle image velocity
              achieved by making a double or triple exposure hologram of particles in a
              volume (HPIV) is a brand new and developing method.  In addition, a potentially
              revolutionary extension of the project is direct digital recording of
              measurement holograms with the extended resolution laboratory scale video
              cameras of the near future.
