Abstract    :
              9714055  Girvin  With a wide ranging title, this is a multi-project grant to 
              consider a large variety of current problems in condensed  matter theory. The
              group which these PI have assembled at  the Indiana University, is generally
              acknowledged as a  leader in numerous forefront problems.  This renewal grant 
              contains projects on phase transitions in Josephson junction  arrays,  on an
              analysis of possible numerical methods  incorporating both the density matrix
              renormalization group  and also the dynamic mean field theory, possibility of a
               skyrmion lattice phase transition, quantum phase transitions  at very low
              temperatures, superfluid 4He in confined  geometries where it is believed to be
              a prototype for the  complex interplay between strong correlation and disorder,
               quantum Hall edge states and  ultra-small superconducting  grains.  %%%  This
              grant continues to support the cutting-edge work of  these two senior PI's. 
              They are acknowledged as amongst the  world's best in innovative research,
              effective nurturing of  younger students and colleagues and community service, 
              including the recent panels at NRC and at NSF.  Their  research program spans a
              broad spectrum of topics including  electron gas (and superconductivity) at
              high magnetic  fields, attempts to improve numerical techniques and 
              superconductivity in ultra-small particles.  ***
