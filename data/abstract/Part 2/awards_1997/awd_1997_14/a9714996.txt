Abstract    :
              The reaction between atomic hydrogen and ozone in the upper mesosphere produces
              vibrationally excited hydroxyl, resulting in two important consequences. 
              First, excited hydroxyl radiative decay produces the hydroxyl nighttime airglow
              layer, used extensively in proving the hydroxyl chemical production rate and in
              studying wave phenomena.  Second, the collisional relaxation of highly excited
              hydroxyl is key to nocturnal heating in the upper mesosphere.  Mesospheric
              energy budget models rely on accurate understanding of hydroxyl product
              distribution and its collisional and radiative decay.  Despite the importance
              of this process, a significant fraction of the reaction exothermicity is not
              accounted for in existing measurements.  Thus, the investigator is conducting
              an in-depth study of the atomic hydrogen and ozone reaction, where all possible
              hydroxyl nascent product state populations are detected and quantified.  His
              measurements are reducing the uncertainly in necessary input parameters to
              mesospheric energy budget models.
