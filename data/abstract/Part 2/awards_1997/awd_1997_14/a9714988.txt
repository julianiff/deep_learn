Abstract    :
              9714988  Cooper  This is an award to support exploratory research on the
              potential  use of ionizing radiation produced by a beam of energized  electrons
              from an electron accelerator to control and possibly  eliminate production of
              nuisance odors from conduct of sludge  management processes at wastewater
              treatment plants.  The  investigator will conduct the research using an
              electron beam  research unit at the Miami Wastewater Treatment Plant on
              Virginia  Key.  The exploratory work will involve subjecting water  solutions
              of several of classes of chemical compounds identified  as responsible for
              nuisance odors produced during treatment of  sludges to radiation produced by a
              1.5 Million Electron Volt  accelerator.  Compounds to be investigated include
              organic and  inorganic sulfides, mercaptans and terpenes.    The proposal
              leading to this award was submitted and under  Special Guidelines for Small
              Grants for Exploratory Research  (SGER) in NSF 95-27, Grant Proposal Guide. 
              This research was  suggested at the Key West workshop in February of 1997
              conducted  under NSF 95-25059 that addressed potential additional uses of 
              ionizing radiation produced by a beam of energized electrons as a  step toward
              full utilization of this environmental technology in  treatment of wastewater
              and process residues.  This project also  relates to research under NSF Award
              No. 95-08728 on physical and  chemical factors that influence production and
              emission of  gaseous air pollutants from wastewater treatment processing of 
              treatment-derived sludges  ***
