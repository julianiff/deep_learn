              Abstract  ATM-9714910  Gray, William M.  Colorado State University  Title:
              Climate Analysis and Extreme Range Seasonal Prediction    This research is for
              further development and application of a range  of extended climate forecasting
              schemes.  These schemes include 1)  seasonal hurricane activity in the Atlantic
              and East Pacific  basins, extending to specific groupings of hurricanes by
              origin and  movement, 2) seasonal rainfall in West Africa, tropical areas of 
              the Atlantic, Americas and East Pacific and 3) ENSO variability.   Along with
              the basic science concerning underlying physical  mechanisms, this work seeks
              greater forecast accuracy at 9 to 14  month lead times.  This research into
              long range climate  prediction, if successful, will have significant societal
              impacts  in mitigating the effects of seasonal and interannual climate 
              variability.
