Abstract    :
              The post-doc supported in this grant is testing the
              thermosphere/ionosphere/electro-dynamic general circulation model's sensitivity
              to upper boundary conditions.  Using the field-aligned interhemispheric plasma
              model, he is specifying electron temperature, ion temperature, and oxygen ion
              at the model's upper boundary as a function of season and solar activity.  Both
              of these models are compared with incoherent scatter radar data from Arecibo
              and Millstone Hill Observatories to evaluate the capabilities at low and middle
              latitudes.  The post-doc will then make any further refinements.  This
              delineation of the model sensitivity to external forces and boundary conditions
              is needed for future studies of the causes of variability in the atmosphere.
