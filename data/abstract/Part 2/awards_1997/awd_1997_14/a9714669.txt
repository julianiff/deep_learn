Abstract    :
              Seven portable magnetometers, used for CEDAR investigations of electrodynamics
              in the low-latitude ionosphere, are performing experiments with chained or
              clustered sensors.  Investigators hope to gain knowledge of large day-to-day
              variability found in equatorial electrojet, Sq current system, Appleton
              ionization anomaly, and equatorial spread F.  Previously hampered in
              investigations of low-latitude electrodynamics, researchers are filling the
              lower-altitude data gap by combining ground-based sensors, including an
              ionosonde, a backscatter radar, and a chain of magnetometers.  The
              magnetometers estimate the overhead current as a function of magnetic dip
              latitude.  Then, these estimates convert to those of drift velocity,
              latitudinal variation in drift velocity converts into electric-field variation
              with altitude over the dip equator, and the magnetometer measurements provide
              time-continuous data along a magnetic meridian with spatial coverage in both
              hemispheres.  Beyond these studies, the magnetometers will also be deployed
              under other CEDAR and Space Weather projects.
