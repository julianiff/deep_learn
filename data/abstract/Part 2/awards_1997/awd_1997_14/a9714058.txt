Abstract    :
                The Romberg Tiburon Center for Environmental Studies is a  marine laboratory
              operated by San Francisco State University  (SFSU), a predominantly
              undergraduate institution (M.A.)  highest degree awarded) with a 57% minority
              enrollment.  The  Romberg Tiburon Center (RTC) is the only academic research 
              facility on San Francisco Bay, one of the largest estuaries  in the US It is
              primarily a graduate facility with a tightly  focused research mission aimed
              toward gaining fundamental  understanding of the physical and bilogical
              processes of San  Francisco Bay and its surrounding environments. Research 
              scientists at RTC have trained and supported over 45  students in the last five
              years and have extensive  collaborations with fellow university, and federal
              and local  environmental agency scientists.  RTC initiated in 1996 its annual
              Visiting Scientists  Program, which supports a visiting scientist at the 
              Center, and 2 other visiting scientists will be in  residence in 1997-1998 as
              well.  Fundamental aspect of  RTC's research and educational program involves
              the use  of the Research Vessel, the R/V Questuary.  This 38  foot vessel was
              acquired in 1991 and underwent major  renovations costing approximately $90,000
              in order to  be re-engined this year. Although the Questuary is now  a modern,
              sea worthy vessel, it is capable of limited  oceanographic sampling and
              database development due to  its out-of-date navigational and scientific
              sampling  equipment.  The primary objective of this project  is to upgrade the
              scientific capabilities of the  Center's primary research vessel by acquiring
              an  integrated instrument package to collect environmental  data with high
              spatial and temporal resolution and  state-of-the-art data acquisition and
              storage.
