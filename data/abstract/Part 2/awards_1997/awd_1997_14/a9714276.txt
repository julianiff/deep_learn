Abstract    :
              RAINEY  9714276    ABSTRACT      Hyper-arid deserts can be considered extreme
              environments with respect to their conditions of low humidity and low water
              activity.  Such natural environments on Earth represent the conditions closest,
              with respect to the degree of desiccation, to those reported in free space or
              on the Martian surface.  The Atacama Desert in Chile, with rainless regions and
              low humidity, is such a hyper-arid desert.  Microbiological studies of  arid
              environments have generally involved semi-arid to arid environments is
              available.    The primary objective of the proposed study is to investigate
              enrichment and isolation methodologies that will maximize recovery of the
              entire range of prokaryotic diversity within a given sample from this extreme
              environment.  This will be achieved by employing different isolation and
              enrichment techniques and monitoring the progress of these enrichments at the
              molecular level.  Both aerobic and strictly anaerobic communities will be
              targeted.  Various doses of ionizing and uv radiation will be applied as a
              selective enrichment strategy.    This study will provide bacterial stains that
              will represent the diversity in a hyper-arid environment and that can be used
              for further studies on the survival of microorganisms in similar extreme
              environments, including extraterrestrial environments.  These bacterial strains
              will constitute a resource of model microorganisms for future studies of the
              link between ionizing radiation resistance and desiccation resistance.
