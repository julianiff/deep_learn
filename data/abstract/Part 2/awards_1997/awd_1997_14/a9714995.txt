              ABSTRACT  ATM 9714995  Leaman, Kevin D.   University of Miami  TITLE: Analysis
              of Precipitation Variations at Periods of the Tropical Intraseasonal 
              Oscillation in the Isthmus of Panama.    This proposed work will explore the
              nature of intraseasonal fluctuations in precipitation over Panama by analyzing
              a data set of 30 years (1965-1994) of daily rainfall from Panama Canal
              Commission (PCC) with an extension back to 1905 from a subset of six stations. 
              The question of whether this oscillation is local or is related to global
              Tropical Intraseasonal Oscillation will be probed.  Relevant satellite data
              will also be analyzed.  The successful completion of this work will add new
              knowledge about the mechanisms responsible for intraseasonal variability of
              rainfall over Panama and at a minimum it will bring to public domain an
              important data set, the PCC precipitation data set.
