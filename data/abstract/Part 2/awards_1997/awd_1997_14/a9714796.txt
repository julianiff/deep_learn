Abstract    :
              The Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), now being operated by the New Jersey
              Institute of Technology, continues observations in solar physics.  The
              continuing activities focus on aspects of both high resolution observations and
              infrared observations.  Upgrades and installation of new instruments enable
              significant advances in understanding of the Sun's magnetic structures. 
              Investigators expect results to also broaden understanding of the fine
              structure of granules, pores and sunspots (and associated waves), the contrast
              of faculae and sunspots at various wavelengths, and the evolution of magnetic
              structures in flare producing regions.  Quantitative synoptic observations
              accurately monitor the rising phase of Cycle 23, providing tools for predicting
              flares and filament eruptions.  In all, the BBSO contributes to understanding
              flare mechanism, small-scale magneto-convection, and the three-dimensional
              structure of the solar atmosphere, all crucial causal factors in space weather.
