Abstract    :
              9714102  This project sponsors a Workshop on Higher-Order Operational 
              Techniques in Semantics (HOOTS II) held at Stanford during  December 8-12,
              1997. The workshop provides an opportunity  for researchers working on various
              techniques based on  operational semantics for reasoning about higher-order 
              programs to work together to gain an in-depth understanding  of the full
              spectrum of existing techniques, including those  outside their immediate area
              of expertise. The workshop  builds on the preliminary exchange of ideas
              promoted by  HOOTS I, which took place at the Isaac Newton Institute for 
              Mathematical Sciences in Cambridge, England, October 1995.  The structure is
              that of a working meeting rather than a  forum for presenting technical papers
              and includes a mix of  activities. The workshop will result in progress towards
              a  richer and more elegant framework for operational techniques  to a wider
              range of languages using combined expertise of  the participants in diverse
              areas of specialization.  ***
