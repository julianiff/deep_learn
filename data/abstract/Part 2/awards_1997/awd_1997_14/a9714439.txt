Abstract    :
              9714439  Gaffney  Characterizing the population structure of important 
              Antarctic species is essential to an improved understanding  of Antarctic
              ecology, and the successful management of this  ecosystem. The British
              Antarctic Survey (BAS) has initiated  a collaborative international effort
              (Project Gene Flow)  aimed at delineating population structure in several key 
              species (fish, squid and krill). A one-month cruise in the  Scotia Sea to
              obtain biological specimens and oceanographic  data is scheduled for November
              1977, and this represents a  unique opportunity to apply both established and
              novel  molecular techniques to an important problem in Antarctic  resource
              management.    Four commercially and/or ecologically important species will  be
              the primary targets of the research: mackerel icefish,  Patagonian Toothfish,
              Antarctic Krill and the Seven Star  Flying Squid. A variety of molecular
              genetic techniques,  including some that are well-established and others that
              are  novel but extremely promising, will be applied to delineate  genetic
              population structure in these species. This research  will provide information
              on the whether separate "stocks" or  genetically different populations of these
              species exist in  Antarctic waters. This information will be useful in the 
              management of these species.
