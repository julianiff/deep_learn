Abstract    :
              The MARGINS initiative seeks to understand the complex  interplay of processes
              that govern continental margin  evolution globally, particularly targeting
              multidisciplinary  research programs involving field experiments, numerical 
              simulations, and laboratory analyses.  Support is provided  for a coordinating
              office at the University of Hawaii for  the MARGINS initiative over the next
              two years to provide  the planning, organization, and communication necessary
              to  further develop MARGINS research efforts that include  focused studies in 4
              areas:  (1) Subduction/Mass Balance  Study; (2) SEIZE Experiments; (3) Rifting
              Focused Study; and  (4) Sediment Dynamics of Continental Margins.
