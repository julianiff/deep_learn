Abstract    :
              Jimmie Doll from Brown University and David Freeman from University of   Rhode
              Island are supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue their research on the   influence of
              adsorbate-adsorbate interactions on the dynamics of   interfacial hydrogen.  
              Doll and Freeman have developed a dynamical path   integral theory for
              adsorbate vibrational lineshapes and applied it to   studies of Hydrogen
              adsorbed on various metal surfaces such as Ni(111).    Results using the
              embedded atom model have been used to elucidate   experimental results obtained
              from vibrational spectroscopy.  The current   research program builds upon
              these results by  improving upon the   interaction potentials through the use
              of ab initio electronic structure   calculations.  The embedded cluster methods
              developed by Whitten and   coworkers at North Carolina State University  will
              be employed to develop   more realistic ab initio interaction potentials for
              use in the dynamical   path integral calculations.  Applications will include
              studies of   Hydrogen on Ni(111), Ni(110), Cu(110) and W(110) as well as  
              delocalization of hydrogen adsorption on Ni, Cu and W clusters.  The  
              calculations will be used to interpret experimental data obtained by   Peter
              Weber of Brown University.  Hydrogen storage in metals and hydrogen
              embrittlement are important   technological problems. The fundamental work of
              Doll and Freeman has a   very good probability of providing significant
              theoretical insights into   a molecular based understanding of these phenomena.
