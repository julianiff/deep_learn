Abstract    :
              The investigator is measuring vertical distribution of the Joule heating rate in
              the high latitude E region, and the influence of E-region neutral winds on this
              distribution.  He addresses neutral dynamics, electrodynamics, and energetics
              throughout the vertical column of polar E region and coupling aspects with the
              magnetosphere and lower atmosphere.  Other issues he is hurdling:  (1) to what
              degree the Lorentz force on neutral wind extends downward into the E region;
              (2) how the level of geomagnetic activity and its duration impacts the Joule
              heating rate, accounting for neutral winds; (3) what are load/generator
              characteristics of the high-latitude ionosphere and neutral winds' effect on
              them; and (4) the correlation of enhanced Joule heating rates with local ion
              temperature.  The physical coupling occurring in high-latitude E and interplay
              of tidal forcing from below, magnetospheric from above, have, until now, been
              poorly understood.  This study, highlighting the importance of the Joule
              heating rate as a primary high-latitude energy source, will change the tide
              significantly.
