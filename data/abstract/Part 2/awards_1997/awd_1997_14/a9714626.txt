Abstract    :
              Around 1980, V. D. Goppa used the theory of algebraic curves to construct a new
              family of codes, now referred to as algebraic geometric (AG) codes.  Code
              performance depended upon certain curve  parameters.   Shortly after, Tsfasman,
              Vladut and Zink showed the existence of curves such that the resulting AG codes
              had long lengths and performance exceeding that of the Gilbert-Varshamov (G-V)
              bound -- a feat that until then was widely considered unattainable.    
              However, the Tsfasman-Vladut-Zink result does not provide an explicit
              description of the curves.  Recently, Garcia and Stichtenoth exhibited two
              families of curves having an explicit and simple description, that also give
              rise to codes better than the G-V bound.   An explicit description of the AG
              code is still lacking however, as this requires the determination of a basis
              for a certain vector space, consisting of functions defined on the curve.      
               This remains an open problem and its solution using the theory of function
              fields is a principal goal of the research activity under this grant.   Recent
              progress in decoding AG codes has also increased interest in this problem.     
               Also under investigation are a second set of curves arising from the trace
              function over Galois rings and the intersection of hyperplanes in projective
              space.  The latter have application to the study of codes and pseudonoise
              sequences.
