Abstract    :
              With the discovery of turbo codes in 1993, near-capacity performance on the AWGN
              channel was realized for the first time since Shannon published his landmark
              paper in 1948.  It has recently been shown by the PI and others that turbo
              codes are a particular implementation of time-varying convolutional codes; 
              this differs significantly from the practice of the last 30 years, in which
              time-invariant convolutional codes have been emphasized.  The propose work is a
              preliminary study of methods for constructing classes of time-varying
              convolutional encoders and decoders.  In particular, the goal is to find or
              construct time-varying codes with a sparse distance spectrum and long block
              length, as opposed to the traditional goal of maximizing free distance.
