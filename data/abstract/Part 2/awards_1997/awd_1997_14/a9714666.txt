Abstract    :
              Investigators continue characterizing the composition and dynamics of the upper
              thermosphere, exosphere, and topside ionosphere at mid-latitude.  The
              methodology uses optical, infrared, and radar frequency remotes sensing
              techniques, in close association with radiative transport, photoelectron,
              neutral atmosphere, and ionospheric modeling.  In particular, they hope to
              improve understanding of ion-neutral coupling in the topside F-region. 
              Experimental and modeling efforts have led to new capabilities in measuring the
              concentrations of all major neutral and ion species in the topside ionosphere
              using the clustered instrumentation at the Arecibo Observatory.  This project
              brings the techniques together, producing a comprehensive description of the
              upper thermosphere and lower exosphere.  Scientifically, their focus is (1) the
              relation between hydrogen abundance in the topside ionosphere and increased
              methane in the troposphere, (2) the relation between hydrogen abundance and
              magnetic storms, (3) the effects of charge exchange on neutral hydrogen and
              oxygen abundances, and (4) the evaluation of new techniques to determine winds
              and temperatures in the topside ionosphere.  During six observational
              campaigns, investigators measurements are utilizing Fabry-Perot
              interferometers, photometers, all-sky imagers, and the incoherent scatter
              radars at Arecibo and Jicamarca.
