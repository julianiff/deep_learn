Abstract    :
              Vogelman  97-14268    The snow alga, Chlamvdomonas nivalis. grows on permanent
              snowfields and  is found in the alpine zone of the Rocky Mountairm, a habitat
              that  consists of some of the most extreme environmental conditions found on 
              Earth. In addition to surviving diurnal freezing temperatures, this  organism
              photosynthesizes under some clef the highest fluxes of visible  light and
              ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B; 280-320 run) found in a natural  environment.
              The proposed research will quantify microenvironmcnta1  extremes experienced by
              this nucroorganism and will provide baseline  information on its photosynthetic
              performance tinder such severe  conditions.      Using a variety of portable
              microscopic sensors and instruments,  simultaneous er~virontnental measurements
              of temperature, light, UV-B  radiation, COz concentrations add of
              photosynthetic performance will be  made across snow-deplh profiles containing
              C. nivalis populations.  Photosynthesis will be measured in 'vitro by oxygen
              evolution and under  conditions of variable light avid temperature.
              Corroborative  measurements of carbon fixation will be obtained by measuring 
              incorporation of i4C:O2 within snow cores. Effects of W-B on C. nivaIis 
              populations and photosynthetic performance verity be determined frown We 
              exclusion experiments conducted on the snowfields. These experiments  will
              establish a baseline for future studies of molecular mechanisms  that regulate
              adaptation and survival of this microorganism in this  extreme habitat.
