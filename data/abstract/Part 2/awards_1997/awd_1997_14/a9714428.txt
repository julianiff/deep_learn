Abstract    :
              9714428  Jaillet   This award is to support the Triennial Symposium on
              Transportation Analysis (TRISTAN).  The Symposium brings together leading
              researchers from around the world working on mathematical and algorithmic
              aspects of transportation systems analysis, with an emphasis on logistics,
              vehicle routing, common carrier operations, and traffic operations.     The
              Symposium serves as an important forum for the presentation and exchange of
              research ideas in transportation science, and is expected to spur the
              formulation of major research directions in the field.
