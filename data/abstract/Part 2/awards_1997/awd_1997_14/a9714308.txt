Abstract    :
                This proposal was submitted in response to the Environmental Geochemistry and
              Biogeochemistry (EGB) solicitation, NSF 06-152.  It is being jointly funded by
              the Divisions of Ocean Sciences and Chemistry.   The proposed research will
              improve our understanding of the speciation and trophic transfer of selenium in
              San Francisco Bay.  Estuaries such as this, are complex physical, chemical and
              biological environments that are not only geochemically crucial (e.g. elemental
              transfer from the trash water to the marine environment), but are also
              economically vital (e.g. fisheries, transportation).  The estuarine
              geochemistry of trace elements has been well studied, but the linkage between
              the chemical speciation of these trace elements and their cycling throughout
              the whole estuarine food web is largely unknown.  The combination of innovative
              field and lab studies proposed here will allow researchers to more accurately
              predict the impact of Se input and speciation on the entire trophic structure
              of these environments.  Moreover, the methods and approach used here for Se
              should be applicable to other trace elements and other estuarine environments.
