Abstract    :
              9714869  Narum    The F21, (Faculty for the 21st Century)  Network, at the
              Center of PKAL, (Project Kaleidoscope), fosters agents of change within the
              undergraduate science/mathematics community.  By enabling faculty at an early
              career stage to make connections with the present generation of leaders and
              engage in productive dialogue and meaningful activity directed toward
              transforming the undergraduate natural science community, PKAL will help build
              a foundation for the future of education and science in this country.  As the
              PKAL F21 Network grows, it is imperative to develop and expand opportunities
              for connections and professional growth available to F21 members.  Through a
              rigorous application process, the PI will identify approximately fifteen F21
              members each for a series of Summer Institutes during the next three years. 
              F21 participants will reflect the diversity in higher education in this
              country; they will also represent the various scientific disciplines.  Selected
              participants will spend five days with a small group of national leaders in
              education, public policy, and research who will serve as mentors to Institute
              participants.  The F21 Summer Institutes will offer a carefully-orchestrated
              and coordinated set of activities, providing:  opportunity for serious dialogue
              about the future of science and technology in a changing world and about the
              capacity of undergraduate SME&T programs-now and in the future-to serve the
              national purpose, time to reflect on personal and professional goals, templates
              for outlining an agenda for action in coming months and years that enables them
              to achieve their goals and support as they move toward implementing their
              agenda for action.  Assessment will be a key part of the PKAL F21 Summer
              Institute program.  The PI will seek to determine the increased leadership
              involvement at both the local and the national level in the continued effort to
              transform the learning environment for undergraduates in SME&T.
