Abstract    :
              9714161  Kastings    The project involves theoretical modeling of the effect of
              methane  and CO2 ice clouds on martian paleoclimate.  Early Mars appears to 
              have been warm and wet, yet existing climate models, which assume  a C02-H20
              atmosphere, have been unable to explain this.   Preliminary calculations show
              that the addition of ~1% CH4 to the  martian paleoatmosphere could have brought
              the mean global surface  temperature above the freezing point of water early in
              the planet's  history.  Most of the warming is caused by the absorption of 
              incoming solar radiation at visible and near-infrared wavelengths.   Methane
              has a complex band structure in this wavelength region that  needs to be
              accurately parameterized in order to do the climate  calculation properly.  C02
              ice clouds also need to be included in  the computer model to determine their
              effect on the planetary  radiation balance.  Calculations with an atmospheric
              photochemical  model suggest that a CH4 mixing ratio of 1% by volume could have
               been maintained if there was a source of methane at the martian  surface
              comparable in magnitude to the present biological flux of  methane on Earth. 
              Such a source could, in principle, have been  provided by methanogenic bacteria
              living on the surface of early  Mars or within basaltic rocks.  The recent
              identification of  possible fossilized bacteria in the martian meteorite
              ALH84001 is  entirely consistent with this scenario.  Finding a solution to the
               early Mars climate problem would help us to better understand Mars'  history
              and may have implications for the prevalence of life on  other planets both
              within and beyond our own Solar System.    This award is jointly supported by
