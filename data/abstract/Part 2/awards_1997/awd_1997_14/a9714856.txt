Abstract    :
                      9714856  Dong  This award is an activity under the US/PRC Earthquake
              Research  Protocol, Annex III.  Two research programs have been recently 
              conducted, one in the US and the other in the People's Republic  of China, on
              integrated earthquake hazard mitigation strategies  for metropolitan cities. 
              The programs produced two computer loss  estimation software systems, HAZUS97
              bu RMS, Inc., and P95-06 by  IEM of the State Seismological Bureau,
              respectively, which are  similar in scope but otherwise differ significantly in
              content.   This reflects the differences in natural and institutional focus.  
              This project will involve a joint effort to study the two  software systems to
              understand their similarities and  differences, with a view towards improving
              both.  In addition to  joint activities of exchange and cooperation, important
              tasks to  be performed include assessing the extension of HAZUS97 to other 
              countries with different seismic, geologic and building stock  conditions.  ***
