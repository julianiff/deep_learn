              (International  Federation for Information Processing), serves to foster 
              international interaction and cooperation on research topics  such as
              specification and verification of sequential, object-  oriented, and concurrent
              systems; logical and algebraic  foundations of specification and verification;
              and software  tools to support verification efforts. Up to 100 researchers 
              from a number of countries are expected to attend.  ***
