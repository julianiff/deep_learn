Abstract    :
              The investigator, a CEDAR post-doctoral awardee, develops an empirical global
              ionospheric electric field model, using all available incoherent scatter radar
              ion drift measurements and some satellite observations.  His model includes
              longitudinal, latitudinal, altitudinal, seasonal, solar cycle, and geomagnetic
              variations of the ionospheric electric field, and extends from equatorial to
              high latitudes from the E to the upper F region.  High, mid and low latitude
              results are extended to lower altitudes by theoretical model results.  Mid, low
              and equatorial electric field perturbations include prompt penetration electric
              fields from high to low latitudes, and electric field effects of the
              ionospheric disturbance dynamo.  The model significantly improves and extends
              existing global empirical electric field models, and also provides realistic
              electric field estimates for applying global ionospheric electric field
              distribution.
