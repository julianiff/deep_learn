Abstract    :
              Graves  9714985   The Material Handling Research Colloquium (MHRC) is a biannual
              event that   attracts the leading researchers in the field, focuses on the
              current state  of material handling research, and influences future directions
              for research.  The prime goal of the 1998 MHRC is to enhance its stature as a
              major international forum that strengthens and broadens communication   between
              U.S. researchers, both academic and industrial, and their counterparts in
              Europe and Asia.   A second goal is to increase the participation of the
              material handling user community of researchers and the site of Motorola
              Semiconductor and educational facilities in Tempe,   Arizona is expected to
              assist in this regard.  In addition to Motorola Corporation, the Material
              Handling Institute, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Georgia Institute of
              Technology, the University of Louisville, and Penn State University are
              co-sponsors along with the National   Science Foundation.   Encouraging this
              MHRC model for research interaction and communication in   the international
              research community should help to link the U.S. focus on system operations to
              the European focus on equipment design and the Pacific run focus on controls
              and intelligent systems.  A successful 1998 MHRC should also see increased
              numbers of user industry researchers   participating with academies and
              material handling equipment producer representation.
