Abstract    :
              AST-9714275  Lin    A key issue associated with emergence and survival of life 
              under extreme environments is the delineation of habitable  zones. 
              Conventional investigations have focused on the  existence of water on the
              surface of planets as a  consequence of radiative heating provided by their
              host  stars.  Dr. Douglas Lin and coworkers will examine the  persistent
              existence of a sub-surface liquid water layer as  a consequence of tidal
              heating in satellites around planets.  Through a case study of the tidal
              interaction between Pluto  and Charon, these researchers will examine this
              process as  an effective mechanism for heating satellite interiors.  A 
              systematic analysis will be carried out to test the  hypothesis that the
              persistent energy dissipation within  Charon is adequate to preserve liquid
              water below its ice  crust.  A similar analysis is planned for the tidal 
              interaction between Uranus and its satellites.  This award  is made through the
              NSF's special competition on Life in  Extreme Environments, with participation
              by the Division of  Astronomical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary 
              Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical  Sciences.
