Abstract    :
              9714310  Maki  Yellowstone Lake, WY is situated in the caldera of one of the
              largest volcanic eruptions known.  Geothermally heated water percolating
              through the relic chamber is highly enriched in carbonates, silicates,
              chloride, and methane, with some location additionally rich in iron and
              sulfide.  The proposed interdisciplinary research will provide background
              necessary to begin modeling basin-wide fluxes of mineral components to
              elucidate the contribution of geothermally altered groundwaters to the
              biogeochemistry of receiving systems.  The overall objective is to develop a
              quantitative understanding leading to a biogeochemical flux and mass balance
              model for the hydrothermal vent system.  Specific objectives include:  (1)
              determining the importance of vent and fumarole emanations relative to shallow
              groundwater and sediment-water flux, (2) identifying short and long-term
              variability in submarine vent activity, (3) assessing the potential geochemical
              interactions of phosphate and arsenic with iron during formation of iron oxides
              formed via vent fluid interactions with cold lake water, (4) determining the
              relative importance of abiotic sulfur oxidation and microbially-mediated sulfur
              oxidation, (5) determining the specific contributions of photosynthethic,
              heterotrophic and chemolithotrophic biomass production, and (6) analyzing
              transformations of S by measuring the stable isotope composition of minerals,
              organic matter, and micro- and macroorganisms.   This proposal was submitted in
              response to the Environmental Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry (EGB)
              solicitation, NSF 96-152.  The proposed research is collaborative with R.
              Cuhel, J. Val Klump, C. Remsen, C. Aguilar, and R. Paddock of the University of
               Wisconsin at Milwaukee.  The project is being jointly funded by the Divisions
              of Earth Sciences, Environmental Biology,  Chemistry, and the MPS Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities.
