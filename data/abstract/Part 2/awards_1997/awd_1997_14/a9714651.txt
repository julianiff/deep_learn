Abstract    :
              Third generation personal communication systems are likely to involve many
              bursty, mobile, multi-media users whose quality of service needs may vary
              dynamically over time.  In order for a wireless system to respond adequately to
              these demands it will be necessary to determine fundamental mechanisms for
              allocating QoS needs in the radio environment.  Unlike fiber optic links, radio
              links are likely to be expensive and of poorer quality. Thus, a large part of
              the quality of service arbitration will have to be  supported via coding and
              other link enhancements techniques.    In this proposal, we first present
              findings that reveal the importance of higher order error statistics in
              assessing the impact of particular forms of error control on higher layer
              services.  Then we note that when  communications are conducted over a layered
              stack, a particular error control module exerts influence on the overall end to
              end performance not only via its own error correcting capabilities but also via
              the type of error events that it passes up to the higher layers.  Therefore, we
              propose to investigate error management mechanisms that not only correct errors
              but also shape and possibly exploit the statistics of the residual errors that
              escape to the higher layers.  Finally, given a set of end user performance
              requirements, one can conceive of multiple ways of distributing the error
              control functions.  So, we propose to investigate how to distribute the error
              control functions.  We expect that the proposed work will help in the design of
              a new generation of network radios.
