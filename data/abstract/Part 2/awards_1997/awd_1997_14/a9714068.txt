Abstract    :
              This proposal addresses issues pertaining to low-frequency MHD wave generation
              and propagation in the magnetosheath-magnetopause region.  This is a
              theoretical investigation focused on the conditions in the magnetosheath region
              during periods of quasi-perpendicular bow shocks.  Four interrelated topics
              will be considered: (a) MHD wave activity in the magnetosheath; (b) field-line
              resonance and mode conversion (to kinetic Alfven waves (KAWs) at the
              magnetopause; (c) comparison of theoretically predicted wave properties and
              spectra with observations in the magnetosheath and mangetopause; (d)
              time-dependent patchy reconnection and transport driven by KAWs.  Analytical
              work, supported by numerics where needed, rather than full numerical
              simulations, is envisaged, using a kinetic MHD model developed by the PI.  In
              this model, the plasma is treated in terms of a cold core component and a hot
              component that is described kinetically.
