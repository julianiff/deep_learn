              ABSTRACT  NCR-9714696  Zeger, Kenneth  Institution: University of California -
              San Diego  Title: Low Complexity Joint Source and Channel Coding 
              ________________________________________________________________    The goal of
              the project is to develop effective joint source-channel coding techniques. 
              The main objectives are to achieve a deep theoretical understanding of combined
              source-channel codes and to develop practical  algorithms that can effectively
              be used in real applications such as low-bandwidth image compression and
              low-delay speech coding.    Very narrow bandwidth transmission channels, such
              as in mobile cellular telephony, require efficient coding schemes to protect
              the transmitted source information from the corruptive effects of channel
              errors.  In particular, low complexity techniques are needed for low delay real
              time implementations.  This  project will investigate joint source-channel
              coding techniques with an emphasis on image, video, and speech coding
              applications. Both packetized and non-packetized transmission systems will be
              studied.    A summary of the topics to be investigated is given below:    --
              Variable Rate Source Coding for Noisy Channels.    -- Optimal Tradeoff Between
              Source Coding and Channel Coding.    -- Feedback Control for Progressive and
              Region Selective     Image Transmission for Wireless Communication Channels.   
              -- Structured Index Assignment, Vector Quantization, and Channel Coding
