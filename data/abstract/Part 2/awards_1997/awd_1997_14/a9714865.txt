Abstract    :
              9714865  TUMEO    This award will support a planning visit by Dr. Mark Tumeo, 
              University of Alaska, Fairbanks, to New Zealand to develop a  cooperative
              research project with Dr. Jacqueline Aislabie of  the Manaaki Whenua-Landcare
              Research Institute on oil-  degrading bacteria which they have isolated  from
              spill  sites in Antarctica.  The aims of the intended research are  to assess
              the impacts of fuel importation in Antarctica and  the viability of using
              indigenous  bacteria in Antarctica as  part of ongoing soil remediation
              efforts.
