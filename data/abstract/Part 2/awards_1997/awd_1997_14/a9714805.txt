Abstract    :
              The Department of Atmospheric Sciences at University of Arizona requests
              matching funds to enhance the primary server that is used to support
              instructional laboratory workstations.  In addition, several monitors and high
              resolution monitors are requested to better facilitate the display of graphical
              data and satellite pictures.  Tape library hardware is requested to enable the
              Department to serve the community as a data archive.  This request is driven by
              increased demand on current systems related to upgrades in Unidata software,
              changing course requirements, and escalating student and faculty use of Unidata
              provided software.
