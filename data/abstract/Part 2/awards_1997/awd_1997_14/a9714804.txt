Abstract    :
              The investigators continue studying the coupled thermosphere/ionosphere system
              at the equator under a program referred to as MISETA (Multi-Instrumented
              Studies of Equatorial Thermosphere Aeronomy).  MISETA involves coordinated
              measurements by a variety of instruments at Jicamarca, Ancon, and Arequipa in
              Peru.  These instruments provide data on the neutral and ionized atmosphere,
              including vertical and zonal ion drifts, electron densities, ion, electron and
              neutral temperatures, zonal, meridional and vertical neutral winds, spread-F
              and scintillation activity.  The investigators examine and characterize solar
              variations in the equatorial thermospheric winds and temperatures, and how
              these variations relate to developing scintillation activity and spread-F.  The
              all-sky imaging data characterizes developing depletions and F-region
              structures as conditions become more dynamic with the higher solar fluxes. 
              They also observe developing zonal wind and temperature asymmetry with
              anti-correlated F-region gradients as the increasing plasma density couples
              into the zonal motions introduced by gravity wave oscillations, resulting in
              conversion of gravity wave energy into a localized region of heating.  The
              researchers are coordinating observations with the Jicamarca Radio Observatory
              to observe the gravity wave effects in horizontal and vertical ion drifts. 
              MISETA is a collaborative effort involving scientists at Clemson University,
              Boston College, and Boston University.
