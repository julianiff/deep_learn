Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9714078  HUDSON, KEITH    The University of Arkansas at Little
              Rock is planning to become a research sit of the University of Tennessee
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center I/UCRC for Measurement and
              Controls.  This planning grant funds an industry/university planning meeting at
              the University of Arkansas at Little Rock to determine if an industrial
              research agenda can be developed that will be supported by sufficient companies
              to form a multi-university I/UCRC.    Projects proposed for industrial
              consideration and to augment the I/UCRC for Measurement and Control are 1.) 
              Multi-Wave Opacity Monitor;  2.) Study of High Energy Nitrogen Fuels for Hybrid
              Rockets;  3.) Investigation of Smokeless Propellants for Air Bag Deployment;  
              4.) Determination of Combustion Efficiency of Smokeless Powders;  and 5.) An
              Improved Raman Gas Analyzer for Smoke Stack Emissions.
