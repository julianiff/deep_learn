Abstract    :
                This project will support improvements to the Coral Reef  Research Foundation
              Laboratory in Koror, Polau, Western  Caroline Islands.  The CRRF Laboratory is
              a new facility  which is rapidly developing a group of outside researchers  and
              education programs that use the facility.  Palau is an  area of high marine
              diversity with a wide variety of marine  habitats, including tropical marine
              lakes which are  extremely rare.  The CRRF Laboratory is heavily committed to 
              assisting researchers and education programs, while  maintaining an in-house
              program of species-level marine  diversity and other marine biological
              research.  The project  will support the acquisition of laboratory equipment 
              (microscopy, general laboratory instrumentation, computer  equipment) and
              materials for construction of a small wet  laboratory for use by education
              programs and outside  researchers.
