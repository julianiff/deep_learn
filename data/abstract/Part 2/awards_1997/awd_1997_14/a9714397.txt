Abstract    :
                  9714397  Mullen     This project represents a collaborative effort between
              Dr. Sanders (Individual award, ATM-9712925) and Dr. Mullen.  It involves an
              investigation of the impact of initial data uncertainty and model error on, and
              the usefulness of ensemble forecasting techniques for, medium range (3-5 day)
              prediction of explosive cyclogenesis.  The principals investigators are
              employing fields from a long-term climate simulation with NCAR's Community
              Climate Model (CCM2) as well as analyses and operational forecasts of a classic
              case of explosive cyclogenesis which was observed during the Experiment on
              Rapidly Intensifying Cyclones over the Atlantic (ERICA) project.  Critical
              issues to be explored include the design of initial perturbations, the minimum
              number of members for the ensemble and the minimum resolution required for
              ensemble forecast purposes.      The results of this research could be of
              enormous practical benefit to operational weather forecasting.
