Abstract    :
              Abstract - Lee    This effort explores a possible dynamic relationship between
              the propagation speed and surface properties of turbulent premixed flames. 
              Both flame surface properties and propagation speed are measured directly in
              fixed burner geometries.  Recent findings of several researchers show that the
              rate of increase of the turbulent flame surface area is substantially lower
              than that for the observed flame speeds, casting doubt on Damkohler's
              assumption that the flame speed is proportional to the wrinkled flame surface
              area.  This study addresses the source of this discrepancy and also gives
              fundamental insight into the mechanisms that cause the flame speed to increase
              as flame surface properties change with increasing turbulence.  Two burner
              geometries are used:  a pulsed-flame flow reactor that produces a freely
              propagating turbulent premixed flame, and a coaxial jet flame burner that
              stabilizes highly-turbulent premixed flames.  Diagnostics include high-speed
              photography, conditional laser Doppler velocimetry for flame speed
              measurements, and two- and three-dimensional imaging for flame surface
              properties.
