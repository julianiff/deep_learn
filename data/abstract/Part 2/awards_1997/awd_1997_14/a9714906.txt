Abstract    :
              9714906  AveLallemant   In circumstances where the convergence vector between
              two plates is oblique to the suture, deformation is partitioned into
              arc-parallel (strike-slip) and arc normal (thrust) components.  The parameters
              controlling this partitioning are not well known, and several models exist. 
              This research in the Aleutian arc takes advantage of a curved suture between
              plate where the vector varies smoothly from near O (orthogonal) to near 90o
              (pure strike-slip) to address some of the possible parameters.  If the coupling
              between upper and lower plates remains constant, increasing arc-parallel
              extension in the upper plate with increasing obliquity should be observed. 
              However, no arc-parallel extension need occur if coupling decreases with
              increasing obliquity.  This project will employ GPS technology to determine
              translations of the islands along the Aleutian arc and structural analysis to
              determine operative slip and deformation response.  Results should document
              partitioning of strain with increasing obliquity, identify operative slip
              mechanisms and allow testing of several hypotheses about partitioning in
              situation where convergent vectors are oblique to plate margins.
