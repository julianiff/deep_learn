Abstract    :
              9714882  Mackie    This is a proposal to continue research begun under a
              one-year  pilot project for investigating upper mantle electrical  conductivity
              structure under the North American continent and  urrounding oceans using very
              long period magnetotelluric (MT)  data.  A reanalysis of existing long period
              data sets collected  primarily near oceans and on islands will be complemented
              with the  acquisition of new MT data sets in continental areas, for which 
              there is currently a paucity of data. The PIs propose to use  telephone lines
              connected to buried electrodes near magnetic  observatories for recording the
              electric field data, which will be  combined with the magnetic data from the
              observatory to compute MT  response functions.  Under the pilot project, they
              have  successfully instrumented the Tulsa, Oklahoma magnetic  observatory, and
              they plan to instrument the Boulder, Colorado  observatory in early 1997. This
              continuation grant will provide  funding to instrument two additional
              observatories, and to  continue the recording over a period of three years in
              order to  obtain stable estimates  of the long period MT response functions.
