Abstract    :
              The undergraduate laboratory curricula for general chemistry, inorganic
              chemistry, physical chemistry, and instrumental analysis can be improved by
              adding a diode-array ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a
              temperature controller and a cell for spectroelectrochemistry.  Since the
              entire spectrum of a solution can be recorded in a few seconds using a
              diode-array instrument, several new experiments can be added to the chemistry
              curriculum that take advantage of the rapid data acquisition and the data
              analysis software.  Students have the opportunity to use modern, computer-based
              instrumentation beginning in their first course as they explore the absorption
              spectrum of food dyes.  Enhancements and additions to the upper-division
              laboratory curriculum include the characterization of coordination geometry
              from spectral data; kinetics experiments in which a transient intermediate is
              followed; an experiment that uses a tandem technique, spectroelectrochemistry;
              and the analysis of multicomponent systems.  This project also gives students
              experience with a system that incorporates numerous software features for data
              analysis and that illustrates validation procedures to insure data quality and
              integrity when gathering data electronically.  *
