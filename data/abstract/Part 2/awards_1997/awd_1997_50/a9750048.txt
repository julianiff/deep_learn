Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750048  D. Scott Baskerville    This action funds an
              NSF/Alfred P. Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution
              for 1997.  These  fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, 
              comparative, computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological
              patterns and processes at the molecular level  within the framework of
              organismic evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the
              use of molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each
              fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a
              sponsmring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is
              entitled "Examining the  origins of enzymes."  Most chemical reactions in
              living  systems are know to be catalyzed by protein enzymes but a  few have
              been shown to be catalyzed by RNA or RNA-protein  enzymes.  By comparing the
              abilities of synthetic protein,  RNA, and RNA-protein to give rise to new
              enzymes, this  research addresses the possibility that RNA enzymes emerged 
              more readily and were later supplanted by proteins during  evolution.
