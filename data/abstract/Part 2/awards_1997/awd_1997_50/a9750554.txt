Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry at San Jose State University is strongly committed
              to undergraduate education and research in the chemical sciences.  Recent
              curricular developments in the department have encouraged the development of a
              spiral approach to laboratory instrumentation.  Two Fourier Transform Infrared
              (FTIR) spectrometers have been purchased for use by students in courses
              throughout the curriculum.      Students are introduced to the Fourier
              Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy early in their freshman year. 
              Experiments incorporating FTIR laboratory experiments have been coupled with
              existing experiments in organic, physical, and instrumental analysis
              laboratories.  A new inorganic chemistry laboratory and a new multidivisional
              capstone laboratory course provides additional experiments which use the FTIR
              to solve experimental problems covering topics relevant to the surrounding
              scientific and industrial communities (i.e., Silicon Valley).    *
