Abstract    :
              The primary objective of this project is to enhance student understanding of
              computer science. This goal is being achieved by instilling in students an
              appreciation for the conceptual links between the principles and techniques of
              the varied areas within computer science.  In particular, the project is
              designed to (1) integrate courses to present material within the context of the
               discipline as a whole, (2) design courses to focus student learning on
              realistic projects that demonstrate a synergism of concepts and techniques from
              multiple areas within computer science, and (3) deliver the content and
              projects of the upper-division curriculum through a medium that supports
              collaborative team learning.    Many current approaches to undergraduate
              curricula seem to encourage students' misperception of computer science as a
              loosely linked collection of technical topics.  Students do not experience, and
              often fail to appreciate, the synergetic integration of topics that occurs
              during the analysis, design, and implementation of practical computer science
              applications.  *
