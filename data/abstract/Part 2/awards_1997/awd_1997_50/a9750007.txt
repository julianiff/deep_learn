Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750007  Seung-Chul Kim    This action funds an NSF/Alfred
              P. Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997. 
              These  fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic
              evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the use of
              molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship
              supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring
              laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "The Transfer  of Genetic Adaptations between Wild Sunflower Species." 
              Interspecific transfer of genetic adaptations through  hybridization and
              backcrossing (introgression) is thought to  be common in plants but has been
              difficult to prove.  The  research and training plan supported here will employ
               genetic mapping tools to verify experimentally the  introgressive origin of
              several adaptive morphological  features in Helianthus annus ssp. texanus. 
              This is a new  subspecies putatively derived via the introgression of H. 
              debilis genes into H. annus.
