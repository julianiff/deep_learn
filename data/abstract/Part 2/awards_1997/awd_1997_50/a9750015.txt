Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750015  Daniel Oppenheimer    This action funds an
              NSF/Alfred P. Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution
              for 1997.  These  fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, 
              comparative, computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological
              patterns and processes at the molecular level  within the framework of
              organismic evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the
              use of molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each
              fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a
              sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is
              entitled "Using  baculovirus vectors to study the evolution of segmentation  in
              arthropods." Although expression patterns of many  developmental genes in a
              wide range of arthropods are known,  the functions of these genes are not
              known.  This research  uses baculoviruses which infect a broad range of
              arthropods  to control the expression of specific developmental genes in  many
              insect and crustacean species. Evolutionary  relationships of gene function
              will be made by comparing  effects of gene misexpression in different species.
