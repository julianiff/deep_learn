Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750012  Paulyn Cartwright    This action funds an
              NSF/Alfred P. Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution
              for 1997.  These  fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, 
              comparative, computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological
              patterns and processes at the molecular level  within the framework of
              organismic evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the
              use of molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each
              fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a
              sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is
              entitled "The Molecular  Mechanisms of Sex Determination in the Evolution of 
              Flowering Plants."  It addresses whether the male sex  determining mechanism
              involving the gene TASSELSEED 2 in  maize operates in other grass species.  The
              research  involves characterizing the developmental morphology, the  nature and
              timing of female organ abortion, and TASSELSEED2  expression in several grass
              species.  This information,  mapped onto a phylogeny, will address whether or
              not the  same mechanism is involved in the evolution of re-occurring  character
              and is an important first step in understanding  the molecular mechanisms
              underlying sex determination in  flowering plants.
