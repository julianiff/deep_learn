Abstract    :
              A new chemistry curriculum designed around FT-infrared and UV-visible
              spectroscopy instrumentation is allowing students to approach the subject in a
              variety of non-traditional ways. The majority of our graduates enter
              technician-level positions and need to be familiar with chemical principles as
              well as the operation of various instruments. They are often responsible for
              calibration and maintenance. Spectroscopy applications intrigue students in
              many technology fields, and allow interest in computers or instrument design to
              drive their understanding of chemistry principles. Since all of our chemistry
              classes use the same laboratory, it is possible to give students access to
              instruments beginning with their first chemistry course. With this facility,
              spectroscopy is being used as a means to introduce chemical principles and to
              acquaint students with instrument operation and maintenance. The use of current
              spectroscopy instrumentation also is enhancing discovery-based laboratories
              used to individualize student understanding of chemical principles and to help
              apply those principles to specific examples in the student's field of study.
              Augmenting the chemistry portfolios, prepared for each class, with examples of
              this sort makes the portfolio assessment tool more powerful for students
              throughout their careers.  *
