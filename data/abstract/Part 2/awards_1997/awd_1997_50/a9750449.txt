Abstract    :
              Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the fundamental spectroscopic methods
              used by scientists for determining chemical structure.  It is imperative that
              undergraduate students learn how to acquire and interpret NMR spectra. 
              Students at the University have previously studied spectral interpretation
              using NMR data bases or from spectra obtained by technicians.  They acquire no
              direct experience in operating the spectrometer.  Recent developments in rapid
              scanning NMR spectrometers permit a spectrum to be acquired in 10 seconds. 
              Thus it is possible to provide hands-on experience for laboratories of 24
              students in undergraduate course at Hartford.   Students are also gaining
              experience in collaborative learning and a team approach to research problems. 
                NMR spectroscopy is introduced along with other instruments in the first-year
              chemistry laboratory, in keeping with the trend in chemical education to
              introduce students to instrumentation early in their college education.  The
              main focus of the NMR is in organic chemistry and subsequent laboratory
              courses.  The instrument is used to support group projects that culminate with
              presentation of results by students.  Student in more advanced courses have
              acquired the skill and confidence to use the NMR in more advanced applications
              including research projects.  *
