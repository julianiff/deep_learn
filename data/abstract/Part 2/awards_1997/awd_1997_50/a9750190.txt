Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750190  Gregory M. Erickson    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "How bones of  amphibious fish
              are modified for terrestrial locomotion  during evolutionary water-to-land
              transitions."  The  emergence of vertebrates onto land was made possible by 
              biomechanical modification of the appendicular skeleton.  The nature of such
              changes is being determined by testing  the biomechanical properties of bones
              from amphibious fish  and their aquatic sister taxa.  The results are important
               for understanding how bone form and function are regulated  by mechanical
              demand during evolution.
