Abstract    :
              The Department of Geography and Earth Science is dedicated exclusively to the
              education of undergraduate students. The project is modernizing the curriculum
              in the department with the addition of a computer laboratory.  The computer
              laboratory is significantly affecting the curriculum in several ways.  First,
              it is increasing the exposure of majors to the tools of geographic information
              systems and remote-sensing in four of the upper-level courses.  Second, it is
              enabling the department to incorporate a vast array of available multimedia and
              Internet resources into the introductory courses.   Third, it is undergirding a
              new course for students preparing to be K-12 teachers, called "Geography for
              Life," and will enable at least one other course for teachers planned in the
              Earth Sciences, tentatively titled "Computer Tools for Earth Science Teachers."
               Fourth, advanced courses that use mathematical or computer models are being
              given a facility that can be used for demonstrations and laboratories. 
              Finally, the department wants to provide a facility that students can use for
              projects, independent research, and presentations.  *
