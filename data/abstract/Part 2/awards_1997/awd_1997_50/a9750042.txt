Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750042  Melissa A. Fleming    This action funds an
              NSF/Alfred P. Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution
              for 1997.  These  fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, 
              comparative, computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological
              patterns and processes at the molecular level  within the framework of
              organismic evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the
              use of molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each
              fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a
              sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is
              entitled "Evolutionary  history and distribution of ermine and mink subspecies
              in  southeast Alaska."  Glaciation and sea level changes have  repeatedly
              fragmented the landscape of southeast Alaska and  coastal British Columbia. 
              This has generated high levels of  paleo- and neoendemism.  This research uses
              mitochrondrial  and nuclear DNA analyses to investigate the phylogeography  of
              two mammalian species with island endemics in the region  that are of potential
              conservation concern:  mink and  ermine.
