Abstract    :
              A major goal of the Department of Physics is the improvement of a topical course
              for non-science-majors entitled Physics of Music.  This course treats the
              physics of motion and waves and investigates such topics as musicians' and
              physicists' perceptions of the same sounds, the construction of musical scales,
              and the physical attributes of the major groupings of musical instruments. 
              Historically, this course has been a lecture course with only three short
              laboratory exercises.  The project is significantly enhancing the course by
              adding a weekly laboratory designed to acquaint each student more effectively
              with the nature of physics and the interplay between experiment and theory. 
              The laboratory is also giving each student a more secure, personal familiarity
              with the physical phenomena discussed in the course.  The new equipment is
              supporting experiments on the spectral composition of the sounds produced by
              various musical instruments and on the nature of resonance as an important
              characteristic of musical instruments.  This development is likely to increase
              the number of non-science-majors electing physics courses, and is contributing
              to the department's response to increasingly strident national calls that
              science departments give renewed attention to their offerings for
              non-science-majors.
