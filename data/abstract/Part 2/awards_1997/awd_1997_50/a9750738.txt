Abstract    :
              This project focuses on enhancing the quality of undergraduate education for
              electrical engineers by incorporating the most relevant demand areas in
              technology into the undergraduate curriculum. The explosive growth in fiber
              optics and optoelectronics is expected to create a huge demand for trained
              engineers in that area. To make students proficient with state-of-the-art
              technology, the project is developing two new laboratory courses in fiber
              optics and optoelectronics. These two laboratories complement the courses in
              fiber optical communications and semiconductor optoelectronic devices that are
              being planned for the near future.    These laboratories are providing hands-on
              experiments that illustrate fiber optics and optoelectronics principles and
              applications. The experiments are designed in such a way that the concepts from
              the classroom are reinforced in the laboratory. The experiments vary in
              difficulty from simple operations, such as handling and measuring the numerical
              aperture of a multi-mode fiber, to very advanced procedures such as coherent
              communications.    The implementation of the new laboratory courses also
              includes the incorporation of innovative teaching techniques such as active
              learning, team learning, and corporate learning into the laboratories.  *
