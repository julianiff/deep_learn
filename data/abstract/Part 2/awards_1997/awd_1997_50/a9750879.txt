Abstract    :
              This project establishes a Capstone Experience for senior undergraduate
              geoscience students.  The major component is equipment for a networked
              Collaborative Computer Laboratory housed in the new sciences center.  The
              laboratory is the major resource for an integrated course including computer,
              field work, laboratory, analytical, and publishing experiences for
              undergraduate seniors in geology and anthropology.  This Capstone Experience
              has a strong interdisciplinary component (geology, environmental sciences, and
              anthropology) and involves other universities and K 12 students.  This project
              focuses on Maine and neighboring regions and builds on the strengths of the
              university and opportunities provided by Maine's geological and geographic
              setting.  The result of this project (MAINEly Geology) is an interactive,
              multimedia presentation of geological and anthropological aspects of Maine that
              is available as a World Wide Web site and published as a CD-ROM.  It is a
              geological resource for other institutions in the Nation, as well as for
              Maine's people, and represents a model of a student-centered, inquiry-based,
              active learning experience by undergraduate students.
