Abstract    :
              Abstract      DBI 9750002  Ichiro Matsumura    This action funds an NSF/Alfred
              P. Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997. 
              These  fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic
              evolutionary change and  adaptation. These studies also include the use of
              molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship
              supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring
              laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Do enzymes  evolve like antibodies?" and investigates the role of  surface
              loops in the adaptive evolution of substrate  specificity.  This study tests
              the theory that the adaptive  evolution of enzyme substrate specificity, like
              antibody  maturation, occurs largely in surface loops.  The  evolutionary
              pathway between the betaglucuronidase and  betagalactosidase of Escherichia
              coli will be recapitulated  by randomly mutating selected beta-glucuronidase
              surface  loops and screening for mutations that alter specificity.
