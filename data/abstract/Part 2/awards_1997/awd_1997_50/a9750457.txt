Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to set up a computer laboratory for use in the
              teaching of Dynamical Systems and Differential Equations courses.  For the past
              several years, members of the dynamics group have been involved in a complete
              updating of course offerings at the undergraduate level in these areas.  Recent
              advances in technology have profoundly changed the way these courses can and
              should be taught.  No longer is it necessary to spend the bulk of time in
              differential equations classes teaching cookbook methods of solution.  Rather,
              using technology, students can compute these solutions symbolically.  Then they
              can view solutions geometrically, they can see how phase planes change as
              parameters vary, and they can explore bifurcation phenomena.  Also, it is now
              possible in dynamics courses to introduce even first-year students to such
              contemporary topics in mathematics as chaotic behavior, Julia sets, factual
              data compression, and more.  The goal of this project is to provide the
              computational equipment so that students can benefit from these types of
              enriching activities.
