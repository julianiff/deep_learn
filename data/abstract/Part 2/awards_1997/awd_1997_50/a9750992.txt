Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to expand and modernize the laboratory exercises in
              the Mechanical Engineering Technology course in Physical Measurements.  The
              course has been predominantly lecture (42 out of 60 hours).  Although the
              course material deals with more than 50 types of sensors, laboratory
              experiments allow practice with only 12 sensors, and data are taken manually,
              giving students no experience with computer data acquisition.    The objectives
              of this project are to acquire a larger number of sensors for use in additional
              exercises, so students gain practical experience and familiarity with the
              sensors; to include modern computerized data acquisition equipment and
              techniques; and to shift the course emphasis as much as possible from passive
              lecture experience to active experimental experience, while using the strengths
              of multidisciplinary teams of Electrical Engineering Technology students and
              Mechanical Engineering Technology students to broaden the knowledge of students
              from each discipline.    Articles resulting from this laboratory development
              can aid other similar programs in choosing laboratory equipment for such
              upgrades and justify and promote the use of active, versus passive, learning,
              particularly with multidisciplinary teams.  *
