Abstract    :
              The performance of concrete depends on chemistry and processing and the
              resulting microstructure and properties of the material; yet, undergraduate
              civil engineering students are not exposed to laboratories that develop these
              relationships.  For students to have the opportunity to discover the diversity
              and ultimately come to understand performance of this complex material, it is
              critical to provide relevant laboratory experiences as well as classroom
              instruction.  This project provides funding for equipment that addresses three
              basic areas of concrete materials science and engineering: (l) hydration, (2)
              flow properties, and (3) transport properties.  In combination with existing
              mechanical testing facilities, the new laboratory becomes a novel undergraduate
              experience, both from a pedagogical and content-based perspective, which brings
              together key issues in chemistry, processing, microstructure, durability, and
              mechanical performance.  The goals of this project are: (1) to engage students
              in laboratory activities that reveal the relationship among chemistry,
              processing, microstructure, and performance of concrete, (2) to shift course
              content from passive lecture-based teaching to active hands-on inquiry-based
              laboratory activities, (3) to incorporate into the laboratories elements of
              design, planning, implementation, and analysis rather than step-by-step
              follow-the-instruction exercises, (4) to permit students to direct their own
              laboratory experiences whereby each student may perform different experiments,
              (5) to promote collaboration among students to expand the knowledge base by
              combining the results of many individual experiments into a cumulative greater
              whole, and (6) to replace traditional discrete laboratory activities that
              feature single techniques with a methodology that integrates techniques and
              illustrates the relationships among experimental methods and how to interpret
              such results collectively.
