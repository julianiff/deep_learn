Abstract    :
              Astronomy is a relative newcomer among the science offerings in the community
              colleges of the area.  The new observatory is designed to bring a modern,
              well-equipped, accessible observatory to the institution's students, as well as
              students from nearby colleges, high schools, and elementary schools, and the
              general public. Cooperative work is taking place between the astronomy and
              computer science staff to accomplish this objective.   The centerpiece of the
              program is an observatory with a 16" telescope, which is to be equipped with a
              CCD camera, spectroscope, photometer, and auxiliary equipment.  Several smaller
              telescopes are also being purchased to be used for training purposes, along
              with two computers for image processing, data reduction, analysis, and storage.
