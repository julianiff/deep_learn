Abstract    :
              A high field (200 MHz) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer is being
              used to introduce students in organic chemistry courses to NMR.  They receive
              "hands on" experience in the use of the instrument and direct experience in
              obtaining information on the structures of compounds they have synthesized. 
              Student are introduced to the NMR technique early in the introductory organic
              course in both lecture and laboratory.  They will gain first hand experience in
              the use of this powerful tool for structure elucidation of organic and certain
              inorganic compounds.  They will have access to the instrument during most of
              the 15 laboratories in the two semester sequence of organic courses.  The
              instrument is also used for both qualitative and quantitative analysis by
              students in undergraduate research, quantitative analysis, and environmental
              science courses.  *
