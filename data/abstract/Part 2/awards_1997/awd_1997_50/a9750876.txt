Abstract    :
              This project involves the purchase of a medium field Fourier-transform
              nuclear-magnetic resonance (FT-NMR) spectrometer with a broad-band,
              multi-nuclear probe, and supporting hardware and software necessary to operate
              the spectrometer from the two remote instructional sites.  The networked
              spectrometer is enabling the consortium to meet the goals of this project,
              including the improvement of the quality of chemistry education, increased
              exposure for students in chemistry courses to the concepts and techniques of
              modern NMR spectroscopy, and the strengthening of the collaboration between the
              chemistry faculties of three area schools.  Hands-on instruction in NMR
              spectroscopic techniques begins with two experiments in the general chemistry
              laboratory and progresses in complexity, scope, and frequency of use through
              organic chemistry.  Undergraduate research in organic chemistry and inorganic
              chemistry is also being enhanced significantly through the acquisition of this
              instrument.
