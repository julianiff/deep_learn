Abstract    :
              A cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometer for trace level (> 10 ppb) mercury
              determinations and a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer for
              determination of other heavy metals (> sub ppb) are providing information on
              the concentrations of metals in water, waste water, and sediments to
              collaborative geoscience, chemistry, and environmental science projects. The
              instrumentation is used in the Departments of geology, Chemistry/Biochemistry,
              and in the Environmental Studies program to enhance the laboratory curricula. 
              This instrumentation facilities collaboration between the college and outside
              organizations.  The identifying theme of the project is the determination of
              trace metals in the waters and sediments of Lake Champlain.  The location of
              the college near the lake, makes it a natural laboratory for course work and
              undergraduate research.  Access to this unique opportunity is enhanced by a 32
              foot research vessel owned by the college.  Samples include sewage sludge, lake
              sediments, lake and river water, zebra mussels, and game fish.  These samples
              are providing information necessary to determine the origin, transport, and
              ultimate fate of metals in this ecosystem.  *
