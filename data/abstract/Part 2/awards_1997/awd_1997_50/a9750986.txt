Abstract    :
              Support is sought for a multimedia equipped computer classroom to integrate
              laboratory exercises throughout the major curriculum and for a courseware
              development platform which can be used by department faculty to develop
              software.  The multimedia classroom and the software developed by department
              faculty will 1) serve to integrate the relationship between collecting,
              analyzing, and interpreting psychological data; 2) add instruction on computer
              based instrumentation to existing courses, 3) expand the range of research
              paradigms students experience and work with and 4) make it possible to add
              instruction on the use of CD-ROM based research abstract data bases.  Support
              for this proposal will result in the development of a Website providing access
              to laboratory exercises in psychology which take advantage of cutting edge
              developments in multimedia presentation.  This in turn should enhance the
              educational experience of the 1400 students who take psychology courses each
              year at Gustavus Adolpus College, resulting a population of citizens better
              able to evaluate scientific claims about human behavior.  The number and types
              of research problems selected and the degree of sophistication of student
              research projects, presentations, and publications will be closely monitored to
              chart the impact of the strengthened curriculum on student learning.
