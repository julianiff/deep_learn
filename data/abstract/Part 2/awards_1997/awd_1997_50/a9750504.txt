Abstract    :
              This project is enhancing the instructional capabilities of the Farquhar
              Laboratory by upgrading the global positioning system (GPS) hardware and
              software.  The department is adding two data collector kits, an educator's
              system Pro XR receiver, and a community base station.  These items allow
              greater numbers of students to learn spatial mapping techniques more quickly
              and facilitate more sophisticated analysis of increasingly complex databases.
              The project adds to a curriculum containing a spatial literacy and mapping
              component that teaches students to collect, process, and interpret original
              data.  The department's theory of curricular development is that the
              experiences of one instructor with successive student groups diffuses to a
              wider group of faculty and students as experimental efforts prove successful. 
              For example, through in-house workshops and demonstrations, increasing numbers
              of students and faculty are beginning to see possible applications of GPS
              technology in their respective fields.  *
