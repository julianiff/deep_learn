Abstract    :
              A dedicated Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Laboratory supports the
              laboratory teaching and learning activities for two GIS introductory courses. 
              Additional advanced GIS courses result in the establishment of a comprehensive
              GIS program.  GIS courses also support two occupational /technical programs 
              Engineering Technology and Computer-Aided Drafting /Design.    The objectives
              of the project include refining the curriculum of the two GIS courses;
              providing students with hands-on laboratory activities to facilitate learning
              of GIS principles; preparing and training faculty with the theoretical
              foundation and technical skills to teach GIS; and using the two GIS courses as
              the foundation for a comprehensive GIS program and to support 
              occupational/technical programs.    The evaluation plan includes both process
              evaluation and outcome evaluation components that will use qualitative and
              quantitative techniques to evaluate the project and faculty/student outcomes.
