Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750137  Katherine C. Kelley    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Genetic and  parental effects on
              the development of antipredator  characters."  It is subtitled "Experimental
              analyses of  blister beetle coloration and chemical defense."  Many  insects
              are chemically defended and advertise their  noxiousness to predators with
              conspicuous (aposematic)  coloration, but the inheritance mechanisms underlying
               intraspecific variation in these traits are largely unknown.  Developmental,
              quantitative genetic, and experimental  approaches are being combined to
              measure genetic and  parental effects on the coloration and chemical defense of
               blister beetles.  This research provides a mechanistic  understanding of
              insect aposematism and a novel analysis of  constraints on character suite
              integration.
