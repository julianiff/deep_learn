Abstract    :
              The chemistry laboratory is the most important tool to train students for their
              future professional, industrial, or academic careers in or related to
              Chemistry.  The goal of laboratory courses is to teach students fundamental
              chemical concepts while exposing them to instrumentation they may encounter
              after graduation.  While the Chemistry Department had made great strides in
              obtaining state of the art instrumentation for student use, there are still
              voids to be filled with new instrumentation.  One such void would be filled by
              the acquisition of a PTI Fluorescence Spectrophotometer.  The current chemistry
              and biochemistry curriculum covers fluorescence techniques in a cursory one or
              two day lecture.  Fluorescence methods have become important in all areas of
              chemical and, in particular, biochemical research.  With the large percentage
              of Biochemistry majors in the department, the introduction to fluoescence
              techniques becomes more important to prepare our students for their future
              endeavors.  The acquisition of the PTI fluoescence spectrophotometer will
              impact five upper division laboratory courses (Chemistry 121, 122, 125, 131,
              and 133) and possibly other special topics courses currently under discussion. 
              The addition of fluorescence methods and techniques to the department also
              provide and additional research tool that will be utilized by several current
              faculty members.   *
