Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750329  Lorraine G. van Waasbergen    This action funds an
              NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment
              for 1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Cyanobacteria  as a model system
              for light perception in plants."  Blue/UV-  A light controls numerous aspects
              of plant growth.  High  intensity white light causes oxidative photodamage in 
              plants.  Both types of light activate some important plant  genes suggesting
              that the cellular perception of these  signals is interconnected.  This
              research uses a recently  discovered gene, hliA, in cyanobacteria that is
              induced in  response to both high light and blue light.  Cyanobacteria,  the
              blue-green algae, are serving as a model for higher  plants to identify
              components of the signal transduction  pathways involved in sensing and control
              of gene expression  by various plant pigments.  If possible, a blue light 
              receptor will be identified.
