Abstract    :
              Since plastics account for approximately 20 percent of the landfill volume,
              recycling plastics plays a significant role in reducing solid waste flow.
              Students must be educated in the methods of recycling plastics and better
              controlling the properties of products made from recycled materials.    This
              project is enhancing materials recycling experiments by adding study of the
              microstructural change in plastics due to recycling. These experiments are done
              using a scanning electron microscope. These experiments include collecting and
              cleaning postconsumer containers, grinding, extrusion compounding and
              pelletizing, dry injection molding, and analyzing the structure of recycled
              plastics. With the implementation of this project, students are able to better
              understand the change in polymeric structure caused by recycling, and to
              control the properties of the recycled materials using the structure property
              relationship.    Students in the technology majors and non-science-majors are
              gaining fundamental understanding and practical experience through this series
              of experiments. They are gaining knowledgeable insight into reducing, reusing,
              and recycling plastics.  *
