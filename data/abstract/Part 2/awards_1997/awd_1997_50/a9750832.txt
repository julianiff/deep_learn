Abstract    :
                Recent studies have indicated that the Nation will soon face a critical
              shortage of microbiologists trained in industrial microbiology.  In response to
              this need, the Department of Biology and Microbiology is developing a new
              industrial microbiology laboratory course to complement the existing
              lecture-based Industrial and Fermentation Microbiology course.  The department
              is acquiring equipment to be used in this course and making significant
              improvements to the laboratory component of the Bacterial Physiology course
              required of microbiology majors.    The improvements are providing microbiology
              majors with a strong background in basic microbiological concepts.  More
              importantly, it is enabling them to gain hands-on experience in the application
              of these concepts in the intricately related fields of bacterial physiology and
              industrial microbiology.  The department acquiring bench top fermenters, a
              large shaker incubator, cell harvesting and disruption equipment, microtiter
              plate readers, and a biochemistry analyzer.  This equipment is enabling
              students to gain experience in the use of the state-of-the-art equipment
              commonly found in industrial settings and meeting the growing need for
              microbiologists trained in traditional and industrial microbiology.
