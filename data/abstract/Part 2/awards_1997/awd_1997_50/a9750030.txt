Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750030  Susan C. Jacobs    This action funds an NSF/Alfred
              P. Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997. 
              These  fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic
              evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the use of
              molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship
              supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring
              laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Evolution of  the X-linked color vision gene in squirrel monkeys."  Monkeys of
              the genus Saimiri possess one autosomal and one X-  linked color photopigment
              gene.  Three alleles of the X-  linked gene have been identified.  Maintenance
              of  heterozygosity at this locus has been attributed to foraging  advantages. 
              The hypothesis of heterozygote advantage  predicts the existence of additional
              alleles at this locus.  This research examines genetic diversification in the
              X-  linked color vision gene among Saimiri.
