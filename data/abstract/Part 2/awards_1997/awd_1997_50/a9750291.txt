Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750291  Carol E. Lee    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Evolution of  physiology during
              habitat transitions."  It is subtitled  "Repeated invasion of fresh water by a
              common crustacean."  All animal phyla evolved in the sea, and most have 
              successfully made the transition to fresh water.  This  transition requires
              adapting to ionic and osmotic changes.  The crustacean copepod Eurytemora
              affinis has recently  invaded freshwater reservoirs from salt water multiple
              times  independently.  Experiments are designed to determine  changes in body
              fluid regulation during these repeated  habitat transitions by combining
              physiological and  phylogenetic information.  Insights are being sought on how 
              physiology evolves during biogeographic transitions and how  species
              successfully invade new habitats.
