Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to provide the equipment necessary to upgrade the
              undergraduate Surface Physics Laboratory.  A pilot surface physics program,
              concentrating on sputtering, has been successful.  One of the accomplishments
              of the current program has been the development of collaborations (research and
              student internships) with local semiconductor companies.  The new equipment
              enables the department to build on current successes and develop new courses
              covering a broader area of surface physics.  This program is providing unique
              opportunities for students to acquire summer internships and permanent
              employment in positions requiring knowledge and laboratory experience in vacuum
              technology, sputtering, and thin films.  A UHV chamber and magnetron sputtering
              system are being used to deposit films.  A quartz crystal microbalance is being
              used to control film thickness.  Four-point probe resistivity measurements,
              optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive
              spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy are being used to
              characterize the films.
