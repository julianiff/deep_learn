Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750211  Catharina Casper-Lindley    This action funds an
              NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment
              for 1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Physiological  and molecular
              analysis of photodamage accompanying  photosynthesis."  Light fuels
              photosynthetic carbon dioxide  fixation but also damages a protein crucial to 
              photosynthesis.  This project examines the natural rates of  damage and repair
              of D1, the main target protein of  photodamage; the composition of the
              degradation complex  after photodamage; and the proteins and respective genes 
              involved in the damage/repair cycle of D1, using mutants of  Chlamydomonas and
              barley.
