Abstract    :
              The project focuses on the modernization and upgrading of existing
              instrumentation with construction of computer links for a sixty-five foot
              instructional and research vessel on Seneca Lake.  The two courses most
              affected are Physical Oceanography and Meteorology.  These two courses are the
              most quantitatively offered in the department, and deal with numerous aspects
              of fluid dynamics.  The field/laboratory components of both courses take the
              mathematics and physics into the real world of weather and water.  The
              institution's research vessel enables students to get hands-on shipboard
              experience with the techniques and processes studied in class.  Laboratory
              experiences that demonstrate instruments and allow the interpretation of
              archived data have to be converted into ones that provide for the analysis and
              interpretation of relevant data. Acquisition of this equipment is giving
              students an experience more like that of the practicing professional scientist.
