Abstract    :
              This project improves instrumentation of the introductory VLSI design course,
              adds instrumentation for an analog VLSI design course, and provides for a
              special topics course in VLSI that emphasizes design strategies usually not
              covered in undergraduate courses.  This is part of a goal in the Electrical
              Engineering Division to expand the VLSI curriculum from one current
              introductory course to a pyramid of courses structured to teach the students
              VLSI design from several aspects.  Emphasis of the new VLSI design curriculum
              is on design methodologies and specific applied design paradigms.  The new
              tools are used solely on personal computers, and the courses are designed so
              the instructor can teach the laboratories with little or no computer technical
              assistance.  The laboratories are designed so that one or two faculty can be
              used with help from workstudy students.  The introductory course is offered to
              both juniors and seniors.  Students taking the course in their junior year have
              the advantage of more detailed VLSI design experience in their senior year. 
              Expansion of VLSI design can increase the student's proficiency in analog
              design using full custom design and digital design using synthesis tools.  In
              the VLSI special topics course, students work as a single group on a design
              problem and emphasis is on design methodologies, time to market strategies,
              design for testability, and design for quality.    *
