Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to provide a new undergraduate laboratory
              course in environmental health physics that can be taken by junior students
              from environmental engineering, nuclear engineering, and engineering physics,
              as well as students from other disciplines.  This new laboratory course is
              developed based upon the existing nuclear engineering laboratory courses. 
              However, new experiments with emphasis on environmental radioactive waste
              characterization using gamma-spectroscopy technology are being developed and
              added to the course.  The project provides an HPGe detector system.  Other
              experiments using existing equipment can be upgraded.  The whole course is
              redesigned to facilitate problem-based learning which can be enhanced by
              extensive use of multimedia computer tools for data acquisition, analysis, and
              visualization.  Such a modern interdisciplinary laboratory course provides much
              needed hands-on experience for students in some of the very demanding technical
              areas including environmental restoration, nuclear waste management,
              environmental risk assessment, radioactive and mixed waste disposal, and
              reliability and safety analysis.  *
