Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750135  Leslie Pray    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "A field study  of genetic
              variation and population structure in New England  salamander communities." 
              Contextual analysis is being used  to estimate selection among clones,
              selection between clones  and their parental species, and selection among pond 
              communities in New England populations of the unisexual  salamander Ambystoma
              laterale-(2)jeffersonianum.    Clones  and clonal variants are identified by
              allozyme and DNA data,  and fitness data are collected in the field.
