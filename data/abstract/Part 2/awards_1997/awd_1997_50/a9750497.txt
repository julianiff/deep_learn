Abstract    :
              This project develops a contemporary microprocessor learning laboratory that
              uses sophisticated software tools.  This project provides software development
              tools, single-board 32-bit computers for embedded applications, an embedded
              operating system, and servo trainers.  The software development tools provide a
              full-feature C++ compiler, a sophisticated debugger, and a real-time operating
              system kernel.  These software tools can be used with laboratory test platforms
              that the department has designed over the years.  The servo trainers are the
              test beds for the fuzzy logic control algorithms.  These platforms can be set
              up to simulate a broad class of commonly occurring non-ideal properties for
              control problems.  The laboratory experiments provide the students with
              interesting challenges for fuzzy logic control.  Approximately one-fourth of
              the class time will be spent on real-time fuzzy logic control.    Universities
              have been slow to implement software automation tools in microprocessor
              courses.  Industry has moved very aggressively in this direction, making the
              university training less relevant.  Industry, particularly in Japan, has also
              been very quick to implement fuzzy logic algorithms in many products while
              universities have lagged in the implementation of fuzzy logic control in
              curriculums.  Embedded computers provide options for control that are not
              available using classical control theory, and fuzzy logic provides the formal
              set of rules for implementing these systems.  Fuzzy logic instruction makes
              sense in an engineering technology program since very sophisticated control
              algorithms can be implemented with a limited mathematical background.  *
