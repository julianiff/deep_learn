Abstract    :
              The project establishes a computer graphics laboratory in the Chemistry
              Department to enable students to gain hands-on experience in molecular
              visualization, modeling, and computational techniques.  The laboratory is used
              by students in courses in organic chemistry, physical organic chemistry, and
              molecular modeling.  Chemical concepts are demonstrated in course lectures
              using computer graphics and visualization, and students perform assigned
              exercises themselves in the laboratory to reinforce and extend their learning
              of the concepts.  Two sessions of the organic chemistry experimental laboratory
              course are being transformed into molecular modeling sessions, and the graphics
              laboratory is being used extensively for the current elective course on
              molecular modeling.  Independent, student-initiated molecular modeling projects
              are being encouraged, and the new equipment allows for sophisticated studies. 
              The effectiveness of incorporating computer methods into undergraduate
              chemistry will be reported at national meetings and in research papers.  This
              project is advancing involvement with collaborators at the University of
              Massachusetts, the University of California at Santa Cruz, and elsewhere in
              preparing a syllabus for the use of molecular modeling in the undergraduate
              curriculum.     *
