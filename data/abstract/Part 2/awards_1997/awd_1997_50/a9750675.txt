Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the enhancement of a 300 MHz Fourier-transform
              nuclear-magnetic resonance (FT-NMR) system with the addition of several new
              accessories, including an inverse broad-band probe, inverse modification and
              decoupler upgrade, autosampler, and software and hardware for a supplementary
              Pentium-based workstation.  The new inverse probe and electronics are allowing
              access to a wide range of enhanced-sensitivity, inversely detected NMR methods
              and other critical experiments (such as 1H observation with 14N decoupling);
              enormously increasing effective use of the instrument by permitting more
              spectra to be run for entire classes (with the autosampler); and both simplify
              and extend instrument use with the workstation.  Major applications will be in
              microscale organic chemistry laboratory, biochemistry, physical chemistry, and
              instrumental analysis.  With some advanced NMR spectra, requiring several
              hours, the autosampler is providing a solution to the problem of large classes
              of students individually acquiring spectra.  The workstation is offering
              simpler processing and foreground/background techniques to increase the ability
              of students to acquire and manipulate new spectra.  Use of basic macros is
              making full automated use of newer 1-D and 2-D experiments possible.  The new
              probe is providing access to experiments that provide exceptional enhancement
              of undergraduate studies.
