Abstract    :
              The development of geographical information systems (GIS) for the computerized
              management of spatial information has created a demand for the integration of
              such applications into curricula.  The Navajo Nation is planning to make this
              technology central to its efforts to manage natural resources, population
              information, environmental effects of development, and other planning
              activities for the reservation.  The need for trained Navajo professionals is
              being met by acquiring the computer hardware and software for a multi-user GIS
              resource.  Faculty in computer science are developing a course that can be used
              as an elective in computer science, engineering, or environmental science. 
              Modules, providing some exposure to this methodology, can be developed for
              other computer science, engineering, geology, or environmental science courses.
