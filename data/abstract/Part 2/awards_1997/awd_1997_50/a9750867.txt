Abstract    :
              The inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) is being used to
              support elemental analysis for undergraduate chemistry, geology, technology,
              and biology courses at James Madison University (JMU).  The instrumentation
              gives students from these disciplines experience with  a commonly used,
              state-of-the-art technique for trace metals analysis.  The ICP-MS will be the
              keystone instrument in laboratories for new course work in environmental
              chemistry and technology and will significantly improve laboratory work in
              analytical chemistry, geochemistry, and ecology classes.  It will also be used
              extensively for field and student research projects, especially summer research
              programs involving students from JMU and other institutions.      *
