Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750072  Joseph E. Peters    This action funds an NSF/Alfred
              P. Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997. 
              These  fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic
              evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the use of
              molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship
              supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring
              laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Dissecting  specific interactions between mobile DNA elements to  understand
              bacterial evolution."  Mobile DNA elements such  as transposons and plasmids
              increase genetic diversity in  bacterial populations.  The molecular mechanism
              by which the  bacterial transposon Tn7 specifically targets its insertion  into
              plasmids able to move between cells is being  determined.  Understanding how
              mobile DNA elements recognize  and interact with each other will provide
              important insights  into how genetic information is rapidly spread through 
              bacterial populations.
