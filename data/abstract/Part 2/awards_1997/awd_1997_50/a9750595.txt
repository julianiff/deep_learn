Abstract    :
              The goal of the present proposal is to improve three undergraduate laboratory
              courses:  Terrestrial Community Ecology, Microbial Ecology and Experimental
              Biotechnology, offered by the Department of Biology at the University of Puerto
              Rico, Humacao Campus.  Central to the proposal is the acquisition of computers
              to be used in analyzing data obtained from field studies in the Terrestrial
              Community Ecology and Microbial Ecology labs, and from protein and nucleic acid
              experimental manipulations in the Experimental Biotechnology course, and thus,
              will provide students with a modern experimental approach to the study of three
              very fundamental areas in Biology.  The University of Puerto Rico is providing
              an amount twice as much as the award.
