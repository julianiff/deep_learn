Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750218  Anne M. Bronikowski    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Evolution of  temperature
              adaptation by natural bacterial populations in a  reptile host."   Repeated
              thermal niche evolution in the gut  bacteria Salmonella is being tested within
              a reptile host,  the slider turtle, that exhibits variable body temperatures 
              across seasons and spatial scales.  It is to be determined  if Salmonella are
              thermal generalists or specialists.  The  studies will focus on the mechanisms
              of thermal  specialization and how ambient temperatures affect bacterial 
              fitness within the host.
