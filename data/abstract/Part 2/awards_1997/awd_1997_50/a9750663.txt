Abstract    :
              This project is providing equipment for a studio classroom for statistics
              instruction.  The studio format is replacing the traditional lecture delivery
              method for introductory statistics courses by allowing the integration of
              multimedia instruction, student-centered activities, and computer simulations. 
              The design of the studio fosters student instructor interaction, student
              student interactions, team projects, and small group activities.  The project
              is benefitting approximately 1,500 students per year.  *
