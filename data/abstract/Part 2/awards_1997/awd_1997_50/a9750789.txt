Abstract    :
              This project is enhancing the high-performance parallel processing laboratory
              through the addition of an SGI Origin 2000 four-processor machine.  The
              department has grown tremendously in its experience, expertise, and curriculm
              concerning parallel processing in the past 4 years, and this new machine is
              allowing it to develop further, giving students access to state-of-the-art
              hardware and enabling them to conduct experiments and run the type of
              simulations that have previously been impossible.
