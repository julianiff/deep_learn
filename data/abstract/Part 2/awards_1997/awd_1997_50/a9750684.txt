Abstract    :
              Fourier-transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR) spectroscopy is a
              powerful, state-of-the-art analytical method used commonly in industrial and
              graduate school settings.  This project integrates modern FT-NMR concepts more
              firmly into the chemistry curriculum.  An upgrade of an outdated,
              continuous-wave 60-MHz instrument to an FT system allows full implementation of
              the project.  This upgrade dramatically increases the utility of magnets
              without introducing the high maintenance and purchasing costs associated with a
              superconducting NMR magnet.  The upgraded system provides the capability to (1)
              provide hands-on NMR experience as early as the sophomore year, (2) introduce
              13C NMR spectroscopy, (3) perform new laboratory experiments (e.g., experiments
              in kinetics and characterization of reactive intermediates), (4) investigate
              advanced NMR topics (such as FID collection, two-dimensional spectra,
              relaxation times, and signal-averaging) and (5) perform a host of other new
              applications.  Specific improvements in five laboratory-based chemistry courses
              begin with sophomore-level organic chemistry and continue through senior-level
              advanced courses.  Students graduate with extensive first-hand experience on an
              FT-NMR instrument, a thorough knowledge of the principles behind NMR, and
              confidence in spectral interpretation.  A comprehensive evaluation plan has
              been forged which relies on assessment of student performance on laboratory
              reports, course exams, and nationally standardized NMR-related test questions.
