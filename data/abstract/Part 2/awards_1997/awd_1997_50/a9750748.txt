Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to improve the laboratory curriculum in
              lower-level biology and chemistry courses by introducing computer-assisted
              spectrophotometers into the laboratories.  The courses affected by this project
              serve mainly non-science-majors, many of whom eventually major in education. 
              The ease of use and speed of the computer-assisted spectrophotometers allow
              their introduction into the larger, lower-level classes, while the number of
              variables that can be investigated with this equipment opens up the possibility
              of doing more complex laboratory experiments.  Exposure of non-science-majors,
              especially those entering the teaching workforce, to computer-assisted
              technology can make them feel more comfortable with the science and the
              technology of this field.  This can only improve their attitude toward science
              and the impression they give to their future students.
