Abstract    :
              We are introducing scanning probe microscopy (SPM) into the physics curriculum
              in order to update our modern physics capabilities.  We are taking a
              three-pronged approach:  1)  Bench-Top Experiments for freshmen in order to
              introduce key methods and concepts of both atomic force and scanning tunneling
              microscopy at the earliest possible opportunity.  2) "Standard Experiments"
              using Park Instruments Scanning Probe Microscope in the improved modern physics
              laboratory.  These experiments would include scans of gratings for
              standardization, scans of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), and scans
              of thin films deposited on a substrate.  While these are called "standard
              experiments," they represent some of the most innovative, exciting, and newest
              techniques in modern physics.  3)  Senior Thesis/Collaboration with Purdue
              University and Armco Research.  Majors in Biology, Chemistry and Physics will
              have this SPM available for projects.    The Park Instruments SPM was selected
              for acquisition because of its mid-range cost, modular construction and
              Windows-based software.    Instruction in the key concepts of scanning, actual
              work with a scanning probe microscope, and senior thesis research are helping
              to prepare our students for future work in graduate research laboratories and
              high technology industries.  The SPM is our next logical step for the
              improvement of our modern physics laboratory.  *
