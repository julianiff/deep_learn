Abstract    :
              Following a year-long, comprehensive review of the curriculum in 1993, the
              Chemistry Department faculty assembled a 5-year development plan.  The most
              significant proposed curricular change derives from the perceived need to
              develop a new approach to laboratory work for third-year chemistry majors. 
              This laboratory replaces traditional laboratories for our Physical, Advanced
              Inorganic, and Advanced Analytical Chemistry courses and uses an
              interdisciplinary, integrative approach to scientific problem-solving.  The
              Unified Laboratory, to be titled Advanced Techniques in Experimental Chemistry
              (ATEC) course contains truly integrated laboratories, not just a collection of
              experiments from didferent subdisciplines.  As the final major instrumental
              acquisition for ATEC, the Department of Chemistry is purchasing a tunable laser
              system and associated components for spectroscopic and kinetic measurements. 
              Acquisition of this highly flexible system allows faculty to give students
              solid experience in the extremely important area of laser spectroscopy.    *
