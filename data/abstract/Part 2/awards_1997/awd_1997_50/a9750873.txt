Abstract    :
              We are adding several new experiments to the UC Berkeley Physics 111 Laboratory
              in an effort to expose students in this upper-division  classroom lab to modern
              developments in science.  Earlier, the 111 Lab allowed students to experience
              elaborate experiments in Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; however, these
              experiments represent "state-of-the-art" science as of 30 years ago.  We are
              introducing new experiments, including Nonlinear Laser Spectroscopy and
              Magneto-optics, that will enhance the curriculum by bringing it up to date with
              modern developments in these fields.  The  111 Lab offers students a formative
              experience in experimental science, and the addition of these new experiments
              constitutes a vital step in improving the undergraduate physics curriculum. 
              These improvements are an extension of curriculum development efforts taking
              place in our lower division courses.  The resulting work will be made available
              to the physics community through journal articles, meetings via the World Wide
              Web, and a planned summer institute program.  *
