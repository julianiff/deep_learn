Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750147  Brian Nowak-Thompson    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Environmental  and genetic
              regulation of penicillin biosynthesis in  Aspergillus."  Ambient pH is a
              dominant environmental factor  affecting the transcriptional regulation of
              ipnA, a key  penicillin biosynthetic gene within Aspergillus nidulans.  Under
              acid conditions, however, available carbon sources  strongly influence ipnA
              expression through a mechanism  independent of creA-mediated carbon catabolite
              repression.  The goals of this study are to identify and characterize  carbon
              regulatory loci affecting ipnA expression,  characterize regulatory elements
              within the ipnA promoter  region required for carbon regulation, and examine
              the  relationship of ipnA promoter regions controlling carbon and  pH
              regulation.
