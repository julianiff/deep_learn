Abstract    :
              In order to modernize the laboratory curriculum, gas chromatography-mass
              spectroscopy (GC-MS) is being introduced into several chemistry labs.  The
              principles of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry have been taught in
              organic and analytical chemistry courses, but experience with a GC-MS
              instrument is introducing students to this technique and expanding and
              complementing other spectroscopic methods of structure determination including
              UV/vis, infrared and NMR used in organic chemistry laboratories.  In
              instrumental analysis labs in the analytical chemistry course, GC-MS is
              providing students with a method for quantitative and definitive analysis of
              complex mixtures. GC-MS is being introduced into the first-year general college
              chemistry course where it is being used to demonstrate the existence of
              isotopes and determine natural abundance of chemical elements. Experiments are
              being developed to take advantage of the unique power of GC-MS to both separate
              and identify mixtures of chemical compounds.  All students in organic,
              analytical and general chemistry (300400 per year) are benefiting from this
              project.  Students in the chemical technology program especially need profit
              from this experience with GC-MS, an analytical technique that is widely used
              and in demand by local industries and laboratories. This project helps prepare
              students for employment and meets the needs of local employers for this
              critical skill.   *
