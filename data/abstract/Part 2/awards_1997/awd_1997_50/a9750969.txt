Abstract    :
              An understanding of transient intermediates, such as radicals, ion radicals, and
              carbenes, is vital for a thorough understanding of reactions and reaction
              mechanisms in physical, organic, and biochemistry.  The ability to study these
              short-lived intermediate by laser transient absorption spectroscopy allows for
              a greater understanding of these important species.  This project provides a
              solid state Nd:YAG-pumped OPO laser system and the necessary equipment to set
              up a transient absorption system.  The equipment can be used in the
              undergraduate advanced organic and physical chemistry laboratories to
              familiarize the students with modern laser technology and to generate,
              characterize, and study transient species.  In addition to transient absorption
              measurements, the laser system can be used to generate steady-state populations
              of transient species for study by EPR spectroscopy.  *
