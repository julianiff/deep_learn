Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750250  Janet M. Fischer    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Effects of  ecological history
              on zooplankton community responses to  fish predation."  The effect of
              historical legacies on  community dynamics are poorly-understood.  Ecological 
              history may play a critical role in the dynamics of  freshwater zooplankton
              communities because a live sample of  past communities is stored in lake
              sediments as diapausing  eggs which remain viable for decades.  Zooplankton
              community  responses to fish predation is being contrasted in  experimental
              ponds which have historically contained or  lacked fish.
