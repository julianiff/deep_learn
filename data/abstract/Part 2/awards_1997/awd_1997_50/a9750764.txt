Abstract    :
              A highly innovative polymer laboratory class is created to accompany an
              increasingly popular interdisciplinary polymer science lecture class. 
              Carefully considered and selected state-of-the-art instrumentation is acquired
              and used in conjunction with "just in time" learning under the premise of the
              student's being faced with realistic industrial situations whereby specific
              technical questions have to be addressed within a limited period of time.  Five
              separate experiments emphasizing and reinforcing the material presented in
              lecture are performed.  The laboratory class is team taught by one faculty
              member from Chemical Engineering and one from the Chemistry Department; heavy
              contact hours between the student and these faculty in an intimate laboratory
              setting are an indispensable part of the course.  *
