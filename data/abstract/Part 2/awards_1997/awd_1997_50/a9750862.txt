Abstract    :
              A major problem with introductory science courses is that students are often
              turned off by the experience.  This failure to capture the interest and
              stimulate learning is partly related to the one-way communication style of
              lectures and the isolation of laboratories from the content of the course. 
              These factors contribute to a weak development of intellectual skills and
              understanding of the content.  The department is addressing these problems by
              integrating the lecture and laboratory portions of the introductory psychology
              course.  Students are actively exploring concepts, experimental procedures, and
              simulations using multimedia computers.  Students are also conducting
              experiments using computers interfaced with physiological recording equipment. 
              This approach is benefitting students majoring in psychology, psychobiology,
              education, and a broad range of non-science areas.  The methods of this course
              should encourage students to consider scientific careers.  *
