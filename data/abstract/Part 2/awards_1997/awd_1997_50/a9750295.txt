Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750295  Carol Goodwillie    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Genetic basis  of floral traits
              associated with mating system divergence."  Knowledge of the genetic basis of
              adaptation is central to  understanding evolutionary processes.  Floral traits 
              associated with mating systems are prominent adaptations of  higher plants. 
              DNA marker-based genome mapping techniques  are being used to investigate the
              number and magnitude of  loci controlling floral traits distinguishing 2
              species of  Linanthus that have diverged in mating systems.
