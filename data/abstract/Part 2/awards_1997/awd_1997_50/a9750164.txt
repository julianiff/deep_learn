Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750164  Preston R. Aldrich    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Dispersal,  area and edge
              effects, and the fragmentation of Amazonian  tree populations."  This study
              examines the effects of  forest fragmentation on tree populations in Brazil. 
              Adults  and seedlings are being mapped and tissue collected from 
              different-sized patches.  Microsatellite markers are being  used to reconstruct
              parentage relations and assess the  effect of patch area and edge on pollen and
              seed dispersal  and effective population size.  Valuable information is  being
              gained on the ecology of species interactions in  heterogeneous environments
              with important implications for  conservation theory and the design of nature
              reserves.
