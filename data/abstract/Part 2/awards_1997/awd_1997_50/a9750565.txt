Abstract    :
              This project is developing a curriculum for the introductory cellular and
              molecular biology course for majors in biological sciences, as well as
              integrating computers and promoting computer literacy.  Computers are providing
              a common design thread for the laboratory exercises, allowing students to use
              spreadsheets for data analyses, conduct multimedia simulations, search
              databases, access World Wide Web resources, and collect and analyze data for
              these experiments.  A computer laboratory of 13 workstations is allowing for
              the modernization of the laboratory experiments and providing a
              research-oriented environment that enhances learning of biology and stimulates
              students to remain in this field.  Key laboratory equipment is being purchased
              to allow computer acquisition of data in molecular biology, energy metabolism,
              and microscope imaging experiments.  This course is serving as a model for
              other large introductory cell biology courses for majors.  *
