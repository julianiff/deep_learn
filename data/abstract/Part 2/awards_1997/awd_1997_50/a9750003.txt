Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750003  Wes Burrows    This action funds an NSF/Alfred P.
              Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997.  These
               fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic
              evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the use of
              molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship
              supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring
              laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "DNA Sequence  variation of the Y chromosome in Great Apes:  molecular 
              evolution and natural selection of the male specific  chromosome." This
              research plan focuses on the Y chromosome  of the primates most closely related
              to humans:  chimpanzee,  gorillas, and orangutans.  The molecular evolution of
              the  "male" chromosome has become important and controversial in  population
              and phylogenetic analyses of primates.  Sequencing and PCR amplification of
              variable repeats of  DNA  are being used to assess the variation of the Y
              chromosome  between and within the great ape species.  Evidence is being 
              sought for natural selection on the Y chromosome in this  group of animals.
