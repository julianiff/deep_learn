Abstract    :
              The focus of this project is an emphasis on exploration and discovery of
              mathematical concepts by student teams through a constructivist approach. In
              developing this project, the personnel are reviewing laboratory configurations
              which have proven to be conducive to group work.  Desired is a layout which
              would allow instructors increased flexibility in designing curricula and
              promoting student group interactions.    *
