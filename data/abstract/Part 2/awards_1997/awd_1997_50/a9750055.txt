Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750055  Belinda Chang    This action funds an NSF/Alfred P.
              Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997.  These
               fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic
              evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the use of
              molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship
              supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring
              laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled 
              "Reconstructing ancestral pigment proteins in vitro to  investigate the
              molecular evolution of wavelength  sensitivity." Visual pigments called opsins
              are components  in vision and display a wide range of wavelength 
              sensitivities.  The evolution of vertebrate cone visual  pigments is being
              studied by constructing a phylogeny,  expressing artificially synthesized genes
              in vitro, and  measuring absorption spectra of the resulting opsins.  Knowledge
              gained on the evolutionary history of opsin  wavelength sensitivity will be
              used to assess hypotheses  concerning the biochemical mechanisms of shifts in 
              wavelength sensitivity.
