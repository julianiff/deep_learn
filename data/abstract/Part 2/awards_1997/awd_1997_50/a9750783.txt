Abstract    :
              The University of Oregon's Institute of Marine Biology has a well recognized
              program for undergraduates.  Courses are attended by students from both the
              University of Oregon and from institutions throughout the nation.  We offer
              students intense field oriented courses with closely correlated laboratories
              that cover a variety of marine science disciplines.    The problem addressed in
              this proposal relates primarily to our course, adaptations to the marine
              environment.  This course should provide students with opportunities to pose
              researchable questions using modern technology and equipment.  We do not have
              the appropriate equipment  for students to use molecular approaches to
              contemporary biological questions, and our physiology equipment is techniques
              in research by the PI, along with her background in invertebrate zoology,
              biochemistry and physiology, have allowed her to plan laboratory exercises
              giving students the opportunity to integrate cellular biology and organismal
              biology.    With this proposal we seek funding for equipment to implement these
              laboratory exercises .  Students will compare developmental changes in
              respiratory protein expression, ion regulation and metabolism in marine
              organisms they collect from nearby estuarine and coastal habitats.  They will
              process their experimental data and obtain a better understanding "from
              molecules to mudflats" of how organisms work.
