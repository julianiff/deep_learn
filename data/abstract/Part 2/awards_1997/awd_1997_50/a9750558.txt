Abstract    :
              This project addresses the difficulty of college students in handling the
              traditional courses in college algebra and preparatory algebra.  These courses
              stress symbolic manipulation and contrived problems.  Students find the courses
              to have little or no relevance to their background and goals.  The project is
              designed to achieve several major objectives through the integration of
              technology, including (1) reducing the need for paper and pencil manipulation;
              and (2) enabling the student to consider real-world problems drawn from the
              sciences, the social sciences, and economics.  The students are working in
              pairs on computer-based laboratory projects to analyze real data obtained
              locally or on the World Wide Web.  They are using an algebra and graphing
              package to assist them in difficult computations.  The project is predominately
              affecting non-science-majors and non-business-majors who want to take college
              algebra to fulfill a university requirement.  Such students tend to be bright,
              but deficient in basic algebraic skills.  *
