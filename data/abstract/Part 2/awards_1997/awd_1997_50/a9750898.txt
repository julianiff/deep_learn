Abstract    :
              The microbiology curriculum in the biology department needs to be updated to
              provide students with the background to assimilate into an increasingly
              scientific and technological society.  The two areas of microbiology that need
              the most improvement are microbial physiology and biotechnology.  A high-speed
              centrifuge, high-pressure liquid chromatography system and fermentation system
              are provided by this project to implement a course in microbial biotechnology
              and improve an existing course in bacterial metabolism.  The equipment is also
              used in existing biology core courses, microbiology and cell biology.  The
              goals of this project are to strengthen the microbiology laboratory curriculum,
              improve the students' learning experiences in this area, aid in the recruitment
              of undergraduates to these underrepresented areas in microbiology through more
              attractive courses, and promote undergraduate interest in these areas by
              presenting a more realistic laboratory environment.  The main learning
              objectives that can be accomplished through the purchase of this equipment are
              that students learn extensively about growth of bacteria from a basic as well
              as applied research approach and that students be exposed to and learn to
              operate some computer-based analytical equipment.
