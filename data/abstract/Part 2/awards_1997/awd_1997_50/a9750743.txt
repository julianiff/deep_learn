Abstract    :
              This project integrates design and manufacturing techniques in senior-level
              engineering and engineering technology courses.  The project's objective is to
              build an integrated design/manufacturing laboratory using industrial quality
              equipment so the students experience the complete product cycle from product
              inception through recycling the used product.  Topics covered by the courses
              using the new equipment include product inception based on customer needs;
              design requirements including function, service, and recycling issues; advanced
              product design using parametric solid modelers; building design models with a
              rapid prototyping system; using the models to refine the design; advanced
              manufacturing using computer numerical control machine tools and computer-aided
              programming systems; process control with modern coordinate measuring machines;
              and material reclamation systems when the product reaches the end of its useful
              life.  These topics are covered by having the students operate in teams to
              design and produce a real product.  New equipment includes a rapid prototyping
              machine with computer control and a CNC milling machine with tooling.  The
              equipment is shared between an Engineering and an Engineering Technology
              Department.  The new laboratory advances knowledge of the interaction between
              all phases of a product, from inception through re-use.  *
