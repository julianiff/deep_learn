Abstract    :
              

This project is developing an undergraduate physiology or neurosciences
              program. Undergraduates are being provided with training in the neurosciences
              and physiology that is has previously been unavailable due to lack of
              appropriate instrumentation. Productive research in neurosciences (and animal
              physiology) requires extensive technical skills and background. Many
              undergraduates lack the training to even be considered for undergraduate
              research or participation in summer research and training programs in the
              neurosciences. Therefore, the project is building three neurosciences
              workstations and incorporating four neurophysiological exercises into a
              junior-level course in animal physiology. This plan compliments and improves
              the course emphasis on neurosciences while enhancing the student skills
              necessary for advanced study and research. The new instrumentation is
              stimulating undergraduate research in the neurosciences and physiology. In
              addition, the project prepares students for productive summer enrichment
              programs in the neurosciences and increases interest in graduate careers in the
              neurosciences and animal physiology.
