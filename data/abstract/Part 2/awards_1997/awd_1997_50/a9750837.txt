Abstract    :
              This project is directed at two goals.  First, an experiment involving catalytic
              isomerization of n-butenes is built and introduced into the two required senior
              chemical engineering laboratory courses.  The experiment is based on an
              existing gas chromatograph and involves a relatively simple apparatus built
              around a tubular glass reactor packed with chromia alumina catalyst.  Purchased
              equipment includes an FID detector and second inlet for the chromatograph, a
              capillary column capable of separating the three n-butene isomers, and a tube
              furnace.  The students become familiar with the essentials of heterogeneous
              catalysis and see how kinetic and equilibrium data for catalytic reactions are
              generated and analyzed.    Second, an existing experiment involving the
              dynamics and control of a multivessel flow system is interfaced to the
              Internet.   This setup allows students (using Web software such as Netscape
              Navigator) in several nonlaboratory courses (including a first-year elective
              open to all engineering students) to see, run, and acquire data from this
              system.  Equipment includes a color video camera, motorized lens, tilt and pan
              stage for the camera, video compression card, and Pentium computer.  *
