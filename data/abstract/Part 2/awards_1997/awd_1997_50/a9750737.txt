Abstract    :
              The electrical engineering curriculum is experiencing a major restructuring that
              requires additional control laboratory experiments.  For undergraduate students
              emphasizing controls, the university must provide a well-rounded education in
              the theory and practice of control systems design in the areas of manufacturing
              automation and classical control systems design.  In addition, a manufacturing
              automation course must be provided for electrical engineering students not
              specializing in control and for the new Manufacturing Engineering program.   
              The new equipment provides equipment for a new classical control systems design
              laboratory.  This project provides additional equipment for the factory
              automation laboratory, which can see an increased number of students under the
              new curriculum.  The innovative aspects of this project are a desktop version
              of a manufacturing process used in undergraduate control education;
              introduction of IEC 1 131-3 standard PLC programming languages to
              undergraduates; and small-scale robust processes that expose students to the
              challenges of control design in the context of real industry applications.  *
