Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750196  Shannon Stahl    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Studies of  methane
              monooxygenase, an enzyme important for oil spill  cleanup and greenhouse gas
              depletion."  Methane  monooxygenase (MMO) catalyzes the aerobic oxidation of 
              methane to methanol and has important implications for  environmental issues
              ranging from global warming to  bioremediation.  This research examines the
              mechanism of  dioxygen activation and substrate oxidation by MMO using  various
              methods ranging from kinetic isotope effect studies  to site-directed
              mutagenesis.
