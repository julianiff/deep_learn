Abstract    :
              The department is developing a networked scanning probe microscope (SPM) core
              facility to serve students and faculty throughout the state. Access for
              students from large introductory laboratories is being provided through a
              computer workstation facility. Students from smaller advanced classes, and
              other campuses, can access the SPM directly through onsite visitations. Remote
              access is being provided through the existing Integrated Services Digital
              Network and can also be provided through a new broad bandwidth network.    On
              campus, the new facility is anchoring general and advanced microscopy courses,
              supporting interdisaiplinary science instruction in introductory and advanced
              science laboratories, and facilitating interdisciplinary research projects. The
              campus is acting as a hub for SPM activity and as a gateway to other
              remote-access core microscopy facilities being developed. Specially developed
              mini-courses (e.g., nanotechnology or cell biology), using SPM technology, are
              being provided for science teachers on a regular basis.
