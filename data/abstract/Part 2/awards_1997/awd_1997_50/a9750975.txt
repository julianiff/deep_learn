Abstract    :
              An applied physics instrumentation laboratory is being assembled to introduce
              students to modern techniques of computer interfacing using LabVIEW.  LabVIEW,
              a graphical programming language produced by National Instruments, is an
              application used widely in industry.  Based on past experiences, LabVIEW-based
              projects can provide very useful training for undergraduate physics majors. 
              Several students have obtained employment due to their LabVIEW training.
              LabVIEW-based instruction is bring fully integrated into the applied physics
              and engineering programs.  Students are learning the basics of interfacing
              using LabVIEW, and then undertaking individual projects based on real-world
              applications.
