Abstract    :
              Abstract  DBI 9750079  John Huelsenbeck    This action funds an NSF/Alfred P.
              Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997.  These
               fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic
              evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the use of
              molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship
              supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring
              laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Testing  Models of Cladogenesis in a Phylogenetic Context."  Phylogenetic
              trees (diagrams depicting the genealogical  relationships of species) can be
              used to examine the process  of speciation and extinction.  This research
              focuses on how  speciation and extinction rates can be estimated from 
              phylogenetic trees of living and fossil bivalves.
