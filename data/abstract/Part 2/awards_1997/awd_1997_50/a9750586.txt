Abstract    :
              This award equips a molecular modeling and computational facility that  enhance
              lectures, conferences, laboratories, and homework assignments throughout the
              undergraduate chemistry curriculum: General Chemistry (Accelerated), Organic
              Chemistry, Physical Chemistry (Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Chemistry),
              Inorganic/Physical Chemistry Laboratory, Advanced Mechanistic Organic
              Chemistry, and Advanced Inorganic Chemistry. In these courses, calculations are
              carried out at one or more levels-semi-empirical and ab initio-depending on the
              course and the complexity of the problem. In addition, the facility is used for
              several research projects, involving collaboration between undergraduate
              students and faculty who have theoretical components to their research.  *
