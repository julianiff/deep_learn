Abstract    :
              In recent years, the Biology Department has undergone considerable
              modernization, including the acquisition of new equipment for courses in
              cellular-molecular physiology.  Through this project,  a course is being
              established to enable undergraduates to study basic cellular and molecular
              processes in physiology using modern instrumentation.  As part of the class,
              students are performing a variety of critical experiments to help them
              understand how to approach problems in physiology using modern equipment. 
              After mastering the instrumentation through supervision, students are designing
              their own research projects based on a survey of the literature.  The final
              examination in the course is an oral presentation given to and evaluated by a
              group of peers.  In addition to technical knowledge, students who enroll in
              this class are developing skills in experimental design and hypothesis testing.
               The new equipment is being shared with physiology, development, and cell and
              molecular biology courses.  For students pursuing summer research
              opportunities, the equipment is being made available for their training prior
              to the experience.  It is enriching the curriculum in biomedical education for
              about 340 students.  *
