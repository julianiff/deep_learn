Abstract    :
                This project is motivated by the need in the mathematics program for a single
              focus that can direct mathematics majors' learning throughout their
              undergraduate education and ultimately prepare them to be independent and
              life-long learners.  As a capstone experience, the previous senior seminar has
              been intended to display this independence by having students pull together 3
              years of instruction into a single presentation.  Unfortunately students have
              not been prepared to meet this challenge.  This project has therefore chosen as
              its organizing principle the need to improve undergraduate research
              capabilities at every stage of the program.  This project improves students'
              research experiences by improving mastery of mathematical content, creating
              opportunities to complete extended assignments and self-directed inquiry, and
              providing modern technological capabilities that facilitate creative
              investigations.    This project identifies courses for which extended
              assignments and projects are used, creates assignments and projects that are
              stimulating and relevant to course objectives, increases the expectations for
              student accomplishment as they advance through the program, and tracks
              students' progress according to projects completed and mastery levels reached
              at each stage.  The benefits of this project are described in terms of student
              gains: (a) students learn that mathematics is a dynamic subject that is
              constantly changing and expanding; (b) students understand how mathematics is
              created and how mathematical research is conducted; and (c) by attending
              conferences and giving presentations of their work, students become connected
              to the greater mathematics community and gain greater appreciation for the
              beauty and elegance of mathematics.  *
