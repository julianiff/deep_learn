Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigator will redesign the undergraduate Physics laboratory
              curriculum at Cuyamaca College to increase the retention of underrepresented
              students (Native Americans, Blacks, Hispanics and women) in its Engineering
              Program.    The Principal Investigator will institute a combination of the
              nationally recognized microcomputer-based laboratory curriculum and incorporate
              modern instrumentation and laboratory equipment.  Specific curricular changes
              will be made in the areas of kinematics, dynamics and thermodynamics.    In
              conjunction with the redesigned curriculum, the Principal Investigator will
              implement learning communities into the Physics laboratory experience. 
              Advanced Engineering students will work with at-risk, underrepresented students
              to develop collaborative learning, teamwork and group problem-solving skills.
