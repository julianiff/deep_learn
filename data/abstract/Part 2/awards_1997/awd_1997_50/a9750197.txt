Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750197  Brendan Bohannan    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Bacterial  diversity and
              productivity of the environment."  Environmental productivity is known to
              strongly influence  plant and animal diversity.  The effect on bacterial 
              diversity, however, is poorly understood. The relationship  between
              environmental productivity and bacterial diversity  is being clarified by
              estimating the richness of  bacterial  species in natural ponds that vary in
              productivity.  Mathematical modeling of and further experiments in field 
              mesocosms and laboratory microcosms will be conducted to  assess the mechanisms
              determining diversity.
