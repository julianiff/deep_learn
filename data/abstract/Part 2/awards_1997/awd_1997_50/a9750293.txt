Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750293  Shanna E. Carney    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Hybrid  Speciation in a Young
              Population of  Wild Sunflowers."  The  study population is approximately 50
              years old and is  composed of  Helianthus annuus and H. bolanderi. 
              Meaasurements are being made of fertility, reproductive  isolation, and habitat
              associations of hybrids to determine  if hybrid speciation has occurred and by
              what mechanisms.
