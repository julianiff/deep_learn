Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750059  Kenneth R. Petren    This action funds an
              NSF/Alfred P. Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution
              for 1997.  These  fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, 
              comparative, computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological
              patterns and processes at the molecular level  within the framework of
              organismic evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the
              use of molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each
              fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a
              sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is
              entitled "Genetic  differentiation of hybridizing Darwin's finches."  Darwin's 
              finches are a model system for studying the interaction of  natural selection
              and hybridization and the process of  speciation.  This research uses highly
              variable genetic  markers, microsatellite loci, to verify parentage of 
              hybrids.  Long term effects of introgressive gene flow will  be determined by
              comparing populations and species on Daphne  Major and other islands of the
              Galapagos.
