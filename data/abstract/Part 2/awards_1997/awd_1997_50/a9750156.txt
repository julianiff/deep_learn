Abstract    :
              9703804  Armitage      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-  four months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a three-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Bruce A. Armitage to work with Dr. Peter E.
               Nielsen at the Panum Institute in Copenhagen, Denmark.    Dr. Armitage will
              study the interaction of peptide nucleic  acid (PNA) oligomers with RNA
              molecules.  His major  hypothesis is whether the interaction  of PNA with
              synthetic  ribozyme RNA will inhibit ribozyme self-splicing.  This work  will
              give increased understanding into the interaction of  PNA with folded RNA
              molecules, which are essential  components in the development of PNA as an
              antisense  therapeutic and diagnostic agent.    Dr. Nielsen is one of the
              inventors of PNA and therefore is  most experienced in the synthesis and
              application of these  molecules.  In addition, Nielsen's colleague, Dr. Henrik 
              Nielsen will contribute expertise in RNA and ribozymes.  Dr.  Armitage
              completes the collaboration with his experience in  quinone chemistry and
              photochemistry.  ***
