Abstract    :
              The problem to be remedied by this project is a deficiency in the curriculum
              with regard to nuclear-magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.  The objectives
              of the project are twofold.  First, the pedagogical method of instruction at
              the introductory level is improved for spectral characterization by NMR
              spectroscopy.  Second, at both the advanced and introductory levels, the
              curriculum is updated by teaching students how to obtain and interpret 1990's
              FT-NMR 1D and 2D data in lieu of 1960's CU-NMR.  A gradualistic style of
              spectroscopic instruction for introductory organic chemistry is employed. 
              Gradualistic learning is defined as a series of small steps that build one upon
              the other until such time as sufficient skill has been developed to solve
              complex problems.  This method for teaching spectroscopy to large numbers of
              students depends on the use of autosampling instrumentation and has been under
              development in this department for several years.  Upper-level chemistry and
              biochemistry majors manually operate the NMR and perform experiments that
              address the theoretical aspects of FT-NMR spectroscopy.  The new NMR
              significantly improves the quality of the undergraduate research opportunities
              for students.  Since 1991, 50 percent of graduating majors have been women,
              over 40 of whom have gone on to graduate studies.  This project therefore
              affects a large number of women who may enter into the scientific professions. 
              In addition to the development of many new experiments that fit into the
              framework of the traditional chemistry laboratory curriculum, this project also
              brings to fruition the gradualistic method of instruction, which can have a
              significant impact within the local institution and may have an effect on
              teaching at the regional or national level.    *
