Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750301  Lauren V. Riters    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled  "Neuroendorcrine control of
              seasonal singing in starlings."  For many birds, lengthening days lead to
              elevation of  testosterone levels and changes in the area of the brain 
              necessary for singing.  But birds also sing during  shortening days when the
              level of testosterone and the brain  regions required for song are unchanged. 
              This study uses  starlings to investigate how changes in day length modifies 
              the responsiveness of the brain to testosterone and how  environmental factors
              affect the brain to produce seasonally  relevant behavior.
