Abstract    :
              A GC-MS is being used for the enhancement of all organic laboratory instruction,
              both lower and upper division courses as well as the organic chemistry lab for
              non-majors. Specific experiments are proposed for each laboratory class that
              will afford the students the opportunity to become familiar with both the
              instrumentation and the data analysis.  *
