Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750065  Daniel A. Barbash    This action funds an
              NSF/Alfred P. Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution
              for 1997.  These  fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, 
              comparative, computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological
              patterns and processes at the molecular level  within the framework of
              organismic evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the
              use of molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each
              fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a
              sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is
              entitled "The genetic  and molecular basis of species formation in Drosophila."
               The goal of this research is to identify genes important for  speciation in
              the melanogaster species complex of the  fruitfly.  Small genomic regions are
              being crossed between  D. melanogaster and D. simulans by genetic intogression.
               Introgressed regions are being examined for effects on  hybrid sterility and
              viability, and the production of female  mating pheromones.  The feasibility of
              using these  introgressed lines for further behavioral studies is also  being
              assessed.
