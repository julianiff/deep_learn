Abstract    :
              The Department of Biology graduates an average of 75 students per year, 11 of
              whom are typically preservice teachers and 24 of whom are seeking careers in
              environmental biology.  Additionally, several inservice teachers enroll in
              summer field courses and environmental biology workshops.  The number of
              students in the environmental biology program has increased dramatically over
              the past several years, and the department is now deficient with respect to the
              number and variety of environmental courses offered and the equipment
              supporting these courses.  This project modernizes the environmental and
              ecological curriculum with a major infusion of investigative field and
              laboratory research into the course activities.  The major objective of the
              project is to equip the field station (TLES) with modern ecological and
              environmental biology equipment for undergraduate student use.  The TLES is a
              teaching and research facility, established with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
              Service, and located 3.2 km from the main campus.  The new equipment allows
              students to use a variety of modern ecological research techniques as they ask
              and answer important ecological questions.  Additionally, with an equipped
              field station so close to the main campus, the department can provide
              invaluable field experience for environmental biology students and preservice
              teachers as part of the regular curriculum.  Ultimately, the university
              produces better trained individuals for today's very competitive field of
              environmental biology and produces preservice teachers with better field
              training who may eventually transpire into more field activities in the high
              school biology curricula within the Inland Northwest.  Additionally, students
              gain more experience designing and conducting studies and analyzing and
              presenting their own data, which has similar beneficial impacts.  *
