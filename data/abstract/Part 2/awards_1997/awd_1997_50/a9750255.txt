Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750255  Gail Rocheleau    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Molecular  analysis of
              evolutionary and environmental relationships of  plant and animal viruses." 
              Amino acids and nucleotides  important for plant viral RNA-protein complex
              formation are  being identified using biochemical and genetic methods.  The 
              role of the environment in virus evolution is being assessed  by biochemical
              approaches that examine relationships between  two viruses in the Alphavirus
              superfamily and by  constructing an evolutionary tree.
