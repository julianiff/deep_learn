Abstract    :
              The initiation of changes in undergraduate education from a teacher-centered
              paradigm to a learner-centered one requires increased hands-on, exploratory,
              experiential activities.  This is especially true for spatial and cartographic
              learning.  This project is  supporting such activities in undergraduate
              geography education through the use of remote-sensing and analytical
              cartographic techniques.  The ENVISAGE project is accomplishing these goals by
              allowing students to experience and explore geographic processes in a
              semi-immersive, 3-D stereo visualization environment.  The Department of
              Geography has seen a large increase in the number of undergraduate majors (from
              30 to 140) during the past several years.  A recent initiative on geographic
              information systems (GIS) and geo-spatial technologies includes a new GIS
              instructional laboratory.  The ENVISAGE project is expanding on this initiative
              and allowing students to explore innovative approaches to environmental
              visualization and analysis in a classroom setting.  The ImmersaDesk systems
              allow interaction with 3-D stereo images by an instructor and small groups of
              students, bringing technology that has been effective in scientific research
              and industrial development into a learning environment.  ENVISAGE is
              contributing significant content to several core courses and providing a bridge
              from current GIS practice to understanding through immersion.  It is
              demonstrating the value of advanced technology for education through measurable
              changes in student learning, enrollment, and evaluations.  *
