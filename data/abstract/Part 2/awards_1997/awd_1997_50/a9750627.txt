Abstract    :
                Through this project, the Department of Bioengineering provides an
              undergraduate Biotechnology and Bioprocess Laboratory. This laboratory course
              teaches students the techniques and technologies used in the biotechnology and
              bioprocessing industries. The students also obtain an overview of the
              biotechnology industry. This course is unique in that it presents laboratory
              experiments in the context of gaining an understanding of how the techniques
              learned are used in industrial bioprocessing. Of particular significance is the
              incorporation of molecular biology techniques within a bioengineering
              laboratory.   *
