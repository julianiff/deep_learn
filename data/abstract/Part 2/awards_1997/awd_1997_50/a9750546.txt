Abstract    :
              An important goal in any advanced physics laboratory is for students, with
              minimal supervision, to design and implement an experimental scheme to study a
              physical phenomenon.  This project concerns a teaching strategy for the
              advanced laboratory that systematically develops experimental design skills.  A
              unique feature of this course is the requirement of students to write at least
              a small section of LabVIEW code for each laboratory experience directly
              pertaining to data acquisition or system control.  Since LabVIEW is icon
              oriented, students are able to progress from simple experimental design tasks
              to more complicated ones fairly quickly.  The department is purchasing
              computers, data acquisition and GPIB interface boards, and LabVIEW software.
              This project is enhancing the advanced laboratory course, which is
              significantly improving the experimental skills of physics majors.
