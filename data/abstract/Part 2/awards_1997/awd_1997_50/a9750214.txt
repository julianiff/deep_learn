Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750214  David Hooper    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Storage of  carbon in arctic
              tundra plants in response to climatic  change."  The research is investigates
              temperature as a  direct effect and nutrient availability as an indirect 
              effect on plant gross productivity.  Predictions of flux  measurements from 2
              models, GASFLUX and MBL/CSA, are being  compared for different arctic plant
              communities.  The  differences in these models will be exploited to better 
              understand how plant functional traits control the carbon  balance in the
              tundra ecosystem.
