Abstract    :
              The Department of Engineering has a modern undergraduate materials laboratory
              equipped with an image analysis system.  This system has been used to improve
              the capability of students to view and analyze microscopic structure.  However,
              it has been limited to traditional optical microscopes and two-dimensional
              (2-D) views on video monitors.  This project seeks to remove this limitation
              through the acquisition of an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) and Virtual i.O VGA
              glasses.  The AFM allows students to see views on the molecular arrangement
              level.  However, these views are still presented on a VGA monitor as a 2-D view
              of a three-dimensional (3-D) view.  The Virtual i.O VGA glasses correct this
              deficiency.  Through the use of special software, the normal static view from
              the AFM is turned into a virtual 3-D view.  Thus, the virtual image of the
              instructor is able to walk onto the object being viewed and point out the
              significant details.  Students, wearing the Virtual i.O VGA glasses, are able
              to roam about the virtual 3-D view of the object being studied.  Another
              objective is to improve the ability of students to understand 3-D
              visualizations and particularly 3-D object rotation.  Pre- and post-tests
              evaluate whether increased understanding has taken place.  *
