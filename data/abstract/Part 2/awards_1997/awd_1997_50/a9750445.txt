Abstract    :
              This project is instituting the broad application of GPS to the analytical and
              environmental tracks of the geography undergraduate programs, which serve
              majors and a large number of interdisciplinary students, particularly
              environmental studies students majoring in environmental planning.  The
              institution has focused on the development of a GPS component that links the
              geographic information systems (GlS) cartography, and air photography
              laboratories with the physical/environmental laboratory by revising specific
              coursework in these areas to include laboratory and field experiences.  The
              curriculum is being modified to incorporate GPS in a logical progression of
              courses that start with introductory cartography and GIS courses.  These
              courses are followed by the use of the new technology in several of the
              physical geographical courses that culminate in a capstone course in
              environmental planning and decisionmaking.  *
