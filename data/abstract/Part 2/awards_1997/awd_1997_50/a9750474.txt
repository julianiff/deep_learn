Abstract    :
              This program is updating introductory chemistry curricula by using modern
              instrumentation in undergraduate courses.  The updated curricula are enhancing
              the quality of introductory chemistry courses, improving the retention of
              science students, and easing the transition for community college students
              entering 4-year institutions.  Interactive instructional software that provides
              students and instructors with a "virtual"  Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR)
              instrument have already been developed.  Similar software for a virtual
              Fourier-transform nuclear-magnetic-resonance (FT-NMR) instrument is currently
              under development.  This software can be used by instructors as a lecture aid
              for introducing spectroscopic methods and as a tutorial for the use of the
              FT-IR and FT-NMR instruments. For actual laboratory courses, students can
              submit samples from their own experiments to regional centers for FT-IR and
              FT-NMR measurements.  Data from each sample are stored on an Internet file
              server for students to download locally.  This file server provides reasonable
              access to instrumentation, which many community colleges and private colleges
              typically do not have.  By providing students with experience with modern
              instrumentation and interpretation of their own experimental data, this program
              is enhancing their understanding of important chemical concepts.  In addition,
              students are gaining insight into the collaborative nature of this scientific
              process.  *
