Abstract    :
              The mathematics department oat College of DuPage proposes to establish two
              computer classrooms with eighteen computers in each room for the purposes of
              exploring the integration of computing technology into the mathematics
              curriculum.  fourteen additional copies of the software will be installed in an
              open lab for students to use when class is not in session.  The department has
              some technology for demonstration purposes, but limited technology for student
              use in the classroom.  The goal of the project team is to achieve the following
              six outcomes during the proposed two-year project:    Improve mathematics
              teaching and learning through the increased use of symbolic algebra and
              graphing technology;    Provide staff development workshops for secondary and
              postsecondary mathematics teachers and faculty, to be conducted by the team of
              project investigators, on the use of technology in the classroom;    Meet the
              recommendations of the Illinois Articulation Initiative of the Illinois Board
              of Higher Education to address the quantitative literacy needs of postsecondary
              students;  and    Meet the goals of curriculum reform set forth by the American
              Mathematical Association for two-year Colleges and the Mathematics Association
              of America;    To achieve these outcomes, mathematics faculty and students will
              engage in discovery learning to be led by classroom instructors.  Classes will
              be modeled to enable students to do mathematics as it is done in the workplace.
