Abstract    :
              Recent studies of students' conceptual knowledge of chemistry indicate that,
              even when they are able to use chemical formula and balance equations, they
              often fail to fully comprehend the underlying molecular reality.  To develop
              students' ability to think in molecular terms, this project introduces
              molecular modeling exercises in both the introductory and organic chemistry
              courses.  Introduction of molecular modeling exercises has been chosen as the
              next step in the college's 5-year plan to update and improve its chemistry
              curriculum because they have proven an effective way to present chemical
              structure information in the undergraduate curriculum at institutions to which
              many of the college's students transfer; they are readily adaptable to highly
              visual, computer-based instructional techniques that have proven effective in
              previous science curriculum projects; they introduce students to techniques
              that are now standard in many commercial chemistry laboratories, such as in the
              pharmaceuticals industry; they take advantage of the college's existing
              investment in instructional technology; and properly constructed, they provide
              free reign to a student's imagination and encourage creativity.  *
