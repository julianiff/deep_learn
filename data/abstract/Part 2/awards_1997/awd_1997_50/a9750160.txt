Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750160  Vladimir V. Pravoudov    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Social  environment and energy
              strategies in birds."  In the  temperate zone, many small birds must survive
              harsh winters  characterized by low ambient temperatures and reduced food 
              supplies.  It has been hypothesized that food-caching birds  use food-caches as
              an alternative to body fat storage,  allowing them to maintain lower body mass.
              Most food-caching  birds live in socially structured groups where dominants 
              have priority access to food.  This research investigates  the impact of the
              social environment on optimal fattening  and caching strategies in wintering
              caching birds. Both  empirical and stochastic dynamic game modeling approaches 
              are being used.
