Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750278  Caitlin Gabor    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Reproductive  character
              displacement on mate selectivity in live bearing  fish."  Reproductive
              character displacement (RCD) has been  proposed to play an integral role in the
              speciation process.  Studies to date suggest that the hypothesis has value but 
              all have been limited in one way or another.  This research  uses the bisexual
              sailfin mollie, Poecilia latipinna, and  the unisexual mollie, P. formosa, a
              hybrid with strict  maternal inheritance, to evaluate RCD on male mate 
              selectivity for conspecific females versus gynogenetic  females along a
              transect of allopatric and sympatric  populations.  Allozyme variation is being
              used to estimate  gene flow and its relationship to the spread of the male 
              discrimination trait.
