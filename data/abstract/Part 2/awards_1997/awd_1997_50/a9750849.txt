Abstract    :
              This project addreses a current dilemma in science education. The subject matter
              of physical chemistry is somewhat abstract.  Laboratory experiments
              demonstrating the results of models are essential to making lessons more
              concrete.  However, contemporary physical chemistry experiments, featuring the
              development of a molecular-level picture of interactions, often use very
              expensive equipment.  Faced with fiscal constraints, many institutions have
              been reluctant to invest in equipment.  The result is that physical chemistry
              laboratory courses tend not to reflect contemporary practices.  The project is
              developing a series of laboratory exercises focusing on molecular-level
              processes in two areas; materials surface chemistry and biochemistry.  A series
              of open-ended, inquiry-based laboratory exercises are enabling students to
              develop an image of consequences of models such as particle-in-the-box,
              spherical waves (the hydrogen atom), and bonding interactions.  *
