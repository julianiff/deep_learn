Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer
              (GC/MS) to improve the undergraduate chemistry laboratory program by
              incorporating mass spectrometry laboratory experiences within the existing
              framework of the laboratory courses.  The project operation requires the
              purchase of a benchtop GC/MS suitable for teaching, routine analysis, and
              senior research applications.  Increasingly complex laboratory utilization of
              the instrument is possible as the students progress from introductory organic
              chemistry to instrumental analysis and physical chemistry and finally to senior
              research applications.  These laboratory experiences complement and supplement
              the students past laboratory experiences which have been centered around an
              array of basic instrumentation and a few more sophisticated items.  These
              additional laboratory experiences better equip graduates to meet the challenges
              of industry and graduate programs.  *
