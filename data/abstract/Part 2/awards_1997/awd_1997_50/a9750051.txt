Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750051  Richard E. Broughton    This action funds an
              NSF/Alfred P. Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution
              for 1997.  These  fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, 
              comparative, computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological
              patterns and processes at the molecular level  within the framework of
              organismic evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the
              use of molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each
              fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a
              sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is
              entitled "Applying  multiple locus genealogies to molecular evolution and 
              species divergence."  The overall goal of the research is to  understand the
              origin and maintenance of genetic variation  in natural populations.  Gene
              genealogies are being  generated from five nuclear loci for three closely
              related  species of field crickets (genus Gryllus).  A series of  questions are
              being addressed.  How do gene trees from  different loci differ in structure
              and/or length?  What do  different gene phylogenies indicate about the relative
               effects of natural selection, recombination, population  subdivision, and
              population size fluctuation?  Did two  concurrently hybridizing species diverge
              while in continuous  contact, or in geographic isolation prior to assuming
              their  present distributions?
