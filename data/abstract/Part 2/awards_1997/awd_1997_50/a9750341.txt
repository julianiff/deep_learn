Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750341  Claire S. Ting    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Key  Environmental Factors
              Regulating Photosynthetic Gene  Expression in a Novel Prokaryote." 
              Prochlorococcus marinus  is the only photosynthetic prokaryote which has been
              found  to contain a chlorophyll a/b light-harvesting antenna as  well as the
              phycobiliprotein, phycoerythrin.  This research  addresses the functional
              significance of phycoerythrin in  this organism.  The mechanisms that regulate
              phycoerythrin  gene expression and accumulation are being determined under 
              different light and nutrient levels.
