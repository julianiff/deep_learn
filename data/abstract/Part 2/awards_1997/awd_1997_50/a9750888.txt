Abstract    :
              The equipment requested in this project will improve students' ability to
              interpret electron microscope images and to increase their understanding of
              cell and tissue ultrastructure.  This will be achieved through simultaneous
              viewing of electron microscope images projected or displayed on a TV monitor. 
              Viewing in teams or in small groups will also make possible increased
              collaborative learning among the students.  The project will thereby enhance
              the investigations experience of the students by allowing them to focus more on
              the research projects rather than on acquiring the interpretive skills.  Though
              the project will benefit primarily upper level undergraduate students, students
              in lower level biology classes will also benefit.    The equipment request is
              for a TV-adapter which can transfer transmission electron microscope images via
              a CCD camera to a high resolution monitor.  The images displayed on the monitor
              can then be viewed by several people simultaneously.
