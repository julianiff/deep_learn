Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750229  Kimberly L. Schulz    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Nutrient  inputs to lakes as
              determinants of the dominate herbivorous  animals in aquatic grazer
              communities."  Laboratory and  field mesocosm experiments on lake zooplankton
              communities  are being conducted to determine how herbivore communities  are
              structured by nutrient loading, how well the mechanisms  of 3 major hypotheses
              predict zooplankton community  composition, and the feedbacks to the ecosystem
              of nutrient  recycling by zooplankton communities under differing loading 
              conditions.
