Abstract    :
              As a result of rapid developments in the spectroscopic analytical and chemical
              separations fields, the focus of this department has been directed to
              instrumental techniques in the physical, biological, and analytical chemistry
              curricula.  The project involves the addition of modern instrumentation in gas
              chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography (analytical and
              prep-scale), mass spectrometry, ultraviolet/visible, fluorescence,
              Fourier-transform infrared, and Fourier-transform nuclear-magnetic resonance
              spectroscopies to the curriculum.  The department is now seeking to address the
              need for instruction in electrochemical methods to combat a lack of student
              understanding of basic ideas in solution chemistry and interfacial
              measurements.  This project is implementing a systematic program of
              electrochemical education that provides for (1) hands-on student exposure to
              modern electrochemical methods and equipment; (2) demonstration of the
              competitiveness of electrochemical methods with other techniques; (3) the
              development of new undergraduate laboratory exercises; and (4) the exposure of
              the modern methods and equipment to increased numbers of students in the areas
              of analytical, inorganic, physical, polymer, and biochemistry.  These
              experiments illustrate important chemical concepts and serve to demonstrate the
              use of electrochemistry in analysis.
