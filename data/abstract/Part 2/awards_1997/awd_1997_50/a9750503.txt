Abstract    :
              This project is modernizing the biology curriculum by introducing inquiry-based
              instructional methods into the laboratories. By purchasing scientific and
              computing equipment, the department is integrating computer-interfaced
              equipment into its biology laboratories.    This process enables the department
              to (1) provide students with current technology by introducing inquiry-based
              labs that include practical experience in computational data acquisition and
              analysis, (2) provide students with similar laboratory experiences to those
              conducted at 4-year colleges and universities, (3) improve the technical
              literacy of students entering the workforce, and (4) provide students with
              opportunities to design experiments that illustrate theory.    As a result of
              curriculum changes in general biology, anatomy and physiology, and
              microbiology, about 740 undergraduate students a year are able to design
              experiments and manipulate variables, creating an opportunity to observe the
              relationships between theory and practice. In addition, they are studying
              biology as practiced by professional biologists. This process is helping
              students to make the transition more successfully when they transfer to 4-year
              institutions or enter the workforce.  *
