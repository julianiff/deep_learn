Abstract    :
              This project works to develop case study teaching in the sciences.  Although
              case study instruction is standard practice in business, law, and medicine, it
              is not common in science. Yet the use of case studies holds great promise as a
              pedagogical technique for teaching science to undergraduates because it
              humanizes science and illustrates well scientific methodology and values.  
              This project involves faculty in a five-day workshop instructing them how to
              teach with cases, how to develop cases, and how to access a large body of
              existing case studies.  Undergraduate students work with the program critiquing
              faculty instruction and the case study method.  Developed case studies will be
              placed and maintained on a Web site which, in turn, also serves as a national
              clearinghouse and repository for cases.
