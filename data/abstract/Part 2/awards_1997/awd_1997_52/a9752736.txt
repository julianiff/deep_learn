Abstract    :
              Mathematics faculty in New York State have formed the New York State Coalition
              to integrate the teaching and learning of mathematics and its applications in
              science and quantitative subjects.  The project will enable the coalition to:
              modify for local implementation curricular materials and approaches being
              developed nationally; demonstrate how faculty in mathematics and science can
              cooperate to develop interdisciplinary courses; continue to attract and retain
              students from underrepresented groups; and spur interdisciplinary innovations
              at participating institutions.  The project includes workshops and follow-up
              activities.
