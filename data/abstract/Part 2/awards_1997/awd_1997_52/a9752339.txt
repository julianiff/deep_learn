Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to start the process of enhancing the
              quantitative components of many undergraduate life science courses by focusing
              on the general biology sequence taken by science students.  The proposed
              efforts will illustrate to students the importance of a diversity of
              quantitative tools to analyze life science problems, emphasize the utility of
              quantitative methods across the spectrum of life sciences, serve to reduce the
              perception by students that math is only needed for math courses, and enhance
              students appreciation for the importance of theory in the scientific process. 
              The objectives will be met through development of appropriate quantitative
              examples, based upon data and illustrating key biological concepts, for
              entry-level biology courses.  Dissemination of results will proceed through
              publication of a Primer of Quantitative Biology and a variety of web-based
              products.  The project will also develop assessment tools to aid faculty in
              determining the level of quantitative competency of life science students,
              particularly in topic areas critical to the life sciences.
