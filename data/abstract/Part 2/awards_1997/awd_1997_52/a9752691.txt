Abstract    :
              Standards-based reform curricula are making serious inroads in the high school
              classroom. These curricula are truly different in significant ways. The
              content, pedagogy, technology, and assessment of these new programs bear little
              resemblance to those of only a few short years ago.  Currently, colleges and
              universities are graduating and certifying students to teach mathematics at the
              secondary level who are not prepared to deal with the new texts and courses.
              This guarantees that even new teachers from undergraduate and graduate programs
              have to be retrained if their schools adopt one of the new reformed curricula. 
                This project is developing, field-testing, and publishing a text for a
              modeling course which is intended both for majors and for future secondary
              school teachers of mathematics which mirrors and models courses that future
              teachers will experience in the high school classroom.  The course emphasizes
              both how to mathematize the problem and how to select the mathematics to use. 
              It also makes frequent use of technology, group and inquiry based learning, and
              alternative assessments.
