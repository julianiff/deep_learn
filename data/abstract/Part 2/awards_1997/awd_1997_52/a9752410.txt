Abstract    :
               The National Research Council advocates active science learning, stating that
              "Learning science is something students do, not something that is done to
              them.... Emphasizing active science learning means shifting emphasis away from
              teachers presenting information...." The goal of this proposal is to publish a
              guidebook and video for teachers who wish to implement innovative  teaching
              methods to make science learning an active process in introductory geoscience,
              Earth systems, and geology courses.    The teacher's guide and video will be
              based on the method of peer learning developed for introductory physics by Dr.
              Eric Mazur at Harvard (Mazur, 1997). In essence, the teacher presents a small
              amount of information, then poses a challenging conceptual question for the
              students to answer. Students try to convince their peers that their own answers
              are correct, hence the phrase peer learning. In the process, students construct
              explanations and communicate their ideas to others, making the classroom
              science experience an active one, yet providing a sense of routine and
              structure that is meaningful and fun for students.    Teachers will be able to
              draw upon the extensive collection of class-tested, ready-to-use peer learning
              materials compiled in the teacher's guide. The video, produced with AudioVisual
              Instructional Services at Franklin and Marshall College, will consist of visual
              examples of how one can enact this peer learning approach. Because many of the
              concepts taught in the geosciences are so visually accessible, peer learning
              will is combined with in-class demonstrations. These demonstrations also will
              be shown in the video.
