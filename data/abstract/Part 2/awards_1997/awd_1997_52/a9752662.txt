Abstract    :
              Our Project addresses the challenges of transfer student recruitment and
              retention in the Applied Environmental Sciences program at Oregon Institute of
              Technology through developing a more flexible, modularized core curriculum. The
              enhanced curriculum will continue to emphasize an integrated, interdisciplinary
              approach to environmental science but will also allow  students to develop
              "hands on" technical skills at their own pace.  The Project will uncouple the
              technical skill-building components from five core courses to create seven new
              1-credit courses which will be offered several times during the year. The new
              courses will teach skills in basic computer applications, spreadsheets, ArcView
               GIS (Geographic Information Systems), GPS (Global Positioning System),
              streamwater chemistry, riparian assessment and field methods, and simulation
              modeling using STELLA software.  Three benefits will result from this Project:
              we will be able to enhance the learning environment for our students by
              transforming our traditional computer labs into interactive multimedia tutorial
              modules; secondly, by offering the skill-building modules more frequently than
              is now possible, transfer students will be able to catch up on missing skills
              and progress more quickly into upper division courses in the Applied
              Environmental Sciences program; and, finally, the proposed modules will be able
              to be exported to two-year colleges, thus allowing students to acquire
              technical skills earlier in their education. Through these outcomes, this
              Project is expected to improve recruitment and retention of students into the
              field of environmental science where demand for trained professionals will
              continue to grow into the foreseeable future.
