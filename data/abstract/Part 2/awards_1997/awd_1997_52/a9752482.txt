Abstract    :
              Computer science educators across the nation are struggling to keep abreast of
              advances in research, technology, and pedagogy.  Knowledge of such advances is
              critical in developing and maintaining relevant curricula.  Access to
              information related to degree programs, curricula, faculty, and students will
              be extremely useful in planning and implementing course and curriculum
              developments.  Currently, there is no organized communication among
              institutions on issues related to curricula, pedagogy, or infrastructure. 
              Consequently, due to lack of information sharing, many departments "reinvent
              the wheel" by working to solve problems already addressed by others or working
              to solve problems without access to supporting information.    The primary goal
              of this project is to provide an easily accessible information resource for
              departments offering undergraduate computer science degree programs.  This
              resource will (a) facilitate the sharing and communication of information among
              departments, (b) provide information that can be used to monitor, compare, and
              assess programs in terms of curriculum issues, faculty composition, faculty
              work loads, student enrollment, and graduation rates, and (c) provide
              supporting information to be used in planning and implementing course and
              curriculum developments and overall program enhancements.
