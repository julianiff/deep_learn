Abstract    :
              There is a technology gap in two-year agricultural technician education that
              will continue to grow unless positive action is taken.  Future graduates must
              be prepared to enter an industry that is taking on global responsibilities;
              that is confronting the problems of environmental pollution; that must remain
              competitive in the worldwide marketplace; that requires more specialized
              knowledge; and that is experiencing an accelerating rate of technological
              change.  These challenges require a higher level of mathematics, science, and
              technology education than is currently offered.  To address this technology
              gap, the Technical Agriculture Association, an association of colleges,
              schools, and programs, within land-grant institutions offering certificate and
              associate degrees in technical agriculture, is holding a national conference to
              promote significant improvements within agricultural technician education.  
              This national conference brings together stakeholders in advanced agricultural
              technology from both the academic (research and education including secondary
              schools and two-year colleges and universities) and employment sectors.  Among
              the focus areas of the conference are:  (a)  standards for associate degree
              technicians in agricultural fields; (b) job descriptions of what technicians in
              these areas can best do; (c) programs and curricula which currently exist on
              which these programs can build; (d) common and distinct elements of programs
              for agricultural technicians; (e)  involvement of employers in curriculum
              development, faculty and student development, and research; (f) what education
              agricultural technicians need and who should provide it; (g) future needs for
              technicians in evolving agricultural fields such as precision agriculture, and
              (h) further educational opportunities for students with associate degrees in
              agriculture.
