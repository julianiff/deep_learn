Abstract    :
              In the preface to his classic text, "Principles of Biochemistry," Albert
              Lehninger stated "Biochemistry should be taught much earlier, since it has
              become the lingua franca of the life sciences and greatly illuminates
              subsequent study in any area of biology. And not only biology: An early course
              in biochemistry for students of chemistry or physics provides challenging
              glimpses of how living organisms solve some of the most fundamental chemical
              and physical problems." This project will develop, test and incorporate into
              introductory biology and chemistry courses a series of modules based on eight
              important scientific themes: molecular structure and bonding, intermolecular
              forces, biomacromolecules, enzymes and catalysis, acids and bases, organic
              chemistry, energy and thermodynamics and bioethics. The modules will utilize
              interactive computer visualization and molecular modelling techniques, will
              emphasize discovery and active learning and will be adaptable for both
              beginning and advanced students. The goal of the project is to facilitate
              learning and stimulate student interest in and enthusiasm for science.
