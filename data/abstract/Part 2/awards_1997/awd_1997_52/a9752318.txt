Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to reform the General Education Mathematics course,
              MAT 112,  at Prince George's Community College with the introduction of more
              computer technology, the addition of more links to other disciplines, and the
              development of capstone projects.  Interdisciplinary faculty teams will design
              problem sets that deal with statistics, the mathematics of finance,
              probability, and linear algebra. These problem sets will require students to
              identify and access data sets, frequently using the Internet as a resource, and
              then to analyze these real-world data sets using computer technology. The
              capstone projects at the end of the semester will require student teams to
              access data sets from broad disciplinary areas, determine the questions that
              can be answered from the data, and then to analyze it mathematically. An
              advisory board that includes faculty from other two- and four-year
              institutions, as well as external resource consultants, will provide guidance
              for this project.
