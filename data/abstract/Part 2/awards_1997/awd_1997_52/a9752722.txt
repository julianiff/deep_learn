Abstract    :
              The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) will enhance
              undergraduate education in satellite meteorology by means of a project centered
              on a comprehensive, two-week faculty course for university faculty, to be held
              1-12 June 1998 at the Cooperative Program for Operational Meteorology,
              Education and Training (COMET~) classroom facilities in Boulder, Colorado. This
              will help fulfill the need to upgrade satellite meteorology education, which at
              present receives very limited treatment in undergraduate programs, despite
              recent advances in meteorological satellite capabilities. As a result of the
              program, participants will be able to exploit new technologies to improve their
              knowledge of satellite meteorology through enhanced understanding of remote
              sensing principles and applications to weather forecasting and research.
              Participants will engage in a follow-up project to develop on-line
              instructional materials which, along with the faculty course materials, will be
              made widely available via the World-Wide Web.
