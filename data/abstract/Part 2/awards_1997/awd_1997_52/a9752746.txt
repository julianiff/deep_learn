Abstract    :
              Interactive satellite teleconferences are being delivered to faculty who teach
              science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) students in colleges,
              universities, and high schools.  Each telecast features an innovative "best
              practice" that can be adopted by participants.  In addition, a special
              experimental workshop on the creation of multimedia instruction on the world
              wide web is being delivered.  The workshop combines satellite instruction with
              live, web-based tutoring sessions as well as e-mail so that instructors and
              student assistants have support as they work through on-line exercises during
              the week between telecasts.
