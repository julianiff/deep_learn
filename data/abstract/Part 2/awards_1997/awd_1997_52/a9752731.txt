Abstract    :
              Technology that can be used for wireless information networks is currently
              undergoing rapid development. Such networks are taking an expanding role in the
              world's telecommunication infrastructure and interest in wireless
              communications is growing faster then ever. It is important for schools of
              electrical engineering and computer engineering to prepare their students for
              careers in this important discipline.    This project relates to offering a
              short course suitable for electrical engineering undergraduate faculty
              interested in developing a Wireless Communication Systems Laboratory at their
              home institution or including wireless topics in the courses they teach.
