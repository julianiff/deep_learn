Abstract    :
               The goal of this project is to design and implement an inquiry based
              undergraduate physics course for preservice K-8 teachers which integrates
              scientific content knowledge with research based knowledge about teaching and
              learning science. Research evidence has been building to support inquiry-based
              lessons, student centered pedagogy such as cooperative learning and peer
              teaching, and computer based laboratory instruction as effective strategies to
              improve student learning. This project will implement and evaluate these
              strategies in Physics 100, "Concepts in Physics", an introductory course for
              future K-8 teachers.    Of special concern are strategies to address ethnically
              diverse student populations. Teaching strategies such as "Science Content And
              Language Expansion" and programs such as "Cooperative Education" and
              "Multicultural Infusion" that have been effective in other disciplines will be
              tested in Physics 100.    A collaboration between a professor of physics,
              professor of education, and teacher from the local school district will design
              Physics 100 and integrate it with the science methods course in the School of
              Education. This design and integration process will become a new paradigm for
              collaborations between science and education departments and lay the foundation
              for establishing a coordinated science curriculum for pre-service teachers
              which reflects National and State wide reform efforts in K-12 Science
              Education.
