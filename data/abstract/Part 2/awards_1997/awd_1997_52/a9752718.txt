Abstract    :
              The impact of Two Year Colleges (TYCs) in the teaching of college level physics
              is often not appreciated. This is particularly true for students who have been
              historically at risk. Nationally 47% of all minority students are enrolled at
              TYCs. Most of the students who are trained to enter the technological workplace
              are trained at TYCs. Historically the opportunities for TYC faculty members to
              participate in professional development have been limited.    This two year
              program is designed to serve as a continuing model for the utilization of
              cooperative relationships between university professors and outstanding TYC
              physics faculty members working together to provide professional enrichment
              opportunities for TYC physics faculty members from across the United States.   
              The program focuses on the recent developments in physics research, innovative
              physics teaching methods and successful techniques for recruiting local
              minority students into two year college science and engineering programs. The
              program includes an annual May Institute at Texas A&M University, biannual
              academic year follow-up workshops, local projects and staff visits to the 18
              participants from across the United States.
