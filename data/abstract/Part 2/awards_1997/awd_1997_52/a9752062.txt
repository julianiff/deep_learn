Abstract    :
              This two-year project encompasses curriculum development, faculty enhancement
              and instrumentation and laboratory improvement. It provides continuity in
              hands-on training in advanced manufacturing at the secondary and postsecondary
              levels and links with manufacturers in order to create a skilled workforce that
              can compete in a global manufacturing environment.  Curriculum development
              activities include the creation of two advanced manufacturing courses that
              provide hands-on experience with state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing
              equipment.     The project addresses the need for "recruiting" secondary
              students into manufacturing technology careers by developing a course for high
              school students that provides manufacturing career information and exposure to
              manufacturing technology design and implementation processes.  A summer camp
              for middle school students provides them with exposure to manufacturing
              technology and careers in manufacturing.      Professional development
              experiences are provided for middle school and high school manufacturing
              technology teachers, high school guidance counselors, technical college faculty
              from throughout South Carolina, and manufacturing employees who need to upgrade
              their skills.
