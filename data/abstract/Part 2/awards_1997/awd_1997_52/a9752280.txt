Abstract    :
              This project is designing and implementing gateway exams in the general
              chemistry course for pre-engineering students. Recognizing the service nature
              of this course, we are identifying skills and abilities that are part of
              general chemistry which provide important building blocks for advanced
              engineering courses. These traits go beyond declarative knowledge of specific
              chemical facts and incorporate key conceptual development and problem solving
              strategies.    A diverse advisory panel including faculty from Chemistry,
              Engineering and Educational Psychology is serving a facilitating role in this
              project. The first objective of the project is to identify, with input from
              this panel, the skills and abilities taught in general chemistry that are core
              to the engineering curriculum. Instruments are being devised to measure the
              competence of students in these areas. The resultant examinations are being
              used to assure minimum competency of students who pass the general chemistry
              course. Students who meet the minimum standards are assured of a passing grade
              in the course, though higher grades require more than minimal competence on
              this subset of content. The logistics of administering retakes of gateway exams
              in large lecture courses is being addressed.
