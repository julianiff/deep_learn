Abstract    :
              This workshop is designed to introduce college mathematics teachers to the art
              and science of model-building, and to help them gain the skill and confidence
              needed to introduce modeling activities in their own undergraduate teaching.   
              The specific theme of the workshop is "Mathematical Modeling of Environmental
              and Natural Resource Conflicts," a topic chosen for its intrinsic importance,
              rich mathematical content, and strong appeal to students.  Involvement in an
              applied mathematical modeling project can help students understand the central
              role that mathematics plays in modern science, and demonstrate to them the
              value of further mathematical study.    The formal workshop will occur over two
              summers.  During the intervening academic year each participant will teach an
              undergraduate modeling course or undertake a project at his or her home
              institution while keeping in contact with workshop colleagues via the Internet.
                 The first summer program will include two intensive weeks of formal study
              and field trips to learn about "real-world" environmental disputes in the
              Northern Rockies.  The second summer workshop will be devoted to discussions of
              completed project and seminars on modeling issues.
