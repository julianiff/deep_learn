Abstract    :
                   This project creates a statewide infrastructure that provides education and
              training in network technology for 2-year college and secondary computer
              technology faculty that, in turn, enables the implementation of a computer
              network management curriculum for 2-year technical students, a related
              curriculum for secondary students, and enables the utilization of computer
              networks as an instructional tool.  Teacher preparation is a significant
              element of this program.  Many of the students of this program are future K-12
              teachers.  They will be well prepared to introduce, teach, and maintain
              information technology systems in the K-12 schools.  This project will provide
              the foundation for a smooth transition from high school to community college in
              the field of information technology.  The objectives that are designed to
              accomplish this purpose are as follows:   1.  Establish an approved
              infrastructure to implement the training of secondary and post-secondary in
              local area networks and telecommunication networks.   2.  Educate and train a
              core of 2-year college faculty who are qualified to implement an approved
              networking curriculum for technical students throughout the state and to
              utilize computer networks  as instructional tools.   3.  Educate and train a
              core of secondary faculty who are qualified to teach an networking curriculum
              for secondary students and to manage and utilize computer networks for
              instructional purposes.   4.  Provide the training and resources to use the
              world wide web as a teaching and learning resource.
