Abstract    :
              The goal of Biology 2000 is to develop a new syllabus, complete with course
              materials, for teaching introductory biology to non-science majors and future
              teachers.  Biology 2000 addresses a problem of national importance.
              Undergraduate science education in America needs revision. Too many students
              studying science in college are "turned off" by the experience and intimidated
              by their classes. This has led to an unfortunate paradox: Living in a highly
              technical society, Americans lack an understanding of science. The Biology 2000
              approach helps students understand science and the nature of discovery by
              organizing the concepts of biology around major experiments and discoveries in
              the field.  In Biology 2000, biology is taught as a logical progression of
              ideas starting with Darwinian evolution, progressing through the major
              discoveries in the field, and ending with today's exciting challenges. Three
              components of Biology 2000 are being co-developed as an integrated package: A
              relatively brief textbook tells the story of biology in a highly readable style
              that introduces concepts and builds motivation. Accompanying CDs walk students
              through difficult concepts using interactive animations, video clips and
              "virtual experiments."  An extensive World Wide Web site is a source of further
              detail, self-tests, a glossary and links to other relevant Internet sites. By
              Fall of 1997, five of the 12 anticipated chapters will be in first draft stage,
              ready for preliminary beta testing and revision. We are seeking support from
              NSF to complete the project. Wiley and Sons, Publishers has agreed to publish
              and disseminate the Biology 2000 materials. A professional software development
              company has been contracted to develop the CDs.
