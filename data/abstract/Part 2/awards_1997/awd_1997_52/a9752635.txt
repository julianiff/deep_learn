Abstract    :
               The purpose of this project is to develop and test a model for revitalizing
              introductory geoscience courses. The approach is two-pronged: (1) to use
              appropriate computer-based technology to engage students in constructivist,
              inquiry-based activities in large introductory science courses, and (2) to help
              enrolled pre-service teachers critically analyze the teaching and learning
              strategies used in these courses. The goals for this project are to restructure
              and revitalize two introductory science courses and to develop companion
              science methods courses to be taken concurrently by pre-service teachers. Java
              simulations will be developed to provide natural learning environments for
              students and to allow instructors and students to analyze student efforts and
              thought processes. These methods will be tested in similar science courses at
              the University of Northern Iowa. This project will: 1) produce a collaborative
              model to improve learning in large introductory science classes by
              restructuring the classes to integrate constructivist, inquiry-based
              activities, 2) enhance pre-service teacher science education by encouraging
              student teachers to focus on their own metacognition while learning science, 3)
              provide learner-centered, inquiry-driven simulations and management software
              which will be widely available on the Internet for use in K-12 and college
              science courses 4) model exemplary uses of instructional technology for
              pre-service teachers 5) demonstrate the transferability of the model to other
              scientific disciplines by revising an introductory course in a second
              geoscience area, and 6) provide an instructional software design framework for
              use in the development of future inquiry-based simulations.
