Abstract    :
                         Planning activities will enable Kings River Community College to
              develop plans for preparing high-performance technicians  within the mechanized
              agriculture program.  The College seeks to attract minorities and women as
              nontraditional entrants into this skilled technology arena.  Preparation for
              employment requires adequate teaching/demonstration equipment and materials of
              a high technological nature.  Also required are students who have preparation
              in the various fields of mathematics and physical science needed to understand
              the principals being applied to this highly sophisticated application. Planning
              activities focus on curriculum needs, project evaluation, setting up industrial
              partnerships, strategies for encouraging participation by students
              underrepresented in science, mathematics, and technology, and utilization of
              extant materials and programs in mechanized agricultural technology.
