Abstract    :
              Electronic advancements of recent years have placed a challenge to undergraduate
              chemistry faculty to incorporate the use of modern chemical instrumentation
              into the undergraduate laboratories. To meet this challenge, undergraduate
              faculty members must use and understand the capabilities of modern
              instrumentation. This project updates the chemical instrumentation skills of
              two-year college chemistry faculty who teach in university transfer and
              chemical technology courses    Sinclair Community College and partners (George
              Mason University, University of Dayton, and Western Washington University) will
              offer a series of one-week chemistry instrumentation workshops.  Participants
              will be selected from two-year colleges across the United States with an
              emphasis on attracting women and minority faculty members.  each year a
              one-week instrumentation workshop for 18 participants will be held at George
              Mason University in Fairfax, VA; a second for 18 participants will be held at
              Western Washington University in Bellingham, WA.    Instruction will focus on
              instrument applications in undergraduate general and organic chemistry,
              introduction to instrumental analysis, associate degree chemical technology
              course applications, and applications of environmental chemistry.  Participants
              will select instruction in the following areas: Fourier-transform infrared, gas
              chromatography/mass spectroscopies, vapor phase and high performance liquid
              chromatography, computerized data acquisition and treatment multimedia
              approaches to chemical education, and environmental chemistry.
