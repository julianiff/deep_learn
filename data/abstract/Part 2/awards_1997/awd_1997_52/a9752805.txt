Abstract    :
              This project will run several workshops during the summer of 1998 based on
              "Calculus: Mathematics and Modeling."   The key theme of the workshops will be
              the integrated and pervasive use of a computer algebra system throughout the
              calculus course.  In addition, the workshops will feature a real world modeling
              approach to mathematics, writing, group work, guided discovery, and the use of
              other technology in addition to computer algebra systems.
