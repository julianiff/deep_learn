Abstract    :
                The problem of science illiteracy is a national problem. Although university
              undergraduate programs have done an admirable job at educating SME&T majors,
              they have not provided majors outside of these fields with an adequate
              technical background. One of the reasons for this failure is that students are
              not transferring the skills taught in preparatory classes to their science
              classes. In order to reach the student body, either a multitude of science
              classes must be targeted, or, alternatively, a class that essentially enrolls
              all students. Two classes that meet this requirement are beginning Math and
              English. A large number of NSF projects have already targeted math classes.
              This project instead is working to revise the beginning English class to
              incorporate materials that will prepare students to understand the concepts and
              methods taught in science classes. This is a novel approach, that to our
              knowledge, has not yet been attempted on the scale that we propose. This
              untried approach may prove quite effective and the materials we are
              constructing can be incorporated into introductory English classes in both two-
              and four-year institutions with minimal disruption. The pedagogical method
              presented in this proposal can be easily incorporated in current English
              classes and offers a vehicle to teach science reasoning skills in a less
              threatening environment than the Math or science class. This approach should be
              particulary effective with minorities and women whose math and science anxiety
              levels are high.
