Abstract    :
              The workshops are including as participants mathematics regular and adjunct
              faculty and graduate students.  Participants are primarily expected from the
              tri-state area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut; however, faculty from
              other regions are also encouraged to participate.  A primary emphasis of the
              project is to assist faculty to "bring the lab to the classroom", focusing on
              the content areas of calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra. 
              Another aspect of the workshop is to address issues to increase the successful
              participation of women and underrepresented minorities in mathematics.
