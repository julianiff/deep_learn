Abstract    :
                The MATE Center is coordinating and facilitating the development of a modern,
              national program for marine technology education and training involving high
              schools, community colleges, technical schools, and four-year colleges.  The
              Center, focusing on program development at the community colleges, emphasizes
              intensive interactions between educational institutions and industry, military,
              government, and labor organizations. The Center focuses on the areas of marine
              technology in which the current and future needs of the Nation and employers
              are unlikely to be met by the existing educational system.    The goals of the
              Center include : (1) Development of a national consortium of the major
              stakeholders in marine technology and marine technology education; (2)
              Development of National standards and an assessment of job and educational
              needs for major branches of marine technology; (3)Development and distribution
              of new and existing curricula and instructional materials; (4) Provision of
              unique educational opportunities for students and technicians; (5) Provision of
              professional development opportunities for faculty; and (6) development of
              ongoing funding and in-kind support to sustain the Center beyond the period of
              NSF funding.    The major products of the MATE Center include: (1) A national
              MATE Center and regional MATE Centers composed of a consortium of school
              districts, community colleges and technical schools, universities, and
              industrial, scientific, and government partners; (2) Curriculum materials for
              specific marine technician job categories; (3) Assessment of skill requirements
              and development of standards for specific marine technician categories leading
              to standardized certificates and degree programs for marine technicians; (4) An
              accreditation mechanism for marine technology educational programs; (5) Summer
              institutes and internships in marine technology for students, faculty, and
              technicians (6) Models for student recruitment and retention; (7) A
              clearinghouse for dissemination of c urricula and information on certificate
              and degree programs, faculty development opportunities, and technician job
              placement; (8) A directory of information about existing marine technology
              education programs and their articulation strategies with high schools and
              universities; (9) Newsletters to disseminate MATE Center products and announce
              MATE Center activities.  The MATE Center is having a major impact on the
              education of marine technicians in the Unites States.  In doing so, the Center
              contributes to the nation's national security needs and its economic
              competitiveness.
