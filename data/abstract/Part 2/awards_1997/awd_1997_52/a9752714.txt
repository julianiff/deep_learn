Abstract    :
              The principle objective of the proposed project is to greatly improve the
              quality of entry level design, Engineeering Design graphics (EDG), and
              Technical Graphics (TG) courses throughout the United sttes.  Faculty members
              teaching at community colleges, technical institutes, and universities are the
              target population.  Their students will benefit from the content and process
              developed during the project.  The project will initiate greater understanding
              about the engineering design process that exists in
              university/college/technical institute level introductory beginning level
              (freshman/sophore) design, EDG and TG classes.  The project will bring together
              educational and industrial leaders with concerns and responsibilities for
              introductory design via a national level five day long workshop.    The
              workshop participants will develop strategies and curriculum materials suitable
              for infusing the design process into introductory level courses.  Faculty
              participants will be drawn from community college, technical institute, and
              university ranks.  A monograph containing the workshop outcomes will be
              developed and disseminated nationally.  Twenty-five(25) faculty participants
              and a minimum of five(5) consultants will be directly involved in the
              preparation of 1800 monographs copies (150) pages each) which will be
              disseminated and used by faculty to affect at least 100,000 undergraduate and
              1500 pre-college students.
