Abstract    :
              A team of researchers from several universities have teamed with the American
              Geological Institute, a nonprofit Earth science society, to propose the
              development of the GEODE Project: (Geoscience Education in an Online
              Development Environment.  This project develops and assesses Web-based
              curriculum materials for geoscience instruction.  The goal of the project will
              be accomplished through three mechanisms: 1) compilation of currently available
              Earth science Web teaching resources and the identification of Earth scientists
              currently involved in developing innovative Web-based learning materials, 2)
              establishing and disseminating current, state-of-the art, Web-based learning
              resources through a series of workshops and publications, and 3) design and
              implementation of a Web site for the testing and design of Web-based teaching
              resources.
