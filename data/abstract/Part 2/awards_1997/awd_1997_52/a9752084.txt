Abstract    :
                The Minnesota Laboratory Centered Instruction (LCI) Program is enhancing
              scientific conceptual mastery and technological literacy through the
              classroom-scale implementation of a hands-on, inquiry driven teaching technique
              known as LCI.  This implementation requires changes in the institutional
              practices and administrative structures of Minnesota high schools and 
              community colleges. To address this issue the project is being aided by The
              Center For School Change. During its 31-month  duration, the program is
              reaching a minimum of 24 existing or future high school instructors, 1,440 high
              school students, 9,000 community college students, and 10 community college
              instructors.  Specific strategies for success include: 1. Development of three
              community college LCI learning centers and eight high school LCI model
              classrooms to serve as examples of classroom-scale LCI teaching with strong
              administrative support. 2.) Creation of a supportive, self-sustaining network
              of science instructors to offer support to other interested instructors and
              demonstrate the ability of the program to effect real and substantive change. 
              3.) Creation of a substantial video and multimedia library of classroom-scale
              LCI curricular modules and workplace internship experiences to assist
              instructors nationwide in their efforts to implement LCI at a classroom-scale.
