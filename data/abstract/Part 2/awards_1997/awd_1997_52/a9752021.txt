Abstract    :
                  This project will revise the curriculum in drafting and design in order to
              ensure that community colleges can educate students to current and projected
              industry standards in computer-aided drafting and design.      An in-depth
              study of the design process in a 3-D modeling environment and of the new
              package of skills which the process demands will culminate in the creation and
              piloting of a new curriculum which will include rapid prototyping and CNC
              machining.    The resulting curriculum manual will be disseminated nationally. 
              In order to insure its successful implementation, faculty and teacher workshops
              will be conducted and internship opportunities will be provided.
