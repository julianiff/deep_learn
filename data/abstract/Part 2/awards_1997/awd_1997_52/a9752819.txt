Abstract    :
                Because most graduate programs in the geosciences focus on developing
              students' research abilities, most new faculty members are not well prepared to
              teach undergraduates and, in addition, tend to teach primarily by lecturing. To
              address these problems, we propose to develop a four-day workshop for early
              career geoscience faculty that will be offered three times during the
              three-year project. The workshop will include plenary sessions, mini-workshops,
              and break-out groups on the following topics: the basics of teaching, active
              learning strategies, integrating research and research-like experiences into
              all geoscience classes, supervision of undergraduate research, grading and
              assessment, and life as a new faculty member. In addition, we will provide
              examples of syllabi, assignments, and activities for introductory and
              upper-level geoscience courses, and participants and presenters will meet to
              share ideas and strategies for teaching those courses. Follow-up activities
              will include opportunities for continuing electronic discussions, progress
              reports by participants, and panel presentations by and for early career
              faculty at professional meetings. Resources materials, including information on
              various science teaching resources, examples of course-specific activities and
              assignments, and an advice column for early career faculty will be placed on a
              Resource Website. The audience for this project will include faculty members in
              their first four years of teaching. Participants will leave the workshop better
              prepared to provide an excellent education to undergraduate students. We
              anticipate that these early career faculty can become agents for change in
              undergraduate teaching at their home institutions. This proposal is being
              submitted in parallel with proposals from the College of William and Mary and
              Hamilton College.
