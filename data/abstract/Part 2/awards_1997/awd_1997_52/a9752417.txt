Abstract    :
              The proposed project develops an interactive multimedia intelligent tutoring
              system (IMITS). The IMITS will be used within regularly scheduled required
              courses for electrical engineering undergraduate students. Its purpose will be
              to monitor a student's interactions with multimedia learning modules. The IMITS
              will analyze the student's interactions to decipher what the student is
              learning, is not learning and is learning incorrectly. When learning
              difficulties are discovered the IMITS will tutor the student. The tutoring will
              consist of identifying any logical or procedural flaws that the student may
              have assimilated and then dynamically modifying both the instructional sequence
              and the amount of detail presented within the multimedia modules. These
              modifications are made so that the student may understand any logical flaws and
              correct them as well as clear up any misunderstanding about the material. The
              project consists of three major tasks: 1) to develop and integrate the
              components necessary to form an interactive multimedia intelligent tutoring
              system; 2) to use existing modules as well as develop a new set of interactive
              multimedia modules to be used with the tutoring system; and 3) to implement the
              system as a supplement to portions of existing courses.
