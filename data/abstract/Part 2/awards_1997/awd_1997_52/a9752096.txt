Abstract    :
              Pasadena City College (PCC) will develop and implement an associate degree
              program to educate multimedia technicians. This program will be built upon a
              sound theory base consisting of the sciences, arts, and computer technology to
              provide the core curriculum upon which technical skills are developed and will
              emphasize twenty-first century workplace skills such as those outlined in the
              SCANS recommendations.    Program development will be industry driven and
              involve a variety of "real world" industry experiences--including an intensive
              internship experience and a culminating interdisciplinary project where teams
              of students work with faculty in a variety of disciplines to develop a
              multimedia product for instructional use.  This program will also include
              articulated curriculum development with high schools and four-year colleges.   
              Objectives for this project are to: (I) Improve the quality and quantity of
              technicians educated for careers in advanced multimedia technologies; (2)
              Increase the involvement of the multimedia industry in preparing multimedia
              technicians; (3) Increase the use and development of multimedia as an
              instructional tool by high school and college faculty in a variety of
              disciplines; and (4) Increase the opportunities for students to experience a
              seamless articulated multimedia technical education from high school through
              community college to four-year colleges and/or the workplace.
