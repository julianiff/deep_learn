Abstract    :
              The College of Education and the College of Engineering at Auburn University
              (AU) propose to develop a comprehensive four part program to enhance physical
              science education at the K-12 level. The effort is based on a course entitled
              "Engineering Physics for Teachers" newly developed by the two principal
              investigators at AU. The course is designed to prepare teachers to meet
              national science standards via problem solving using dimensional analysis,
              appropriate graphing, logical reasoning and teamwork. The course theme of
              energy is taken from the 1995 "Alabama Course of Study: Science" developed by
              the State of Alabama Department of Education. Problems, demonstrations, and
              projects use energy-related technologies to which the general public can
              relate. The four efforts of this project are:  (1) to refine and improve the
              existing course,  (2) to expand the target audience to future and practicing
              teachers in Birmingham using real time video link with the University of
              Alabama at Birmingham,  (3) to develop accompanying resource materials in the
              form of printed matter and CD-ROM,  (4) to incorporate and integrate resources
              developed in the course into the "Science in Motion" van program, a successful
              state-wide K-12 outreach effort.  The  reform is aimed at: (1) providing
              teachers with information on state-of-the-art technologies so they can describe
              21st century science in their classrooms, with special emphasis on energy
              usages in homes and automobiles, (2) integrating physics, mathematics and
              engineering with methods of teaching, (3) enhancing interest in science through
              projects that involve energy and engineering concepts, and (4) providing
              teachers with a systematic approach to quantitative problem solving.
              Implementation of the project tasks will benefit both pre-service and
              in-service science teachers throughout the state of Alabama.
