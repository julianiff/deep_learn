Abstract    :
              Two existing modules are being modified to integrate the national science
              education standards with the national industry-based bioscience skill
              standards.  A module from a high school biology curriculum developed to address
              academic standards is being modified to include skill standards and vice-versa.
               A partnership of personnel from the Education Development Center (EDC),
              Baltimore City Schools, bioscience industry, and two year colleges is
              developing, testing, and evaluating the materials and appropriate assessments.
              The purpose of the materials is to enable high school and two-year college
              students to achieve both high level academic mastery and preparation for
              advanced technological careers in the bioscience industry.  The development of
              the materials elucidates the issues of combining career and academic education.
