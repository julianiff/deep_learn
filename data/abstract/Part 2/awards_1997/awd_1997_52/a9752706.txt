Abstract    :
              The importance of teaching simulation to Computer Science majors has become
              increasingly apparent in recent years, as discussed at a number of professional
              meetings.  For this reason, there is a growing need for well-trained faculty to
              teach simulation.  The purpose of this project is to design, organize and hold
              a workshop and follow-up meeting that will enhance skills for teaching
              simulation for undergraduate computer science majors, produce resources and
              modules for teaching computer simulation, and facilitate and promote
              interaction among simulation educators.  The workshop is an outgrowth of
              materials developed from an NSF-CCD grant, "Simulation for Computer Science
              Majors."
