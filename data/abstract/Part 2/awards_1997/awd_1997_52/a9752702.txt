Abstract    :
              This two-week summer workshop focuses on undergraduate faculty enhancement in
              computer networks.  Twenty computer science and engineering faculty from small
              colleges/universities will be exposed to state-of-the-art developments in
              computer networks, with emphasis on LANs, WANs, and emerging networking
              technologies.  During a typical day of the workshop, time is equally divided
              between discussions on network concepts and theory, and laboratory assignments
              involving various implementations of protocols and network designs.  Each
              participant maintains a complete notebook consisting of lecture notes,
              quizzes/exams, and laboratory assignments for possible use in future network
              courses at the home institution.  Michigan State University network facilities,
              including the Computer Science Department's High-speed Networking Research
              Laboratory, will be available to participants for workshop related activities. 
              As a follow-up of the proposed project, a quarterly newsletter will be
              available to participants via the Internet.  Participants will attend SIGCSE99
              and have an opportunity to share experiences.  Experts on computer networks
              will be available to participants throughout the workshop.
