Abstract    :
              This project develops a broad-based, interdisciplinary approach for future
              elementary school teachers leading to a positive attitude toward science. 
              Twenty teaching modules are developed that covers major science concepts and
              inquiry skills outlined in national and states standards.  Each module is
              designed for two weeks of class time.  While the approach is specifically
              designed for pre-service teachers, it also meets well the needs of all non-SMET
              majors.  The modules also provide an excellent format for in-service
              development.
