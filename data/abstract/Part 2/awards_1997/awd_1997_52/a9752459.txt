Abstract    :
              The problem to be addressed by this curriculum development proposal is the
              creation and implementation of a comprehensive, interdisciplinary laboratory
              course and environment for collaborative problem solving among senior design
              students in engineering and architecture. The present programs in Civil
              Engineering and Environmental Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and
              Architecture can be materially improved.    The primary objective of the
              project is the development of an integrated syllabi for a two-semester course
              sequence to help construct the kind of extensive knowledge base necessary to
              build complex structures. A secondary objective is to create an hypertext
              learning environment in which students can obtain information on a need-to-know
              basis.  The innovative aspect of the project is that it is interdisciplinary.  
                The activities of the project are as follows: while delivering the course,
              develop courseware modules for the major repetitive elements in the sequence in
              each of the three disciplines, allowing latitude for the development of
              additional material in the future. These modules will be developed initially in
              a combined video and hypertext format and finalized in a completely hypertext
              format.
