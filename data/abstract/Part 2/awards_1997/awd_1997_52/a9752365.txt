Abstract    :
              Within this project, five schools that have already been active on the web are
              developing, adapting, and testing curricular material using World Wide Web
              protocols. The effort has five main goals:  (1) Develop and test Internet
              accessible curriculum databases using web-based SQL database technology;  (2)
              Link diverse academic communities in a collaborative learning environment;  (3)
              Develop new teaching paradigms such as Physlets and Just-In-Time-Teaching; (4)
              Evaluate cognitive gains of media-rich and multimedia-focused curricular
              material; and (5) Lead curriculum development workshops for physics faculty at
              summer and winter meetings of the American Association of Physics Teachers and
              then organize more extensive national and regional workshops.   The project is
              adopting a common set of industrial strength commercial tools built around
              System Query Language, SQL, database servers. The curriculum database created
              will have sufficient generality to be easily replicated at other institutions. 
              As a result of this project students and instructors will be querying the
              database using HTML forms that are designed to meet school specific educational
              goals.  A formal assessment of students' cognitive gains is being undertaken.
