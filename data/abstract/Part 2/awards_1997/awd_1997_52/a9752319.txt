Abstract    :
              The NSF-funded IDEA project has successfully delivered differential equations in
              instructional materials over the Internet to students and their instructors
              throughout the world. It encompasses classroom exercises, Java applets to
              illustrate principles of differential equations, Java code generation
              facilities, and Microsoft Windows based differential equations solving
              software. The current project is intended to broaden and deepen the scope of
              IDEA. It will provide for additional software to solve boundary value problems
              and partial differential equations, and to illustrate the solutions
              graphically. The project will include continued development of additional
              exercises from fields as diverse as mathematics, chemistry, agriculture, and
              economics. In addition, there will be an effort to evaluate the usefulness of
              the realistic problems and technological tools associated with the project in
              the classroom.
