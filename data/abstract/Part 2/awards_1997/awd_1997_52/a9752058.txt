Abstract    :
                            Advanced technicians in today's high-performance workplace are
              expected to have skills in using statistics for continuous process improvement.
               The proposed project is: (1) Preparing technicians for high-performance
              workplaces that utilize statistical methods for continuous process improvement
              and quality control; (2) Providing world-of-work contexts for learning
              statistics for lower-division transfer students and for technicians in
              training: (3) Introducing students to technical fields, technicians, and
              workplaces which apply statistics; and (4) Making the courseware created in the
              project available to other schools and training programs.    Authentic
              applications help students understand important statistical concepts and
              provide them with knowledge of actual work environments.  The project is
              developing, piloting, evaluating and disseminating four multimedia curricular
              modules which feature computer simulations of real-world industrial
              applications to teach problem-solving with statistics, in particular
              statistical process control.  The activities and materials are being developed
              by mathematics faculty with the partnership of regional manufacturers, a
              professional statistician, and a quality control engineer.  A version of the
              modules runs over the world wide web and a final version is being published on
              CD-ROM.  The modules are appropriate for use in core statistics courses and for
              courses to upgrade skills of the technical workforce.
