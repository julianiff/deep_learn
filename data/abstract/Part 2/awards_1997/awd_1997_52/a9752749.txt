Abstract    :
                The goals of PRE-STAT are to enable college faculty to enhance the statistical
              education of preservice teachers on their home campuses and to encourage active
              learning through problem-solving in order to improve statistical education in
              the middle and secondary schools.    The PRE-STAT project is developing a model
              faculty development workshop which prepares participating mathematics educators
              to implement an effective statistical education curriculum.  A network of
              teacher educators is being established to share statistical education ideas. 
              PRE-STAT is also supporting the participants during the development of
              incorporation of statistical education components into the curriculum at their
              home institutions for preservice and inservice teachers. Curriculum ideas are
              being organized into "Guidelines" for differing curriculum settings.    The
              PRE-STAT project is disseminating ideas including (1) curriculum guidelines
              developed by participants and (2) instructional activities appropriate for
              these curricula.  A World Wide Web site is being implemented and maintained to
              share ideas.    PRE-STAT is a two-year project which begins with faculty
              development workshops in the summer of 1998 at Appalachian State and Montana
              State Universities.  A follow-up phase during 1998-99 is providing support for
              participants. PRE-STAT builds on ideas developed in previous projects.
