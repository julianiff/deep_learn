Abstract    :
              Portland Community College is undertaking a radical transformation of its
              introductory biology curriculum to better reach and prepare students for
              advanced science courses, teaching careers, technical training and most
              importantly to improve science literacy and application of this knowledge in
              the home, workplace, and the world. This revitalization shifts the college's
              industrial age model of science education into an information age model which
              addresses the needs of 21st century learners and workers. The revitalized
              curriculum and learning environments is learner driven, facilitating access to
              a wide range of learning opportunities.  The faculty are creating a new
              curriculum, modifying existing instructional materials and developing new
              materials as they transform the current audio-tutorial method of general
              biology instruction to include: small group sessions and an enhanced multimedia
              platform with multimedia based instructional materials.  The project is working
              closely with the Oregon Collaborative for Excellence in the Preparation of
              Teachers to ensure that students in the course preparing to be teachers will be
              able to use new technologies in their future teaching careers.
