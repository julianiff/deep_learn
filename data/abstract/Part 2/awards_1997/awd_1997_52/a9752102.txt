Abstract    :
              Abstract: SciTeKS (Science Technology: Knowledge and Skills) is an
              interdisciplinary (biology, chemistry, earth science), modular, technology
              education curriculum for students in grades 11 and 12. The goal of the
              curriculum is to introduce high school students to standards-based science
              technology in an industrial, problem-based format. Each ofthe 14, 5-week
              modules is designed to create a "virtual workplace" for students, through
              laboratory experiences, computer-based multimedia, and video. While working
              through each module, students apply science knowledge, and practice
              problem-solving and laboratory skills in an industrial, "real world" context.
              Student proficiency in skills and knowledge is assessed throughout the program
              with a variety of methods: performance assessment using multimedia
              industry-related simulations, labs, and presentations; journal analysis;
              self-assessment of progress; and teacher-generated assessments.  Modules are
              developed by a writing team who work in close collaboration with technology
              education teachers and industry members. Module components (video,
              computer-based multimedia, and print) are reviewed at key points in their
              development, by project advisors, members of industry, teachers, and students.
              After review and revision, modules are field tested with teachers in a variety
              of high school settings (tech prep programs, general technology education
              programs, and traditional science classes) across the country. Results from the
              field test are used to revise modules in preparation for dissemination by a
              commercial publisher.
