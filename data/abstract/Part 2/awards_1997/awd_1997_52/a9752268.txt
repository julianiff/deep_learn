Abstract    :
              This project addresses the need to engage introductory biology students in
              critical thinking and problem-solving by making topics in molecular biology
              more interesting and relevant to all students.  Open-ended software simulations
              integrated with Internet conferencing are facilitating collaborative case-based
              learning among teams of students at a variety of educational institutions
              across the nation and the world.  Simulation modules share a user-friendly
              interface and generate realistic output in a format understandable to
              introductory biology students. The modules work with any DNA, RNA, or protein
              sequence and also give students the option of using simulated laboratory
              equipment to generate data. Students analyze pre-designed cases or else develop
              their own cases using molecular sequences obtained via the Internet. Preservice
              K-12 science teachers involved in case development and evaluation are gaining
              experience with research methodology applicable to their own classrooms.
              Educators can download modules, cases, and resource manuals at no cost from an
              Internet site at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls. Project results are
              being widely disseminated at local, regional, and national professional
              meetings, and also are published annually on the BioQUEST Library CD-ROM. The
              editorial staff of BioQUEST are assisting in the evaluation and dissemination
              of project results.
