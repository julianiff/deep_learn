Abstract    :
              MIDDLE MATH is a project to improve the undergraduate mathematics preparation of
              middle grades teachers. The project is focusing on the  development of an
              algebra/number class,  and a precalculus course that forms a bridge from the
              algebra class to the later calculus sequence.   The curriculum development will
              be based on experience and seminal recommendations by the NCTM, MAA, and
              mathematics education researchers. The model for course development is grounded
              in a dynamic cycle of research on the materials and their affect on student
              learning.  The project team includes mathematicians and mathematics educators. 
              The projects benefits from the strong institutional commitment to improve the
              quality of teacher preparation , and a research video laboratory that
              facilitates study of teaching and learning with new course materials and
              methods of instruction.
