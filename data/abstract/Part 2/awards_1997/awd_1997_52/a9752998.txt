Abstract    :
              9752998  Ledley  The ENSO cycle is the largest recognized source of  interannual
              climate variability on a global scale.  Recent  work has shown that there is a
              statistically significant  relationship between the ENSO signal observed in the
               tropical Pacific Ocean and the sea surface temperature and  sea ice
              concentration in the Ross Sea of Antarctica.  This  work will be extended in
              this program in which we will  develop a true student-scientist partnership
              between high  school students and the PI to investigate the extent to  which
              the ENSO affects the climate of the polar oceans.  In  the first phase of the
              project students will be introduced  to the various components of the Earth
              system and the  phenomena they will be investigating.  In the second phase 
              students will begin by finding data about the climate in the  polar oceans. 
              They will, with the PI, determine the quality  of the data and its
              appropriateness for use in the study.  Data will be examined spatially and
              spatially averaged over  the polar oceans to produce time series.  The spatial 
              analysis will be used to look for patterns of change, and  the time series will
              be compared to the ENSO record to  determine the relationships that exist
              between the ENSO  record and the climate of the polar ocean regions.
