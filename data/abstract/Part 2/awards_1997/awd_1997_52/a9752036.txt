Abstract    :
                    MPR Associates is preparing two multimedia curriculum packages to support
              curricular initiatives in both secondary schools and community colleges. Each
              module permits independent study, encourages collaboration among students, and
              provides a compendium of resources to assist students in addressing authentic
              workplace issues.  The project is taking place over three years during which
              two scenarios are being constructed and tested in NSF systemic initiative sites
              and elsewhere.  They are being built around the design and maintenance issues
              raised by the Boeing 777.    These materials will lead to strong learning
              experiences for high school students headed for careers as technicians in
              workplaces that rely on the use of advanced technologies.  The focus will be on
              careers in aviation and the mathematics, science, and technology subjects that
              arise in important and engaging ways within this industry.     National
              mathematics, science, and technology standards will be incorporated into two
              "electronic scenarios" combining video, graphics, gaming, simulation, and text
              into a computer-managed multimedia package, Products of this grant will include
              the complete multimedia curriculum packages, a teacher's guide, and evaluation
              and dissemination activities.
