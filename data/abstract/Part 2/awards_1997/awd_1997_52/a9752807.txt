Abstract    :
              The teaching of undergraduate geometry courses for future school teachers will
              be enriched by organizing the conducting three week-long summer workshops for
              college and university faculty in which they will:    Goal 1. experience new
              teaching strategies and techniques.  Goal 2. experience and/or see examples of
              non-test based assessment schemes .  Goal 3. Learn about and observe these and
              other examples of pedagogical techniques that have been successful in
              encouraging women and underrepresented minorities.  Goal 4. Learn new subject
              matter and experience new instructional materials being produced by the Cornell
              Undergraduate Geometry Project.  Goal 5. have the opportunity to interact and
              share with colleagues and experts who have common interests in the teaching of
              mathematics to future school teachers.  Goal 6. Learn about and share ideas
              concerning the recent recommendations, guidelines and standards.  Goal 7. be
              committed to participate after the workshop in several of the following
              follow-up activities.  Goal 8. identify, encourage, and train regional
              coordinators.
