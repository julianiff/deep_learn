Abstract    :
                            Northern Alabama is identified as a high technology area having  a
              large number of businesses, industries and government agencies that need
              technicians educated at the two year college level with skills in visualization
              technology, virtual reality programming and multimedia applications.  In this
              study, government agencies, businesses and industries are contacted to
              determine to identify the common core of skills needed by visualization
              technicians and to determine future national trends in the skill levels needed.
              Two year colleges are contacted to determine what level of education is being
              offered and to share curricula.  Information is also gathered at various
              conferences on visualization and related topics. A web page carries the
              information.  The information is used to establish skill standards and
              curricula for community colleges educating technicians for these industries.
