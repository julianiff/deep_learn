Abstract    :
              The project is producing a set of bioinformatics and genetics teaching materials
              suitable for advanced undergraduates in the life sciences and in information
              sciences. Distribution platforms for course materials include interactive World
              Wide Web pages capable of collecting user data.  Collected data and experience
              with courses serve as tools to recursively improve the materials until suitable
              for commercial distribution either through electronic interactive distance
              learning courses or as combined text/computer exercise materials.  The
              materials produced for the bioinformatics course component of this project are
              based upon materials developed for a course (Bioinformatics) at the University
              of Kentucky (http://www/uky.edu/Classes/BIO520/).  A text and accompanying
              online materials are being generated for this course. The other component of
              the project is development of appropriate modules from genomic and
              bioinformatic analyses for a junior level general genetics course
              (http://www.uky.edu/Classes/BIO404G/syllabus97.html).   The genetics material
              explores WHY as well as HOW to sequence a given segment of DNA.
