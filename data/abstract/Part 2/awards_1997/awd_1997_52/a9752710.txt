Abstract    :
              This proposal describes a workshop intended to enhance the knowledge of
              undergraduate faculty, in the area of computer software testing, with an
              emphasis on object-oriented software. The two-week program will be split across
              two summers with the first session held at Clemson University during the summer
              of 1998 and the second session to be held on the University of Alabama campus
              during the summer of 1999. This workshop will bring together 25 faculty members
              from across the United States who are interested in expanding the role of
              software testing in the undergraduate computer science courses. This workshop
              will provide an opportunity for the workshop participants to examine this issue
              in detail, working in cooperation with the workshop staff. Specifically, we
              will focus on:    1. A brief review of the fundamental concepts associated with
              object-oriented development,  2. an in-depth examination of the current "state
              of the art" with respect to testing software, including those aspects of
              object-oriented systems that require special attention, and  3. an examination
              of how this material can be integrated into the curriculum at each
              participant's own institution.  The workshop staff includes two faculty members
              from the University of Alabama and one from Clemson University selected for two
              reasons. First, all three are active in the area of testing object-oriented
              software. Second, this group brings a variety of perspectives to the workshop.
              Unlike workshops where one individual presents his/her viewpoint on a topic,
              this collaborative approach will ensure that a wide range of thoughts and
              opinions regarding testing are presented.
