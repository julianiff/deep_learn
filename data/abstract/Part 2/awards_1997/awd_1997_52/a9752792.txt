Abstract    :
              A one-week workshop on teaching ethics in computing courses will be held in each
              of two summers.  The point of the workshops is to promote the teaching of
              ethics in computing courses as intellectually rigorous, socially relevant, and
              effective learning experiences for students.  In addition to teaching basic
              topics relevant to ethics and computing, each workshop will also include
              seminars on the use of modern, effective teaching methods.    Workshop
              attendees will develop model activities and assignments that can be used in
              teaching ethics and computing, and that they will use and revise in their own
              teaching.  The collection of model activities/assignments from each workshop
              will be the immediate product of that workshop.  Follow-through activities will
              include an email discussion group for the workshop attendees, external review
              of the model activities/assignments, and revisions by the participants based on
              the feedback received.  The edited, revised, cumulative collection of these
              model activities/assignments will become a resource made generally available
              through the World Wide Web and possible publication.
