Abstract    :
              This introductory biology course is designed to serve both majors and
              non-majors, with particular attention to those students preparing to be
              teachers.  Students are involved in collaborative and investigative work in
              both lecture and laboratory. Students are introduced to concepts in context
              through seven to fifteen scenarios based on popular issues or current research
              conducted at OSU. In lecture, students work collaboratively, making
              observations, formulating hypotheses, answering questions, and solving problems
              stemming from the scenarios.  An extensive set of multimedia materials and
              demonstrations present and define the scenarios for the students. Newly
              developed laboratories help students solve or explain the scenarios presented
              in lecture. Students conduct pre-laboratory activities in a Learning Resources
              Center and on the WWW  allowing the full use of laboratory time for  designing
              and conducting experiments.  Computers are used to collect and analyze data and
              produce team reports in each laboratory.  Approximately 900 students will be
              affected each year, including 150-200 lower division K-12 education majors and
              a dozen upper-division science-education majors acting as group facilitators.
              The impact of the course is being examined via the use of test scores, attitude
              surveys, direct observation of students, and interviews with students and
              faculty. Data is collected at the beginning, during, and at the end of each
              semester and about students taking subsequent courses.
