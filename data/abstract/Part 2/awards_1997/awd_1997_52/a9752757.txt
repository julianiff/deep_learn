Abstract    :
               The current interest in interdisciplinary studies recognizes the value of
              tearing down some of the walls between disciplines in order to address the
              problems students face in making connections between disciplines, recognizing
              commonalities and distinctions in ways of thinking and knowing, and
              transferring what they learn in one context to another context. The greatest
              impediments which prevent faculty from teaching in an interdisciplinary context
              are not knowing what to do and not feeling comfortable teaching out of field.  
               The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) seeks support for seven
              intensive six day workshops over three summers (1998, 1999, and 2000) serving
              over 100 faculty teams (some 210 faculty) from mathematics and partner
              disciplines. Each of the seven workshops will focus on the interdisciplinary
              curriculum materials combining mathematics and a partner discipline. For
              example, one workshop will focus on mathematics and biology and another on
              mathematics and economics. A participating institution will send a team of
              faculty from each of the disciplines being studied. The team will study and
              work together on interdisciplinary materials and develop materials to use at
              their home institution. Each team member will study in both of the workshop
              subject disciplines, be introduced to interdisciplinary materials in those
              disciplines developed at one or more of the Mathematics Sciences and Their
              Applications Throughout the Curriculum (MSATC) projects, and develop new
              materials under the guidance of experienced interdisciplinary teams from the
              MSATC projects. Each workshop will be led by an interdisciplinary team of
              faculty from one of the MSATC projects with an additional stimulus - a keynoter
              from the partner discipline. Teams will be chosen based upon a commitment to
              introduce interdisciplinary materials and teaching at their home institutions.
              A balance will be sought to reflect different types of institutions and the
              populations they serve.
