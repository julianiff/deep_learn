Abstract    :
               Much of statistical reasoning involves combining ideas of data and chance to
              carry out inferential procedures and interpret results. Underlying this
              reasoning is a conceptual understanding of some important ideas, such as
              probability, variability, samples, sampling distributions, and the normal
              distribution. Although statistics courses teach this content, students are
              often unable to fully integrate and apply these ideas when reasoning about real
              statistical problems or when interpreting the results of research
              investigations. This project will develop and disseminate materials that help
              students learn the core concepts underlying statistical inference.
              Specifically, we will create instructional modules that use simulation software
              to help students develop abstract concepts such as sampling distribution,
              confidence interval, p-values, and power. Based on our previous research, we
              will build the modules on a model of conceptual change, where students first
              make predictions and then test them, using the simulation software. These
              modules will also include assessment instruments to assess prerequisite
              conceptual knowledge and instruments to assess understanding of the statistical
              concepts underlying statistical inference. All materials (including our
              simulation software programs) will be made available to statistics educators on
              the World Wide Web.
