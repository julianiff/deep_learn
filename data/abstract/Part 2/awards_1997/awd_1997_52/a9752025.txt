Abstract    :
                The Hillsboro School District, working in partnership with Portland Community
              College, has developed an excellent precollege program called "Engineering
              Prep" that can serve as an effective precursor to A.T.E. programs in
              semiconductor manufacturing.  This project supports replication of the
              Engineering Prep Program, locally and nationally, through the publication of
              curriculum materials, faculty enhancement workshops to equip high school
              teachers and community college faculty to implement the curriculum in their
              communities, and follow-up consultancies to each implementation site.   
              Disseminable products will include a curriculum guide and classroom-ready
              instructional materials to teach the Engineering Prep Program.  These products,
              combined with the teacher and faculty enhancement workshops, will enable
              quicker implementations of precollege programs for associate and baccalaureate
              degree programs in semiconductor manufacturing and related engineering
              programs.
