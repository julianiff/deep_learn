Abstract    :
              The primary goal of the Student-Centered Activities for Large Enrollment
              University Physics (SCALE-UP) Project is to determine the best way to establish
              a highly collaborative, hands-on, computer-rich, interactive learning
              environment in large-enrollment physics courses. We know from extensive
              educational research that students should collaborate on interesting tasks and
              be actively involved with the material they are learning.  The physics
              department at North Carolina State University has had tremendous success with
              this type of course and would now like to "scale-up" the innovations so that
              students taking the large enrollment engineering physics courses can benefit.
              The project folds together lecture and lab with multiple instructors so that it
              should provide an economical solution to the problem. The project involves the
              development, evaluation, and dissemination of new curricular materials that
              will support this type of learning. The SCALE-UP Project has the potential to
              radically change the way physics is taught at large colleges and universities.
              The pedagogical techniques should be general enough to encourage similar
              reforms in other large science, engineering, and mathematics classes.
