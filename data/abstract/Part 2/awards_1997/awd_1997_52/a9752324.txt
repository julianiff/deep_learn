Abstract    :
              This project is directed towards introducing cultural diversity into the
              Microbiology curriculum while at the same time establishing a model for such
              efforts in other scientific fields. This involves the creation of a casebook
              that provides alternative examples to biological concepts, the use of these
              case studies as a pedagogical tool, and dissemination of both the case studies
              and methods for using them. For example, fermentation is illustrated by the 
              manufacture of soy sauce, a product that is consumed by half of the world' s
              population and is the basis for a multi-billion dollar industry. There are two
              principal objectives in preparing this material: To show the relevance of
              biology in different cultural contexts, and to familiarize students with the
              idea of appropriate technologies (defined as the choice of a product/process
              that will fulfill a specific need in a manner that is appropriate to a
              particular cultural and economic environment).  Undergraduates were involved in
              the research and writing of these case studies in the context of honors
              seminars. Dissemination of the book and the use of case studies is being
              accomplished through collaboration with professional organizations in
              developing faculty workshops.
