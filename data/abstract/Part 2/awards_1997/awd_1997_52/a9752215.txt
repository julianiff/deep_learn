Abstract    :
              The undergraduate Electromagnetism (EM) course has recently been under attack
              because 1) there is great curricular pressure to reduce its credit hours make
              room for new subject areas that may be more useful to the students, this
              despite the intellectual value of EM and its fundamental role in technology; 2)
              students complain that EM is perhaps the most complex and difficult course in
              the engineering program, frequently being more than they can handle; 3) current
              usage involves only a small subset of the several field quantities that are
              taught, raising questions about our understanding and presentation.    These
              problems had no resolution until 1992, when a new theoretical basis was
              advanced that leads to the computational technique, that involves simplified
              pedagogy, and that enriches the classical theory. It involves the
              reinterpretation of EM relations and its novelty is sufficient that its use
              requires preparation of notes or a textbook for classroom presentation.
              Strangely this analysis was that proposed by J. C. Maxwell but, as historians
              of science have noted, his work was transformed through the happenstance of
              history.    Prof. R.L. Coren, with Prof. C.J. Carpenter, the rediscoverer of
              this theory, has participated in its development. Primarily he is preparing the
              necessary class notes. This proposal is to expedite this work, to assist in the
              new course presentations and their evaluation, and to promote dissemination of
              the pedagogic method and results.
