Abstract    :
              9752947  Galloway      An individual's phenotype may be influenced by its
              parents' genes and environment, in addition to its own.  In the herbaceous
              plant Campanula americana, timing of germination determines whether an
              individual will be an annual or a biennial.  The proposed research will
              evaluate the potential for parental effects, both genetic and environmental, to
              influence germination time and hence life history variation in this species.   
                 In this POWRE proposal, Laura Galloway will evaluate the potential for
              parental environments to influence patterns of seed germination by growing
              seeds produced under a range of maternal and paternal environments (light and
              nutrient) under both controlled and natural conditions.  She will also
              determine the potential for specific maternal characters to influence
              germination patterns.  In particular, maternal flowering time is likely to
              influence fruiting phenology, and that in turn may affect patterns of offspring
              germination.  And, she will measure the association between germination time
              and fitness in a natural population to evaluate the importance of parental
              effects for individual success.  This work will help determine whether it is
              necessary to follow populations for more than one generation to predict
              patterns of response to selection.    This POWRE award permits Dr. Galloway to
              expand her research program by exploring new questions (evolutionary
              consequences of maternal effects) in a new model system (Campanula americana). 
              It will help establish her in a tenure-track position, in a discipline of
              field-oriented population biological research previously represented only by
              men at her institution.
