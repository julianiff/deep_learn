Abstract    :
                 With the Community Colleges for Innovative Technology Transfer, Inc. (CCITT),
              Foothill College is planning and holding eight regional summer workshops during
              two consecutive years for faculty from community colleges and senior
              institutions. The workshops are providing faculty with training in four
              technologies: remote sensing/image processing (RS/IP) and geographic
              information systems/geographic positioning systems (GIS/GPS). The project is
              serving approximately 180 individual faculty over the course of the project.   
               The project's objectives are as follows:      To train undergraduate faculty
              in the use of RS/IP and GIS/GPS using curriculum modules developed by CCITT.   
                To develop additional curriculum modules integrating the four technologies
              into each participant's instructional area.      To instruct faculty in the use
              of the Internet and its resources in developing curriculum using the four
              technologies.      To develop an awareness of leading edge ideas and
              applications that are reshaping the disciplines through these technologies.    
               To adapt and disseminate the curriculum modules developed by the undergraduate
              faculty participants on the national, regional and local level.      To
              increase the level of communication and cooperation among participants while
              developing curricula at their home institutions.
