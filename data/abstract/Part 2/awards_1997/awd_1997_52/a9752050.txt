Abstract    :
              This project will develop an educational infrastructure in New England to
              provide science educators with background knowledge and equipment to prepare
              students to work in the aquaculture industry and related businesses.  The
              project seeks to implement and expand existing aquaculture programs and to
              increase the number of teachers and faculty in middle, secondary and
              postsecondary institutions in New England who are knowledgeable in the
              sciences, technology and use of laboratory equipment to enable students to
              learn about the emerging aquaculture industry.  The project will also adapt
              existing curricula and develop new aquaculture curricula in topic areas where
              none currently exist.
