Abstract    :
                 This Advanced Technological Education Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement
              Project is a cooperative effort of Sinclair Community College (Dayton, OH),
              General Motors Delphi Chassis (a leading manufacturer of automotive and light
              truck chassis in Dayton, OH), KMC Controls (a leading manufacturer of process
              control equipment in New Paris, IN) and Stratasys, Inc.  (a leading
              manufacturer of rapid prototyping systems in Eden Prairie, MN).  Sinclair
              Community College, Delphi Chassis, KMC Controls, and Stratasys is sponsoring a
              series of one-week comprehensive professional development programs for two-year
              college engineering technology, science, and mathematics faculty during the
              summers of 1998 and 1999.  Participating faculty are attending courses and are
              working hand-in-hand with their colleagues from industry and universities while
              learning about the latest technology in the areas of:     1. Rapid Prototyping
              Course at Sinclair Community College at the Advanced Integrated Manufacturing
              Center (Dayton, OH) in cooperation with Stratasys.   2. Workcell Simulation
              Course at Sinclair Community College at the Advanced  Integrated  Manufacturing
              Center (Dayton, OH) in cooperation with General Motors  Delphi Chassis.   3.
              Process Control Course at KMC Controls (New Paris, IN).    The target audience
              is 20 engineering technology, science, and mathematics faculty each year from
              two-year colleges across the country for a total of 40.
