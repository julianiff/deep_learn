Abstract    :
              Introduction to Human Geography, like most freshman-level survey courses in the
              social sciences, is typically taught using the traditional model of instructor
              as lecturer and student as note-taker.  The proposed series of one-week summer
              workshops engage faculty who teach introductory human geography courses in a
              more student-centered model of learning using hands-on materials that challenge
              students to collect, manipulate, analyze, and present geographic information.  
                 The workshop will be organized around 13 activities from "Human Geography in
              Action," a recently published human geography workbook (New York, Wiley, 1997).
               Each freestanding activity demonstrates a basic concept in human geography
              including: scale, region, diffusion, spatial interaction, space-time prisms,
              location theory, age-sex pyramids, development, urban hierarchy, urban land
              use, residential segregation, nations and states, and environmental change. 
              Seven of the activities are computerized projects on CD-ROM.      Each session
              participant will be expected to complete several of the activities, and
              brainstorm topics and methods for future activities.  These workshops will
              serve as the basis for disseminating a more innovative approach to human
              geography, one in which students literally do geography as they learn
              geography.
