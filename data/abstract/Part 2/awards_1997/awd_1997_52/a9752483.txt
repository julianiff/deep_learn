Abstract    :
                Research is conducted to design instructional methods that effectively
              integrate knowledge about science instruction, higher-order skill acquisition,
              instructional design, and intelligent tutoring.  This project develops a
              prototype of an intelligent tutoring tool, that incorporates these new
              instructional methods with real life examples and a collaborative information
              delivery environment to support teaching and learning of chemical engineering
              in introductory undergraduate classes.     The project capitalizes on the
              information rich environment of the World Wide Web (WWW), the full distributed
              and multimedia capabilities of the Internet, Java, and the use of multimedia,
              Internet, and interactive visualization tools. The freshman engineering
              courseware that utilizes study-buddy will focus on fundamentals of chemistry
              with real life examples such as current environmental issues of air pollution
              and ozone depletion.
