Abstract    :
              This project develops, evaluates, and disseminates, hands-on laboratory
              exercises specifically designed for undergraduates who are not majoring in SMET
              disciplines.  A portion of the project focuses on teacher prepartation with a
              significant number of the target audience being future K-12 teachers.     
              Exercises explore both the technological and the scientific aspects of familiar
              technological devices and demonstrate how technology incorporates a scientific
              understanding of nature.  Familiar technological devices such as the
              automobile, the radio, and the telephone are used to engage the interest of
              students in learning about technology and science.    All exercises are
              designed to result in tangible evidence of accomplishment on the part of the
              student such as construction of a simple working radio.  Approximately half of
              the projects are made from inexpensive and simple materials so that each
              student can take home the working device.  Other exercises stress an uncommonly
              high degree of contact with the workings of technology such as construction of
              an uncommonly high degree of contact with the workings of technology such as
              construction of a diode laser light source or construction of a 4-bit binary
              adder from basic logic circuits.  Exercises are optimized for non-engineering
              and non-science students with little prior technical background.  All
              laboratories are inexpensive, do not require any specialized equipment or
              facilities, and are capable of being modified to suit different institutional
              circumstances.    A semester-long series of approximately twelve exercises are
              developed within this project.  Both a student and instructor's laboratory
              manual are included.  The proposed work is based on the "Science and Technology
              of Everyday Life," taught a Hope College since 1995.  Dissemination includes
              approaching a commercial publisher for possible publication.
