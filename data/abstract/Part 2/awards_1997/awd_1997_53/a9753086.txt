Abstract    :
              9753086  Figueroa  The active population distribution of nitrifying bacteria is 
              difficult to study using traditional cultivation techniques  such as most
              probable number and selective plating.  This is  partially because nitrifying
              bacteria grow very slowly -  replicating once every eight hours under optimal
              conditions  compared to E. coli which replicates once every twenty  minutes. 
              Culturing techniques also require the disruption  of the biofilm structure and
              a loss of spatial distribution  information.  One relatively new
              microbiological technique  that can be applied to an intact biofilm sample is 
              Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization (FISH).  The application  of FISH to
              full-scale wastewater treatment systems is  limited.  This could yield
              important information that can be  correlated with performance and then used to
              quantify the  active population for process modeling and optimization.  Other
              techniques such as confocal microscopy and microprobes  may be applicable to
              intact biofilm samples collected from  full-scale trickling filters and may
              provide additional  information for process control.    The main research
              objective is to investigate the  application of relatively new microbiological
              and biofilm  techniques to characterize intact biofilm samples and  determine
              whether this information can be used to improve  process modeling and
              optimization.  Secondary objectives are  to develop new skills and
              collaborative relationships to  increase competitiveness for the use of these
              novel  techniques to quantify phenotypes and their distribution in  full-scale
              biofilm processes.  ***
