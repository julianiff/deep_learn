Abstract    :
              This award of the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and  
              Education (POWRE) program funded through the MPS Office of   Multidisciplinary
              Activities (OMA) supports the research and educational   activities of
              Professor Nita A. Lewis of the University of Miami.  The   research aims to
              develop a new and general class of molecular wires based   on a protein
              backbone.  Polypeptides serve as templates for the   self-assembly of metal
              complexes into a conducting track covalently bound   to the protein.  The POWRE
              award enables the prototyping of short wires   with two and ten metal atoms
              through exploratory synthesis and extensive   spectroscopic characterization. 
              The opportunity afforded through the POWRE program will enhance Professor  
              Lewis's research potential and her educational mentoring of   undergraduate,
              graduate, and postdoctoral scientists.  The preparation of   molecular wires is
              expected to be of interest not only to the electronics   industry, but also to
              researchers interested in constructing tiny   implantable bio-devices requiring
              the production of small electrical   currents.
