Abstract    :
              9753065  Hughes, Esther A.  North Carolina A & T University    Real-Time
              Reconfigurable Network Interfaces    Networked computing environments composed
              of commercial, off-the shelf (COTS) workstation clusters are increasingly being
              used to implement scalable multiprocessor architectures.  As new interconnect
              protocols emerge for clustered workstation environments, the interfaces between
              the hosts and the network facilitating interprocessor communication must be
              better defined.    The investigator explores the performance of various
              hardware and software alternatives which support real time and fault tolerant
              communication using a reconfigurable interface in a clustered workstation
              environment. A multiprocessor testbed along with field programmable gate array
              technology are used to design hardware that emulates a set of fault tolerant,
              dynamically reconfigurable hardware interfaces capable of injecting various
              faults.  The interfaces are evaluated in both fault-free and faulty
              environments with a suite of real time applications selected from a number of
              areas, including autonomous spacecraft navigation and onboard data processing.
