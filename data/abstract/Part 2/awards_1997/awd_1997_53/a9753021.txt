Abstract    :
              Dr. Swann will carry out experiments desdesigned to determine how sex steroids
              influence the activity of neural cells that regulate behavior.  Gonadal
              steroids have profound effects on the organization and expression of almost all
              forms of behavior.  Although it is clear from several different approaches that
              steroids affect behavior through actions on specific neuronal cell groups, the
              exact way in which steroids change neuronal function is not known.  The results
              from several experiments in Dr. Swann's lab indicate that gonadal steroids may
              regulate behavior by regulating neuronal activity and communication among three
              central areas in the hypothalamus (a brain structure).  These results were
              discovered by indirectly monitoring neuronal activity using a novel technique. 
              Dr. Swann plans to confirm and expand these findings by directly monitoring
              neuronal activity in the same experimental design.  Direct recording of
              neuronal activity is a laborious technique that requires substantial technical
              skill and equipment.  Therefore, Dr. Swann had planned to visit laboratories
              with special expertise in this technique.  These plans were delayed by the
              birth of her daughter.  The POWRE award will provide the funds necessary to
              complete these experiments, allow Dr. Swann to catch up on time lost to
              maternity, and prepare her for a new phase of research using cutting-edge
              neuronal monitoring techniques.
