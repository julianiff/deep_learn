Abstract    :
              As we move our eyes, new images are constantly presented to the brain, yet we
              perceive the world as remaining still.  This perceptual stability is thought to
              depend on a convergence of visual signals and corollary discharges reflecting
              the generation of voluntary eye movements.  Visual and motor signals together
              construct an internal representation of space that is constantly updated.  The
              neural mechanisms underlying this process are beginning to be understood at the
              level of single neurons, through single-unit recording in monkeys.    Dr.
              Colby's research goal is to extend these observations to humans.  She will use
              functional magnetic-resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine activity in the human
              brain during spatial updating.  She expects that multiple brain regions will be
              involved in updating of visual memory traces.  The most exciting outcome of
              these imaging experiments will be the delineation of the complete set of brain
              regions involved in spatial memory and cognition.  To accomplish this goal by
              single-unit recording alone would take several years.  The promise of
              functional imaging is that activity throughout the brain can be observed
              simultaneously, allowing one to see the entire network in action.  In accord
              with the goals of the POWRE program, this new research program will
              significantly enhance Dr. Colby's research capabilities by providing access to
              unique technological resources.
