Abstract    :
              9753091  Hastings  Recently, fisheries biologists, using ultrasound to count 
              the number of fish impinging on power plant intakes,  serendipitously
              discovered that several species of clupeid  fish respond to pulsed acoustic
              signals at frequencies from  80 to 140 kHz.  The mechanism for such detection
              is not  known, however, the auditory bullae, special air-filled  structures in
              the inner ear of this family of fish are  believed to play a major role. 
              Understanding the mechanics  of this unique biological system would serve two
              purposes.  First, knowledge of the mechanics for detection of  ultrasonic
              signals could provide the key to the development  of new and improved
              transducers for biomedical applications.  Second, since rather high power
              ultrasonic signals are being  used both to find clupeids and to divert them
              from power  plant intakes and dams, results of this research will  provide
              information on what sounds would be more readily  detected by clupeids and
              sound pressure levels that would be  adequate to modify behavior without
              harming their inner ear.    The objective of this study is to examine the
              mechanics of  the inner ear of a clupeid fish known to respond  behaviorally to
              ultrasonic signals, the American shad (Alosa  sapidissima).  This species will
              be experimentally evaluated  by measuring the frequency response of the
              swimbladder,  bullae membrane, and utricular otolith to both pulsed and 
              continuous wave ultrasound using a noninvasive, noncontact  vibration
              measurement system that has been used successfully  to measure frequency
              responses of the peripheral auditory  organs in the goldfish (Carassiiis
              auratus) and oscar  (Astronotus ocellatus).  Results of this study will be used
               to develop a mathematical model for the dynamic response of  the clupeid
              auditory system to ultrasonic signals.  Such a  model is the first step in
              duplicating characteristics of  this unique biological system for biomedical
              engineering  applications.  ***
