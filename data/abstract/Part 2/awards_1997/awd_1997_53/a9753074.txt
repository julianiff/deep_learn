Abstract    :
              9753074  Hering  The "provision of safe, palatable, and ample public water 
              supplies", a core mandate of the environmental engineering  profession, has
              always been particularly challenging in the  arid southwestern United States. 
              In contrast to the past  focus on delivery of water, which has been manifested
              in the  western U.S. in massive hydraulics works, the present  regulatory
              climate emphasizes water quality.  Increasingly  stringent drinking water
              standards place an increased burden  on municipalities and water suppliers;
              this problem can be  particularly severe for groundwater systems, which have 
              traditionally required minimal treatment of source waters.  A specific example
              of this problem is provided by the City  of Hanford, CA population ca. 39,000),
              which relies on  groundwater for its municipal water supply.  Elevated 
              concentrations of arsenic occur naturally in the groundwater  at Hanford. 
              Arsenic concentrations in local wells  frequently exceed the current drinking
              water standard (50  g/L); compliance with the standard is achieved, in the 
              average, by dilution within the distribution system.    The proposed project
              will focus on the Hanford groundwater  supply system as a case study of the
              issues that are likely  to become increasingly prevalent in the future of water
               supply in the U.S.  Specifically, the project will emphasize  the issues of
              risk estimation and compliance options within  the framework of both the
              regulatory drivers and the  physical constraints of the local hydrogeology and
              the  existing distribution system.  ***
