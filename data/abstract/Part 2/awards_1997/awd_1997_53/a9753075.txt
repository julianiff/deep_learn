Abstract    :
              9753075  Jasiuk  This research program investigates the mechanics of bone, 
              treating bone as a multiscale material.  Major goal lies in  the passage from
              the molecular level comprising thousands of  mineral fibers and collagen matrix
              (micron scale) to an  effective continuum level (scale of centimeters).  Local 
              fields and constitutive laws of bone for elastic, inelastic,  and
              fracture/damage regimes, on those larger scales will be  sought.  The proposed
              project will be involved numerical and  analytical investigation but close
              contact with the  experiments being concurrently conducted at Emory University 
              will be maintained.  These experiments, along with already  published results,
              will provide a basis for verification of  our computational micromechanics
              modeling.  ***
