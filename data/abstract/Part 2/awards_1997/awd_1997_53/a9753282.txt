Abstract    :
                The hundreds of biological databases which currently exist  on the Internet
              form the infrastructure which supports much  present research in basic and
              applied science, medicine, and  biotechnology.  They are significant
              information resources  that represent the fundamental research infrastructure
              for  future competitiveness in scientific research and  application of
              technology.  The rapid expansion of this  infrastructure and its new ease of
              access has outpaced the  scientific and business communities' ability to
              establish  economic support to maintain these resources over the long  term.   
              This project will explore alternative support mechanisms for  the maintenance,
              curation and further development of the  biological database infrastructure.  A
              multi-disciplinary  team will survey biological database developers on sources 
              for and stability of their funding; benchmark the University  of Minnesota
              Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database (UM-BBD),  URL --
              http://dragon.labmed.umn.edu/index.html, three other  biological databases, and
              three non-peer-group information-  based systems, to analyze costs, value
              creation, and value  recover in information-based infrastructures and establish
              a  starting point for economic modeling of such systems;  and  develop at least
              one economic model for the long term  support of the biological database
              infrastructure.  At the  end of this pilot project, one will be validated by
              applying  it to the UM-BBD and other biological databases.  If  successful this
              pilot project will help assure the economic  survival of the biological
              database infrastructure.
