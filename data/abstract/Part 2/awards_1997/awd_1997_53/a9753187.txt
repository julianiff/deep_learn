Abstract    :
                    9753187  Schweitzer    The goal of this study is to characterize the
              immunogenicity and antigenicity of organic compounds associated with
              unpermineralized bony tissues from Cretaceous specimens.  The specific aims are
              to chemically extract minimally altered tissues and to characterize components
              within these extracts through a variety of analytical and reflect original
              molecular structure can be extracted from fossilized remains and that the
              immunological reactivity of these compounds can be used to study evolutionary
              relationships of extinct organisms.  Technological advances in the last two
              decades have greatly increased the sensitivity of molecular analyses. 
              Application of these technologies to ancient tissues has made it possible to
              extract molecular information from extinct organisms, shedding light on
              phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary processes.  Molecular paleontology
              has focused primarily on Holocene remains with remarkable success; application
              of these same technologies to Cretaceous specimens is uncommon.  However,
              recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of applying immunological
              methods to well preserved and minimally altered Cretaceous specimens.
