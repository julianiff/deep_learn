Abstract    :
              Bottlenose dolphins are characterized by a fission-fusion society, an elaborate
              communication system (e.g., vocal learning, acoustic memory, individual
              signatures, sonar) and long-term mother-offspring bonds (infants nurse for 3-6
              years).  Dolphin mothers and infants appear to simulate the fission-fusion
              society at large by separating and rejoining frequently from the earliest days
              of infancy.  The communication system is likely to be the primary modality for
              maintenance of such bonds, yet no studies have identified how individuals use
              acoustic signals to indicate identity, location, or motivational state, and
              thus how they can coordinate movements over long distances.  The aims of this
              study are (a) to determine the functions (motivation, localization, individual
              identification) of bottlenose dolphin signature and non-signature whistles by
              examining their use in natural behavioral contexts and responses during whistle
              playback experiments; and (b) to determine how bottlenose dolphin mother-infant
              pairs coordinate separations and reunions over large distances.  Studies of
              dolphin communication have been limited because it is difficult for humans to
              localize the signaller and record the full spectrum of their high frequency
              calls.  However, with localization methods (an acoustic array) and
              high-frequency recording, Dr. Mann can determine who is calling, examine the
              use of "eavesdropping" among bottlenose dolphins, and explore the mechanisms
              and functions of their complex communication system.
