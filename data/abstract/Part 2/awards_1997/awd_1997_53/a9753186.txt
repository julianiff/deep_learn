Abstract    :
                  9753186  Larson    Kilauea volcano, on the island of Hawaii, presents a
              major seismic as well as volcanic hazard.  Hawaiian volcanoes have also
              generated mega-landslides and tsunamis in the geologic past, and Kilauea's
              south flank is considered the most likely site of such a catastrophe in the
              future.  Frequent deformation monitoring is needed to understand south flank
              instability and to provide short term hazard assessments.  Stanford University,
              in collaboration with the USGS Hawaii Volcano Observatory (HVO), has installed
              a continuously operating GPS network on Kilauea for this purpose.  This network
              currently measures deformation from 2-10 days after the data are collected. 
              The P.I. will extend this network into a real-time deformation and hazards
              warning system, such that cm level precisions can be determined within 30
              minutes of data collection.  She will visit the Hawaii Volcano Observatory in
              the summer of 1998 to work on technical issues with the onsite HVO science
              team.  As a visiting professor in the Department of Geophysics at Stanford
              University, she will develop and implement the software system and work on
              modeling of both seismic and volcanic deformation.
