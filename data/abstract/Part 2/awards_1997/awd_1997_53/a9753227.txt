Abstract    :
                9753227 Parks  This project seeks new knowledge and understanding of materials
              that are at the forefront of condensed matter physics research through the use
              of terahertz spectroscopy. Materials of interest include, for example, a new
              compound recently discovered that contains clusters of twelve manganese atoms
              with a total spin of 10. Quantum tunneling of the spin was observed, and
              because the spin-split levels are separated by energies of 1.2 THz, terahertz
              spectroscopy is well suited to characterizing these levels. Capability for
              doing this spectroscopy at temperatures well below the measurement frequency is
              important for studying other systems as well, such as vibrational modes of
              semiconductor nanocrystals, quasiparticle scattering rates in high temperature
              superconductors, and Drude peaks in materials with extremely high electronic
              effective masses. %%% This is a research enhancement grant made under the
              Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program.
              The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental
              level. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and
              education through undergraduate student participation in research. ***
