Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9753287  Qian Zhou/Purdue    This research program will focus on
              spray modeling that will provide an efficient tool for fundamental studies and
              the development of engineering devices.  The results of the research will be
              incorporated into engineering curriculum.    An efficient group approach for
              the modeling of droplet dispersions and evaporation turbulent sprays will be
              developed.  The model uses droplet groups to represent a spray.  Each group
              containing many droplets has dimensional extent that grows with time due to
              turbulent droplet dispersion.  The model will take into account of the effects
              of gas-phase turbulence on the droplet dispersion as well as vaporization and
              multiple-droplet interaction effects on droplet vaporization within a group.   
              Turbulent spray combustion processes are utilized in many engineering
              applications.  Understanding of mechanisms of the process is vital to the
              improvement of the efficiency of these processes and better control of
              pollutants in combustion products.  For this purpose, computational fluid
              dynamics (CFD) has been used increasingly.  Although much progress has been
              made in CFD models, submodels such as droplet dispersion and vaporization still
              require improvement, which is the aim of the present research.
