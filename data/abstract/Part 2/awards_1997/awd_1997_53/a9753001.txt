Abstract    :
              Carrot cells in culture can be induced to form somatic embryos (no fertilization
              involved) by pre-treatment with auxin.  When somatic embryogenesis occurs,
              cellular levels of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) drop at least 10-fold and IAA
              synthesis switches to the non-tryptophan pathway.  The amount of IAA in older
              embryos, its form (free or bound), its location in the embryo, and how these
              changes occur during development, are unknown.  Understanding somatic
              embryogenesis is important for the propagation of rare plants and for genetic
              manipulation of plants for crop improvement.    The aims of Dr. Shea's research
              project are to measure the levels of auxin in late stages of somatic embryo
              development, to examine the pathway of IAA biosynthesis in late stages of
              somatic embryo development, and to study the influence of exogenous auxin
              sources on embryogenesis.    Dr. Shea is returning to active research after a
              long absence and is currently in a non-tenure-track teaching position while
              doing research voluntarily off-campus.  Her goal is to obtain a tenure-track
              position with research opportunities.  This POWRE grant will allow her to
              establish an active research program on campus that will include students,
              provide opportunities to attend scientific meetings and network with other
              scientists, and show potential employers that such plant research can attract
              extramural funding.
