Abstract    :
              9753054  Wacholder, Nina  Columbia University    POWRE: Computationally
              Tractable Methods for Document Analysis    Although impressive progress has
              been made in recent years on information technology systems, the output is
              still far from perfect.  For example, information retrieval systems, which
              locate information relevant to a particular query, frequently miss highly
              relevant articles. Much of the progress in information technology is due to the
              effectiveness of techniques based on statistical analysis of large corpora of
              text; however, recent work suggests that these results can be improved with
              hybrid systems which skillfully combine linguistic and statistical techniques. 
                The central hypothesis of this research is that systematic analysis of
              documents will provide valuable insights into linguistic properties which
              affect their computational tractability.  The goal is to identify
              linguistically-motivated heuristics which are indicative of complexity of
              structure, vocabulary or concept; these heuristics will shed valuable light on
              how well different systems are able to handle different kinds of documents. 
              Most importantly, improved understanding of the nature of the data that
              information technology must handle will contribute to the design of the new
              generation of hybrid systems.  Conducting this research will help the PI, a
              cognitive linguist and librarian, to establish a career in a hybrid area that
              combines aspects of information science, linguistics, and computer science.
