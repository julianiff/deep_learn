Abstract    :
              9753055  Landau, Susan  University of Massachusetts    POWRE: Certification of
              Security Protocols    This research involves security properties of protocols
              and other systems that are built with cryptographic techniques.  Investigators
              look at two principal issues; the first is ``protocol busting,'' which studies
              how complex protocols built from other pieces (such as secure cryptographic
              systems) can become insecure through misuse of the cryptographic pieces or
              through unwarranted assumptions about them.  The second issue being tackled is
              developing methods to certify security properties.    Research in
              protocol-busting involves the examination of proposed password-based
              session-key agreement protocols, and studies characterizations under which an
              authentication scheme can safely incorporate a small shared piece of secret
              information (e.g. a password). The investigators develop protocols for
              multi-user authentication when the group is large and in flux; techniques
              include graph-theoretic and algebraic methods.  The investigator is studying
              certification schemes of cryptosystems for authentication in a distributed
              network.  Developing a certification scheme means developing a logical
              framework for the various types of attacks that have arisen on cryptosystems,
              and then developing a suite of appropriate tests.  The distributed algorithms
              work concerns developing protocols to delegate authority in a multi-user
              environment.
