Abstract    :
              9753164  van der Meulen  Mechanics plays an important role in the growth,
              development  and adaptation of the  skeleton.  Bone tissue is a living material
              which responds  and adapts to its  mechanical environment.  This research will
              examine the  influence of  mechanical loading on trabecular bone adaptation. 
              Trabecular bone is the anisotropic low density bone.  An  animal model of
              trabecular bone adaptation has been  developed at The Hospital for Special
              Surgery, an affiliate  of Cornell University Medical Center.  Compressive
              forces  will be applied to the distal femur of adult rabbits and the  resulting
              changes in trabecular architecture will be  determined.  The objective of this
              study is to model and  simulate these adaptation experiments.  Finite element 
              models of the experiments will be created from three-  dimensional
              micro-computed tomography images of the  retrieved specimens.  From these
              models, the local loading  conditions will be determined and correlated with
              trabecular  bone adaptation.  Then the models will be used to simulate  the
              trabecular functional adaptation to the applied loading.  The adaptation models
              are the first application of an  adaptation framework developed at the
              Katholieke  Universiteit, Nijmegen, the Netherlands; the model  application
              will be in collaboration with an investigator in  Nijmegen.  The goal is to
              acquire an understanding of bone  functional adaptation important in the
              etiology of many  skeletal disorders, including osteoporosis and 
              osteoarthritis.  ***
