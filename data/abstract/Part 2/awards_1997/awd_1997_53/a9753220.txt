Abstract    :
              This work is funded through the Professional Opportunities for  Women in
              Research and Education (POWRE) program as a Visiting  Professorship Activity.  
               In 1966, Mark Kac popularized the question, "Can one hear  the shape of a
              drum?" Viewing a drumhead as a plane domain,  the frequencies produced when the
              drum vibrates correspond  to the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator. Thus the 
              mathematical formulation of the question posed by Kac is:  "Does the spectrum
              of a plane domain determine its geometry?"  Inverse spectral geometry studies
              the generalization of this  question to Riemannian manifolds.    This proposal
              addresses three topics in inverse spectral  geometry: (1) the classical trace
              formula and the length  spectrum, (2) spectral rigidity and the Laplace
              spectrum on  1-forms,and (3) spectral analysis of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The 
              first two topics concern Riemannian nilmanifolds, which have  played a vital
              role in demonstrating properties not determined by  the spectrum.  In the first
              project, wave invariants, constructed  using the trace formula, motivate a new
              notion of length  spectrum, which will be studied toward proving a necessary 
              condition that closed geodesics on isospectral manifolds must  satisfy. In the
              second project, one-dimensional invariant  subspaces of the Laplacian will be
              examined to show that the  1-form spectrum detects the Sunada method.  In the
              third topic,  the tools of hyperbolic geometry and topology are brought in to 
              elucidate the relationship between spectrum and geometry,  particularly on
              geometrically infinite hyperbolic 3-manifolds  that are realized as limits of
              geometrically finite ones.
