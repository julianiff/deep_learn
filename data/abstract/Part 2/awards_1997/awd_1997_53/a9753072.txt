Abstract    :
              9753072  Axe  Hydrous Fe and Mn oxides are ubiquitous in natural aquatic 
              systems.  Because of their high surface areas, affinity for  trace metals, and
              tendency to form coatings on other mineral  surfaces, they can control the
              transport and fate of metals  in aqueous systems.  Unfortunately, predicting
              contaminant  transport has been unsuccessful.  In this research  enhancement
              proposal, advanced methods in x-ray absorption  spectroscopy (XAS) will be
              learned and applied under the  direction of Professor Grant Bunker, Illinois
              Institute of  Technology.  Access to the Advance Photon Source at Argonne 
              National Laboratory will be provided through the Biological  Collaborative
              Access Team (BiocAT) sector 18 undulator  beamline of which Professor Bunker is
              director and the  Materials Research Collaborative Access Team (MR-CAT) 
              undulator beamline (sector 10) through IIT's membership in  MR-CAT.  XAS
              studies will be conducted to develop  mechanistic, microscopic models of a
              metal interaction at Fe  and Mn oxide surfaces.  Previous studies have been
              limited  to relatively high concentrations (in the range of 1 mM)  with respect
              to typical contaminant concentrations found in  the environment.  With the
              higher flux available at the  Advanced Photon Source, it is theoretically
              possible to  obtain valuable measurements from samples at least two  orders of
              magnitude lower in concentration.  Techniques  developed here will be used in
              future spectroscopic studies  of complex, natural substrates.  Results from
              this work will  enhance further complimentary laboratory studies in 
              understanding and modeling contaminants in the environment.  ***
