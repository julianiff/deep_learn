Abstract    :
              This work is funded through the Professional Opportunities for  Women in
              Research and Education (POWRE) program as a  Visiting Professorship activity.  
               The investigator will study various model equations for  water waves. Based on
              the investigation  of the  Boussinesq systems which describe bi-directional
              waves  in a nonlinear dispersive media, the investigator will  study
              theoretically and numerically the  generalized systems  which include one or
              more of the following factors    a) the external forcing which come from the
              bottom     topography and the surface pressure.  b) more accurate
              (higher-order) systems;  c) weakly two-dimensional uni-directional waves
              (KP-equations);     with or without external forcing.  d) weakly
              two-dimensional bi-directional waves, with or without     external forcing.
