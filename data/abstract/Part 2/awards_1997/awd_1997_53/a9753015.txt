Abstract    :
              This POWRE award will advance Dr. Murphy's professional career by helping her
              establish a new, independent line of investigation in an important area of
              research, the neural mechanisms of mammalian reproductive behavior.    The goal
              of the research is to elucidate the neural mechanisms by which specific
              forebrain, brainstem and spinal cord sites coordinate male reproductive
              behavior.  The medial preoptic (MPO) area of the forebrain plays a pivotal role
              in male reproductive behavior; however, this region does not project to the
              lumbosacral (L6/S1) spinal cord levels where the nerves are located that
              control sexual reflexes.  Dr. Murphy's preliminary studies suggest a potential
              pathway that mediates forebrain influences on L6/S1 levels of the spinal cord. 
              The lateral paragigantocellularis (LPGi) and gigantocellularis pars alpha (GiA)
              in the ventrolateral medulla receive direct input from the MPO and project
              heavily to the L6/S1 cord.  In addition, the LPGi/GiA have been shown to
              potently modulate male reproductive behavior.  The experiments to be conducted
              during the POWRE award will test the hypothesis that MPO efferents target LPGi
              and GiA neurons that project to the L6/S1 cord, and will provide the first
              anatomical, functional, and physiological characterization of the
              MPO--LPGi/GiA--spinal cord pathway.    Currently, only fragmentary information
              exists regarding the neural pathways and physiological mechanisms mediating the
              forebrain's influence on spinal-cord sexual reflexes.  Dr. Murphy's research,
              by closing this gap, will advance our understanding of regulation of mammalian
              reproductive behavior by the central nervous system.
