Abstract    :
              9753542
The Texas Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation (TCETP)
              is a 10 university partnership committed to joint development and common
              implementation of comprehensive improvements in the preparation of K-12
              teachers in mathematics, science, and technology. Fifteen Collaborative Fawlty
              from the departments of mathematics, science, and education at eight
              universities in The Texas A&M University System and from Texas Woman's
              University and Angelo State University are leading this effort. This 10
              university partnership prepares over 25% of Texas teachers Keg and 25% of the
              mathematics and science teachers certified annually in Texas, typically over
              3,700 Texas CETP teachers certified each year. Importantly, this CETP is well
              positioned through its partnership with the NSF Texas Statewide Systemic
              Initiative (TSSI), 47 of Texas' Presidential Awardees (TPA) for Excellence in
              Science and Mathematics Teaching (NSF), and major industry committed to
              preservice and novice teacher internships to implement common systemic
              improvements and disseminate them in Texas and nationally. The five project
              goals of the Collaborative Faculty are Core Course and Curriculum Redesign,
              Recruitment to Teaching, University Faculty Professional Development and
              Instructional Modeling, Industry Internships for Preservice and Novice
              Teachers, and Partnership with the Texas SSI and Texas Presidential Awardees.
              Leadership of the effort comes from principal investigator Dr. Mauro Castro,
              Chair of Chemistry, and co-principal investigator Dr. Francisco Hidalgo, Dean
              of Education, Texas A&M University--Kingsville, the lead CETP institution with
              65% Hispanic enrollment. The CETP includes 3 Hispanic serving universities, 1
              historically Black university, 4 rural serving universities, 1 research
              university, and 1 comprehensive women's university. The Texas CETP will
              fundamentally restructures the core mathematics and science education
              experience of preservice teachers at 10 universities serving every geographic
              region of the state. The Texas CETP has committed $1 million in matching funds
              to the project and $156,250 additional funding for Collaborative Faculty
              interactions.
