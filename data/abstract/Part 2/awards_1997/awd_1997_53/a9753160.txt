Abstract    :
              9753160   Shireen    Intelligent power distribution systems must be developed to
              switch, protect and manage the distribution of power in a number of
              applications.   A key element in any power distribution system is the circuit
              breaker.  A solid state, MOS-Controlled Thyristor (MCT) circuit breaker will be
              investigated, which promises lower conduction losses and higher operating
              temperatures than traditional devices, thereby enabling more efficient solid
              state switching.    This grant provides the PI with opportunity to strengthen
              the Power Electronics and Power Conversion program at the University of Houston
              by establishing a well equipped graduate  power electronics laboratory, and to
              serve as a visible role model, attracting and improving retention rates of
              young women in the power electronics field.  ***
