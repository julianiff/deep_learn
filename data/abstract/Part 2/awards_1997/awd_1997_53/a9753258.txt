Abstract    :
                9753258 Alamo  This project, based on solid state NMR applied to the
              characterization of polymeric materials, seeks new knowledge and understanding
              through the study of partitioning of the defects of metallocene polypropylenes
              and propylene copolymers into different phases of the crystallite lamellar
              structure. Additionally, a study of the phase structure and the
              crystallographic phase transformations of poly(propylenes) will be conducted.
              The project is collaborative involving the National Institute of Standards and
              Technology(NIST), and the unique facilities of the National High Magnetic Field
              Laboratory (NHMFL). The project is co-supported by the Division of Materials
              Research, and the MPS OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities).  %%% This is
              a research enhancement grant made under the Professional Opportunities for
              Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program. The research will contribute
              basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level. An important feature
              of the program is the integration of research and education through the
              training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.
