Abstract    :
               Highly concentrated sunlight is capable of supplying ample process heat for
              chemical reactions at very high temperatures.  It will be used in two
              activities during this project.  The first process produces an aluminum-silicon
              alloy from direct carbothermal reduction of any alumina-silica containing ore. 
              The product is an aluminum-silicon alloy that can be either used as an alloy,
              or further refined via a fractional crystallization and electrolytic separation
              process developed in the late 1970's.  The main challenge of this project will
              be to develop a reactor suitable to utilize solar process heat, and a receiver
              to contain the reactor and direct incident solar flux.  This project touches
              two of the most fundamental needs of the aluminum industry: the need to reduce
              industry-wide dependence on the Hall-Heroult process, and the need to
              economically employ other forms of aluminum ore.  It holds the promise of
              realizing one of the most sought-after goals of aluminum industry research
              since discovery of the metal: direct reduction from ore to alloy or metal
              without relying on expensive electrically-supplied process heat.  It is not
              only the high cost of electricity that is making the United States lose its
              international competitiveness in primary aluminum manufacture.  Risk is imposed
              by fluctuating costs and fear of increasing energy costs.   Benefits from
              commercialization of a solar direct reduction process also include the
              possibility of locating smelting facilities at the site of ore deposits in some
              cases.  Use of high-temperature solar process heat will drastically reduce
              emissions from the aluminum manufacturing process.
