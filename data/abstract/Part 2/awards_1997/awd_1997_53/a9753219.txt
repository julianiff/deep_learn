Abstract    :
                9753219 Murnane  This POWRE project aims to extend ultrafast studies of
              dynamic processes in materials to the x-ray region of the spectrum. Until now,
              the possibility of monitoring the dynamics which occur as a surface evolves
              between different equilibrium states has been very restricted, because
              ultrafast x-ray sources with sufficient flux and time resolution have not been
              available. X-ray wavelengths below 3.5 nm source to resolve the first steps in
              processes such as melting, adsorption and desorption. The soft-x-rays are
              generated as a low-divergence x-ray beam, with pulse durations under lO fs,
              perfectly synchronized to an exciting laser, and are tunable throughout the
              soft-x-ray region. They can also be generated with more than sufficient flux
              for time-resolved x-ray photoemission experiments. The project is co-supported
              by the Division of Materials Research, and the MPS OMA(Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities). %%% This is a research enhancement grant made
              under the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education
              (POWRE) program. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge
              at a fundamental level. An important feature of the program is the integration
              of research and education. The proposed project provides education and training
              in a diversity of areas such as electronic and semiconductor materials, laser
              and optical technology, fast electronics, extreme ultraviolet and x-ray
              science, and vacuum technology, providing strong preparation for working in
              fields such as the semiconductor and optics industries, soft x-ray lithography,
              and microscopy. ***
