Abstract    :
              9753215  Dingus  This grant will support the participation of Dr. Brenda  Dingus
              in the MILAGRO experiment at Los Alamos National  Laboratory.  This large-scale
              cosmic ray detector will study  gamma rays in the energy range from 100 GeV to
              100 TeV, in  order to find the mechanisms that accelerate particles to  these
              energies.  This grant is made under the NSF  "Professional Opportunities for
              Women in Research and  Education" Program, and will significantly assist Dr. 
              Dingus's career by making it possible for her to take a  significant role in
              this experiment.  Funds are supplied by  the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary
              activities.  ***
