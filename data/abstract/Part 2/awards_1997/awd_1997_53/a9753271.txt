Abstract    :
              This award of the program for Professional Opportunities for Women in   Research
              and Education (POWRE) supports the research and educational   activities of
              Professor Laura Pence of the University of Hartford.  The   research explores
              the potential of adapting a synthetic strategy used   with dinuclear transition
              metal compounds to trinuclear ruthenium   carboxylate compounds.  The work
              involves preparing and characterizing   trinuclear complexes having one or two
              open coordination sites from the   liberation of a single carboxylate ligand
              and using the new trinuclear   complexes as building blocks for cluster
              formation.  The work underlies a   research program on the process of cluster
              building with potential   significance to the chemistry of non-organometallic
              transition metal   clusters of biological importance.    The opportunity
              afforded through the POWRE program will enhance Professor   Pence's research
              potential and her educational mentoring of students at a   predominantly
              undergraduate university.
