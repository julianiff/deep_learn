Abstract    :
              This research involves the incorporation of composite materials such as fiber
              reinforced plastic (FRP) into reinforced concrete beam-column connections for
              strengthening/rehabilitation purposes.  FRP materials have several advantages
              over steel including, light weight, corrosion resistance, and the ability to
              mold FRP overlays to concrete surfaces.  The FRP products can be used in the
              initial construction or for structural repair/enhancement.  The use of FRP
              overlay reinforcement is not new, nor is its application to concrete.  What is
              new is the application of this technology to structural joints.  The objective
              of this research is to determine appropriate configurations of epoxy bonded FRP
              overlays to obtain moment transfer at beam-column connections.  This
              investigation will concentrate on an exterior joint of a frame.  This research
              will use analytical modeling and laboratory testing of scaled down models to
              study the ability of various configurations of epoxy bonded FRP overlays to
              increase the flexural capacity of a beam-column joint.
