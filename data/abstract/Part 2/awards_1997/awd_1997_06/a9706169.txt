Abstract    :
              9706169  Tromp    This research involves the use of a pseudospectral or spectral
               collocation method with which techniques will be developed to  simulate the
              propagation of elastic and anelastic seismic waves in  complex local, regional,
              and global Earth models.  This method  requires significantly fewer grid points
              than spatial finite-  differencing techniques to achieve comparable accuracy,
              exhibits  no grid anisotropy and limited grid dispersion, and requires less 
              CPU time because of the use of Finite Fourier Transforms (FFT).  On a local
              scale, it will be used to simulate seismic wave  propagation in the Boston, Los
              Angeles and Tokyo basins based upon  detailed geological models.  A spherical
              version will be used to  simulate regional wave propagation across Australia
              where data  from the dense SKIPPY array are available for comparison and 
              inversion.  On a global scale, the goal is to replace waveforms  calculated
              based upon the path-average approximation with  pseudospectral waveforms. 
              These much more accurate waveforms will  be used in the Harvard centroid
              moment-tensor project and in our  global tomographic inversions.  This research
              is a component of  the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
