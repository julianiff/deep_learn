Abstract    :
                IBN:  9706830  PI:  Peterson    The bewildering complexity of the adult
              central nervous system (CNS) arises through a precisely orchestrated set of
              events during embryonic development.  The subdivision of the CNS into distinct
              regions early in development is a key part of this overall process.  At early
              stages of embryogenesis the CNS consists of four regions that are precursors to
              distinct areas of the adult brain and spinal cord.  The most anterior region,
              the forebrain, gives rise to the retina, thalamus, hypothalamus, basal ganglia
              and cerebral cortex.  These areas arise from sub-regions of the embryonic
              forebrain:  the optic vesicles, the diencephalon and the telencephalon.  Dr.
              Peterson is interested in the question of how the sub-regions within the
              forebrain are specified and how the early development of those sub-regions is
              regulated.  A novel approach that takes advantage of random mutagenesis is
              being used.  Single gene mutations can be isolated and analyzed for their
              effects on forebrain development.  The mutations will provide a valuable
              resource for identifying key regulatory steps in forebrain development. 
              Mutants that block the formation of the telencephalon, for example, will
              provide information on how the development of the cerebral cortex and basal
              ganglia is initiated and regulated.
