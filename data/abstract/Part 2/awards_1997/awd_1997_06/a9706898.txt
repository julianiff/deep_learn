Abstract    :
              9457921  Haile  Crystal growth, chemical synthesis and characterization of fast
              ion  conductors by x-ray diffraction and a.c. impedance methods.   Materials of
              interest include proton-conducting acid sulfates and  phosphates,
              proton-conducting doped perovskites, and oxygen-  conducting pyrochlores. 
              Studies of electrode/electrolye  interactions via in situ x-ray diffraction,
              and refinement of  structural parameters from powder data using Rietveld
              analysis.  %%%  ***
