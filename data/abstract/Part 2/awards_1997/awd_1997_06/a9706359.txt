Abstract    :
              9706359  Buseck  This research will utilize high-resolution transmission
              electron microscopy and complementary techniques to recover information that
              resides in the structural distortions, non-stoichiometry, interfaces,
              precipitates, gradational structures, and other "defects" in minerals.  Topics
              to be studied include:  (1) the unusual carbon-rich minerals associated with
              the reducing environments of Shunga, Russia, (2) interstratified
              vermiculite-smectite formed during chlorite alteration, (3) non-cubic ?pyrite,
              (4) maghemitization in ocean-floor basalts, (5) Lorentz microscopy, and (6)
              chemical imaging at the unit cell scale.   The unique combination of an
              outstanding facility with cooperating scientists in cognate disciplines will
              help the pursuit of important mineralogical developments and applications of
              high-resolution.
