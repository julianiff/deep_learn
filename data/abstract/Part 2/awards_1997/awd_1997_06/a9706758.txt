Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT  Speh/Barbasch    In joint work the PI's will study the residual
              spectrum of the split classical groups. Barbasch will continue his research on
              unipotent representations  for both real and p-adic groups, in particular their
              character theory and unitarity. Speh will continue her work with   J.Rohlfs on
              the stabilisation of geometric invariants of locally symmetric spaces.      
              The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian  mathematician Sophus
              Lie, has been one of the major themes in  twentieth century mathematics.  As
              the mathematical vehicle for  exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system,
              the  representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon
              mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon
              theoretical physics, especially quantum  mechanics and elementary particle
              physics.
