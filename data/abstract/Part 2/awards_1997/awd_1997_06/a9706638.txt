Abstract    :
              9706638  Ague  Tectonometamorphic processes during orogenic pulses can influence
              the CO2 budgets of the atmosphere and hydrosphere, and produce global climatic
              change. Processes include: (1) release of  CO2 by metamorphic decarbonation and
              (2) sequestering of CO2 by rapid underthrusting and burial of carbonate-rich
              terranes. The PIs will investigate processes of decarbonation attending
              prograde infiltration of metamorphic and magmatic fluids and carbonate
              deposition in carbonate-bearing veins. Field area is the Orange-Milford belt in
              Connecticut.  The nature, degree and length scales of mass transfer of H2O, CO2
              and chemical elements and O, C, H and S isotopes will be determined by mapping
              chemical and isotopic fronts across lithologic contacts and evaluating net
              transfer and mass balance. PIs will investigate: (1) oxygen isotope zonations
              in in porphyroblasts, (2) porphyroblast growth reatlive to isotopic fron
              propagation, (3) isotpoic systemmatic of mineral in clusions in porphyroblasts,
              (4) cross-cutting relatios betweenn vien sets and prophyroblasts, (5) timing of
              mass transfer relative to folding and cleavage development, and (6)
              sedimentary/diagentic/low-grade effects in order to distinguish them from
              higher-grade phenomena. Geochemical modeling of fluid-rock interactions as a
              function of  P, T and wallrock type will constrain the processes and efficiency
              of carbonation/decarbonation.
