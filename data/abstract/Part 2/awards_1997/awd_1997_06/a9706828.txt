Abstract    :
                              9706828         Schlumprecht          The concept of distortion
              played a crucial        role in recent discoveries of infinite dimensional     
                Banach space theory. It tries to specify the following        problem: Given
              the norm topology of a Banach space, how        different are the equivalent
              norms generating this topology?        Our main question is the following: Are
              there any Banach        spaces which are distortable but not arbitrarily
              distortable?        Directly connected to the concept of distortion is the
              concept        of stabilization and  the spectrum of Lipschitz functions on    
                 the sphere of an infinite dimensional Banach space. It was introduced       
              by V. Milman in 1971. The author intends to discuss the         question
              whether, after stabilization, the spectrum of a        Lipschitz function must
              be a connected set. Furthermore it is        intended to work on several
              problems concerning the asymptotic        structure of Banach spaces. They
              could be summed up as follows:        How much information about the infinite
              dimensional         properties of a Banach space can be deduced from its
              asymptotic        properties? The second part of this proposal treats the
              following        problem about Gaussian measures: Are two n-dimensional convex 
                    symmetric sets positively correlated with respect to the standard       
              Gaussian measure?              Banach spaces were introduced to provide a frame
              in which        solutions of Differential Equations exist, i.e. equations which
                     model dynamic systems. The author intends to continue his study       
              about their structure. Roughly speaking, one might summarize the       
              problems as follows: What are the building blocks of Banach spaces,        are
              there "atomic" spaces? The second part of the proposal treats        a group of
              questions concerning multi-dimensional normal distributions.        The
              following question is a generic problem in statistics: One has        tables
              for standard normal distr ibutions, but no tables for            
              multi-dimensional normal distributions (there are simply       too many of
              them). So, if we are dealing with a multi-dimensional        problem for which
              the data can be approximated by a multi-dimensional             normal, how can
              we deal with it? In order to find estimates of        confidence regions the
              author intends to  find lower estimates for               probability of
              multi-dimensional events using the one dimensional        standard
              distribution.
