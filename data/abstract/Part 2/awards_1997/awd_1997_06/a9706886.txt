Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT  Moscovici    The proposed research involves employing the
              unifying power of the concepts and methods of noncommutative geometry to
              address several problems which affect broad areas of mathematics, ranging from
              differential topology and geometry to operator algebras and mathematical
              physics.  In collaboration with A. Connes, H. Moscovici  will apply their
              noncommutative local index formalism to the study of diffeomorphism-equivariant
              characteristic classes, in particular connecting the Gelfand-Fuchs cohomology
              with the diffeomorphism-equivariant extension of the Atiyah-Singer index
              theorem.  A second theme concerns the application of the straight Chern
              character construction to the theory of characteristic classes of 
              pseudomanifolds, in order to develop a comprehensive approach encompassing both
              the classical Chern-Weil theory, in the smooth case, as well as Cheeger's
              formulae for the combinatorial Pontryagin classes.  The third project focuses
              on the investigation of Connes' notion of noncommutative manifold and should
              ultimately lead to a complete classification of such objects in terms of a few
              basic noncommutative operations performed on ordinary manifolds.   
              Noncommutative geometry is a newly emerging field of mathematics, rooted in the
              time-tested operator formalism of quantum mechanics,  which -- in the vision of
              the renowned French mathematician Alain Connes -- provides a unified geometric
              framework able to treat the discrete on equal footing with the continuum as
              well as Einstein's general relativity on a par with the Planck-scale structure
              of space-time.
