Abstract    :
              9706642  Lee       The First IEEE/ASME Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics
              Conference will be held at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan, in June 16-20,
              1997.  It is jointly organized by the Industrial Electronics Society and the
              Robotics and Automation Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
              Engineers and the Dynamic Systems and Control Division of the American Society
              of Mechanical Engineers.  The conference is aimed to provide a forum for
              researchers to meet and discuss the latest developments in mechatronics, a
              synergistic integration of mechanical engineering with electronics and
              intelligent computer control in the design and manufacture of products and
              processes.  The theme of this first conference is Imformatics and Communication
              in Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics.       This conference is the first of its
              kind and is important to the future advances in the knowledge creation in
              mechatronics with many practical applications.    ***
