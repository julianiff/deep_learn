Abstract    :
              9706233  Serpa   The most well-exposed extensional/transtensional system in
              North America occurs in close proximity to Death Valley, California.  It has
              been used as a natural laboratory to study large-scale crustal extension. 
              However, two different models have been developed for this extension, one
              requiring nearly 400% extension and the other only 50-100%.  This difference is
              important because the first model requires large amounts of lower-crustal flow
              to accommodate supercrustal thinning to reconcile with the observed crustal
              thickness, and impacts estimates of effective viscosity of the lower crust. 
              The distinction between these two models is clear, and each makes specific
              predictions that can be tested.  This project will attempt to determine the
              importance of extensional versus transtensional tectonics in the formation of
              the Wingate Wash basin.  Results will significantly improve understanding of
              this extensional/transtensional area and will help improve estimates of crustal
              parameters involved in extensional models and processes.
