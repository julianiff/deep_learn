Abstract    :
              9706720  Mitchell    This research involves the mapping of attenuative
              dispersion  along paths through the source zone of New Madrid earthquakes as 
              well as along paths outside of, but contiguous to, that zone.  Both theoretical
              and observational research has shown that waves  which have been attenuated by
              either intrinsic anelasticity or by  scattering processes also exhibit
              dispersion.  Attenuative  dispersion associated with regional seismic phases
              has been found  to be easily measurable in regions where those phases attenuate
               rapidly with distance.  Abundant amounts of data obtained from  PANDA
              stations, as well as from USNSN stations, in and  surrounding the New Madrid
              seismic zone should be available for  these studies.  Relating the variation of
              Q to the properties of  the crust may provide new information on earthquake
              processes in  the New Madrid region.  This research is a component of the 
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
