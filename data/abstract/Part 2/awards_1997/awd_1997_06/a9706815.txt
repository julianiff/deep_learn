Abstract    :
              9706815  Wuttig    This is a renewal grant for quantitative studies of the 
              evolution of the martensitic phase in constrained thin films  with an emphasis
              on the martensitic transformation at  constant strain.  Much is known already
              about this  transformation as it occurs at constant stress and, of  course,
              normally the differences in mechanical behavior of  materials under conditions
              of constant stress and strain are  not very large.  This is not the case for
              the martensitic  transformation, where a special kind of pseudo-elasticity  can
              occur.  The studies build on results and experiences  gained during the
              previous three-year NSF grant.  Specifically, the evolution of the two phase
              state, alpha  prime and gamma, is investigated by examining the  simultaneous
              evolution of the microstructure, stress and  modulus of single crystalline
              shape memory alloy (SMA) films  on a substrate which serves to constrain this
              state.  Microstructural evolution is modeled and the results are  compared to
              the experimentally observed mesoscopic two-phase  structure and related
              macroscopic stresses and pseudo-  elastic moduli.  It is expected that complete
              closure will  be achieved leading to an understanding of the evolution of  the
              martensitic phase transformation in constrained films on  the mesoscale.  The
              studies focus initially on NiTi films.  In later stages of the research other
              systems, such as  ternary FeNi-based alloys, Ni-free SMAs, FePt, FePd and Cu- 
              based SMA alloys will be investigated.  %%%  This phenomenon is of scientific
              interest and important in  composite thin film actuators based on shape memory 
              concepts.  ***
