Abstract    :
              9706489    Williams          The proposed research aims to apply and further
              develop microlocal  methods (localization in phase space; Fourier analysis; 
              pseudodifferential, Fourier integral, and paradifferential operators)  for the
              study of several types of nonlinear wave problems: rigorous   nonlinear
              geometric optics for continuous and discontinuous (shock)  solutions of
              quasilinear boundary problems, new mechanisms for blowup,  and semilinear
              diffraction of generic singularities by smooth obstacles.         The work on
              shocks has the closest connection to real-world  applications.  Shocks arise in
              many contexts involving the flow of some  type of "fluid", which usually means
              a gas like air or a liquid like  water. They form in connection with flights of
              jets, reentry of space  shuttles, and as a result of combustion or explosion,
              for example.  Geometric optics is a mathematical method that can be used to
              obtain  qualitative information and make predictions about shocks, which is 
              based on constructing and analyzing "approximate shocks".    In the past there
              has been uncertainty about whether the approximate  shocks really behave like
              the exact physical shocks.  Our work aims  to understand precisely when the
              approximate shocks are and are not  close to exact shocks.
