Abstract    :
              The investigators are using an existing instrument, the Absolute Solar
              Transmission Interferometer (ASTI), to determine the exoatmospheric solar
              spectral radiance in the 1.0 to 5 micron region.  The ASTI, originally
              developed to measure the solar spectral radiance at ground level for studying
              radiation budget, has a very large dynamic range, and a spectral resolution of
              2 wave numbers.  The measurements and their subsequent analysis determine the
              exoatmospheric solar radiance to a 2 - 3% uncertainty.
