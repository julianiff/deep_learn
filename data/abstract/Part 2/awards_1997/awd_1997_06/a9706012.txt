Abstract    :
              9706012  Reeder  The proposed research will examine specific aspects of the
              incorporation mechanisms of trace elements into carbonate minerals
              crystallizing from low temperature aqueous solutions.  A significant aspect of
              the research involves the application of synchrotron-based X-ray adsorption
              fine structure spectroscopy to determine directly the detailed local
              coordination of incorporated trace metal species.  The PI proposes to examine
              the coordination environment of uranium species coprecipitated in calcite and
              aragonite, the incorporation of barium into calcite, and structural
              perturbations caused by Mn in the CaCO3-MnCO3 system.  The proposed research
              will lead to a better understanding of the roles that trace and minor elements
              play as tracers in minerals recording the petrogenetic and diagenetic processes
              and also of the processes that control their mobility and fate in the
              near-surface environment.
