Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    Bao Qin   Li    Li will study necessary and sufficient geometric
              conditions  for an analytic variety to be an interpolating variety for weighted
                spaces of entire functions. In a second direction,  he will use  results and
              methods of interpolation to study exponential polynomials   and obtain
              Lojasiewicz type inequalities, which  are tied to some   important conjectures
              in complex and harmonic analysis.  In a third  direction, he plans to find
              estimates on the volume of zero  varieties for entire holomorphic maps, which
              are closely related  to geometric aspects of interpolating varieties. He will
              also study   the "refined" Nevanlinna second fundamental theorem for moving
              targets,    with special attention given to uniqueness problems of meromorphic 
               functions and meromorphic solutions of (partial) differential equations.   
              Many important problems like finding all distribution solutions (or   finding
              out whether there are any) to systems of convolution equations    arising in
              signal processing, image compression, and other   applications  can be
              translated to interpolation  problems for entire functions with growth
              conditions.  The topic itself is one of the major problems in several  complex 
               variables. The proposed research has as its goal to enrich and  advance the
              above areas in several complex variables and their   applications.
