Abstract    :
              9706216  Hodges  The Indian-Asian collision zone is the type locality of a
              continent-continent collision, and studies of this zone  reveal the tectonic
              processes of such collisions that are not obtainable in more ancient collision
              systems.  One  particularly confounding feature of results of recent work is
              that the northern portion of the Tibetan Himalayan  range seems to display
              mostly E-W extension and graben filling, while the southern part of this orogen
              seems to reflect N-S shortening and recent exhumation. The structural and
              tectonic processes that allow this relationship to exist are not well known,
              and are the subject of this project.  They will investigate the geology of this
              region using tectonic geomorphology,  for active fault analysis, and
              sedimentology, stratigraphy, paleomagnetism for the analysis of sediments
              filling grabens. If they are successful, they will be able to test whether 
              displacement on the south Tibet detachment system  alone can explain this south
              to north transition from compression and extension, as well as constrain the
              timing of the uplift of the topography. This in turn will allow further testing
              of the relationship of this topography to climate evolution in the late
              Cenozoic.
