Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      Nazarov    Nazarov will investigate exponential polynomials and
              lacunary series   and on weighted norm inequalities. The objectives of the
              proposed   research are: 1) to get a complete  version of the Turan Lemma, 2)
              to   investigate the distribution of  values of trigonometric polynomials  
              with random spectra, 3) to complete the theory of weighted norm   inequalities
              for singular  integral operators with one matrix weight   and 4)to start an
              attack  on the scalar two-weight case.    The problems described in this
              proposal are of fundamental character   and have numerous connections to other
              fields some of which in their   turn  have a direct impact on science and
              technology. For  example, fast computing  and data compression based  on
              wavelets.   The idea of the wavelet compression is strikingly simple: you just 
               take the wavelet expansion of your image  and drop all small terms,  
              memorizing only several "large" ones.   The problem is that you   should be
              sure that the large terms are really few and that the small   terms together
              cannot add up to  something huge. The formal requirement   (which is more or
              less just  the above phrase translated into   mathematical language) is that
              the  system of wavelets should form a   basis in a certain function space.
