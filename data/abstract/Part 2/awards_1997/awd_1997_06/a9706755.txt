Abstract    :
              DMS-9706755  Harrell    This is the block travel grant for the 1997 Congress of
              the International Association of Mathematical Physics and for development of
              new scientific collaboration in the Asian-Pacific Region    The XII-th
              International Conference on Mathematical Physics is to be held in Brisbane,
              Australia in July, 1997. This is organized by the International Association of
              Mathematical Physics. The project supports participation of 25 U.S. scientists
              and mathematicians.  It is also a vehicle to initiate new scientific contacts
              in the Asian-Pacific Region.    The competition for these funds is national.
              The criteria for selection is scientific excellence and an indication that the
              applicant's future research and professional growth will benefit from
              participation in the conference and further contacts in the Asian-Pacific
              region. Preference is given to recent Ph.D.'s and outstanding graduate
              students. The organizers are organizing contacts with established researchers
              who are  willing to act as hosts and organize new contacts.    This
              international encounter covers the full spectrum of recent developments of
              mathematical physics, from the dynamics of classical systems to relativity and
              quantum field theory. It includes new mathematical techniques as well as the
              analysis of increasingly complex physical systems.
