Abstract    :
              9706220  Rothman    The PI proposes work on granular fluids that includes the
              development of numerical models of particular geophysical flows in addition to
              work on a basic theory applicable to a wide range of phenomena.  Special
              emphasis will be focused on the erosion of granular surfaces and will
              concentrate on the evolution of hillslope topography and the initiation of
              channel networks.    The focus will be on the study of statistical correlations
              evident in both field data and models, and their subsequent use to constrain
              continuum formulations of the problem.  The second emphasis of the proposal is
              to study pattern formation in shaken sand, with the goal of understanding the
              transition from wavelike patterns to localized excitations, the latter of which
              have thus far appeared only in granular systems.  Some work will concentrate on
              the development of models for the study of wet granular deposition.  ***
