Abstract    :
              9706916  B. Fornberg     Pseudospectral (PS) methods - a high-accuracy
              alternative to finite  difference (FD) and finite elemnt methods - are
              particularly effective for  solving convection-dominated PDEs over long times
              and in relatively simple  geometries. Both the algorithms themselves and their
              analysis have usually  been closely tied to expansions in different classes of
              orthogonal  functions. The recent book "A Practical Guide to Pseudospectral
              Methods"  (by the present investigator)  notes that a large body of
              generalizations,  enhancements and insights can be gained by viewing PS methods
              instead as  special cases of FD methods.  These opportunities will now be
              explored  further, in particular with the aim of combining the PS approach with
               domain decomposition for time-dependent computational electromagnetics.       
                Pseudospectral (PS) methods were first proposed in the early 1970's (in 
              connection with meteorology and turbulence modeling). They are now  routinely
              used in many fields such as nonlinear wave motions, weather  forecasting, fluid
              mechanics, computational chemistry, and with  time-domain computational
              electromagnetics (TD CEM) emerging as a new and  potentially major application
              area. This present investigation will  explore how a series of new leads for PS
              methods can be developed further  and then brought to bear on applications, in
              particular in the field of TD  CEM. Such applications include simulations of
              the radar visibility of  objects and of how electromagnetic fields are
              generated by/ interact with  components on integrated circuits.
