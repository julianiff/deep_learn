Abstract    :
              9706690  Kellogg    Using a combination of Global Positioning System (GPS)
              measurements, historical data, and viscoelastic modeling, The PI will determine
              the deformation on the White Wolf Fault, southern California. This fault was
              responsible for the 1952 Kern County Earthquake (magnitude 7.8).   The research
              plan includes: (1) reoccupation of the previously studied geodetic network to
              establish the long-term deformation rates and examine the effects of the
              Northridge earthquake; (2) occupation of geodetic sites near the northern end
              of the fault to determine the strain associated with seismic activity in this
              region; (3) analysis of available geodetic data from 1952 and 1953 to determine
              the deformation associated with the Kern county earthquake, and   (4)
              simulation of the deformation using a numerical model of a faulted,
              viscoelastic medium to determine the crustal rheology.  ***
