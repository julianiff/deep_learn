Abstract    :
              9706231    Souganidis    The PI proposes to study a broad range of problems,
              some motivated by  applications in phase transitions, turbulent combustion,
              etc., which   arise in the areas of hyperbolic and parabolic/elliptic nonlinear
              partial   differential equations and probability. More precisely, using
              techniques  from analysis, partial differential equations, and probability, the
              PI   proposes to continue his program working in the following five   general
              areas:  A. Kinetic theory of conservation laws.  B. Viscosity solutions of
              fully nonlinear elliptic and parabolic partial   differential equations.  C.
              Fully nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations.  D. Phase
              transitions.  E. Turbulent reaction-diffusion equations.    Most of the
              questions to be studied in this project are of a theoretical  nature, although
              much of the work in turbulent reaction-diffusion   equations deals with
              modelling and computations. The questions   related to this last topic as well
              as those related to   phase transitions and fully  nonlinear stochastic pde are
              important  in material and environmental/oceanic sciences. Indeed these
              questions  and the anticipated answers should provide appropriate  mathematical
              models and insight for the study of basic questions   in these sciences.
