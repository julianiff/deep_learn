Abstract    :
              9706230  Geary    The late Miocene Pannonian lake harbored one of the most
              diverse endemic lacustrine mollusc faunas ever known, including approximately
              one thousand described species, dozens of endemic genera, several endemic
              subfamilies, and two endemic families.  In spite of the textbook nature of this
              case (e.g. Stanley 1979- Ager 1963, 1993, Sepkoski 1993), the evolution of the
              Pannonian lake malacofauna is known only from a few studies of individual
              lineages (e.g. Geary 1990a- Muller and Magyar 1992a), but has not been
              approached in a comprehensive way.    In addition to its impressive
              malacofauna, the Pannonian lake presents an ideal system for paleontological
              research because its paleoenvironment and stratigraphy are extremely well
              studied.  Many aspects of lake paleoenvironment and history, including the
              origin of the lake, its sedimentation and water depth, lake level fluctuations,
              paleogeography, and paleoclimate have been the focus of recent work.  A newly
              revised chronostratigraphy has just been completed, which incorporates detailed
              biostratigraphic, seismic stratigraphic, and magnetostratigraphic data.  The
              PI's Hungarian collaborators, Drs.  Imre Magyar and Pal Muller, have been
              important contributors to this body of knowledge.  The work we propose here
              includes several smaller projects that will further enhance our
              paleoenvironmental understanding.  Thus, all the pieces are in place for a
              detailed examination of the relationship between environmental and evolutionary
              change in this classic system,    We propose to examine the evolutionary
              radiation of the major clades of Pannonian lake molluscs in this detailed
              paleoenvironmental context.  We intend to: 1) conduct a comprehensive review
              and taxonomic revision of four of the most diverse molluscan families, 2) use
              morphometrics to characterize geographic variation and morphological change
              over time in selected lineages from the Pannonian lake, and 3) interpret the
              taxonomic and morphological results in an environmental context.  
              Specifically, we will test the idea of coordinated, stasis among various
              molluscan lineages, and we will examine how environmental stability or change
              influenced the diversity and morphological evolution of Pannonian lake
              molluscs.  Geologically gradual tempos appear to have been documented in
              several Pannonian basin mollusc lineages (Geary 1990a; Muller and Magyar 1992a;
              Staley 1992- Staley et al. 1992).  A more comprehensive view of Pannonian lake
              molluscan evolution, including detailed documentation of change in additional
              lineages, will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms behind various
              evolutionary tempos.
