Abstract    :
              9706445  Bauer  One of the more critical problems in understanding crustal
              deformation is understanding deformation mechanisms and strain partitioning in
              the middle and lower crust where plutonism and partial melting are not critical
              factors for crustal softening. This collaborative study address this problem
              through the examination of lower crustal, Late Archean rocks in southeastern
              Wyoming.  The study will involve field mapping  to determine the distribution
              of strain, metamorphic petrology to establish the pressure-temperature (depth)
              conditions of deformation, and geochronology to determine the absolute timing
              of the various deformation events. the laboratory data will allow the
              reconstruction of the depth and time conditions of the various deformations,
              and textural work will allow mechanisms of deformation to be identified.  In
              addition to this, the data will bear directly on the structural evolution of
              this package of rocks, and allow the tectonic reconstruction of the Archean
              boundary of this crustal fragment.
