Abstract    :
               This project involves the research of a cultural anthropologist from East
              Carolina University, studying the transformation of work through multiple
              livelihoods.  The project will study Mexican and Jamaican transnational workers
              carrying special temporary worker visas who work in the seafood processing and
              tourist labor markets of the mid-Atlantic region of the US, employed in
              seasonal jobs formerly staffed primarily by local women.  The increasing
              reliance on foreign labor and decreasing reliance on native labor signals a
              convergence of the working conditions and opportunities of workers in the
              Mid-Atlantic region with those of workers from Jamaica and Mexico.  The project
              will examine the social network ties which enable workers to obtain public and
              private assistance, in their home as well as their host country,  by focusing
              on a sample of US, Mexican, and Jamaican workers. The specific hypotheses to be
              tested deal with the importance of formal and informal economic and political
              activities in the home countries as affected by migrant labor experiences, as
              well as the effects of specific work experiences on the cultural models of
              workers regarding work and social opportunities.  Combining in-depth open-ended
              interviewing and local historical research and the more structured measures of
              cultural consensus testing and sorting tasks, the research will determine the
              character and work experience of workers in developed and underdeveloped
              regions; examine the roles of government in this process; determine how the
              seasonal labor market experience influences the formation of human social and
              cultural capital; and explore the relation of cultural understandings and
              expectations and social-cultural capital.  This research will advance our
              understanding of the human capital of transnational workers and the new
              knowledge will be of great interest to planners and public policy makers
