Abstract    :
               This project involves a cultural anthropologist and a psychologist from Harvard
              University studying the adaptation of recent (within 6 months) immigrant
              students 10-14 years old (Koreans and Vietnamese from Asia, Dominicans and
              Haitians from the Caribbean, and Mexicans and Salvadorans from Latin America)
              to secondary school in the Boston area.  The project will get massive amounts
              of data over five years to observe how students (75 in each ethnic category)
              adjust to their new country, and to explain the troubling fact that among
              nearly all immigrant groups today school achievement declines with increasing
              length of residence in the US.  Four student research assistants will interview
              students in depth and get a variety of measures of their psychological and
              social adjustment.  Methods include participant observation, focus groups,
              formal psychosocial measurements and perusal of academic records.  The specific
              research questions will focus on the family system, the cultural models of
              schooling, the relation of social, cultural and economic capital to schooling
              success, neighborhood factors, time allocation, peer networks, and gender.    
              This research is important because the declining school performance of most
              immigrant groups associated with increased length of residence in the US is
              greatly troubling to this society.  This longitudinal study will provide a
              significant comparative case study to give insights into causal factors
              affecting this phenomenon, which will be available to be used by school
              administrators and policy makers to improve the situation.
