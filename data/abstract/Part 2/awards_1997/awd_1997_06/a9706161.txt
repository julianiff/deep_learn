Abstract    :
              ***  This   award,  in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode,  supports
               a preliminary investigation of the question of  how  to  dynamically  allocate
               task control responsibilities  between   a  human  and  robot in a
              teleoperation setting. The  approach  will  involve  the  development of a new
              control scheme  in  which  the  inputs  from  computer and human can be
              smoothly integrated,  and  responsibilities for processing of sensed
              information and  actual  control of the cooperative task can be dynamically
              allocated.  In  addition,   systematic categorization of expected subtasks 
              along  with the associated assistance strategies will allow the computer  to 
              select  system parameters under this unified architecture  to  suit  a variety
              of situations. With this concept, an attempt will  be  made  to  bridge  the 
              gap  between  traditionally  practiced  teleoperation  and desirable but
              impractical autonomous  robotics  in  an  unstructured environment.  If
              successful,  this  approach  should  lead  to a general strategy that could
              enable  robots  to  relieve   some   of  the tiring demands on human 
              performance  in  teleoperation.***
