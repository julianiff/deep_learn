Abstract    :
              9706066  Cohen           This Focused Reqearch Group project involves
              fundamental studies  of elastomer properties.  The proposed research consists
              of a  three-pronged approach involving: 1) careful synthesis and 
              characterization; 2) use of deuterium NMR; and 3) Monte Carlo  simulations. 
              The group will use end-linking chemisty to vary the  architecture of the
              prepared networks in a systernatic way and to  examine the effect of this
              variation on the mechanical and  swelling properties of the networks. 
              Deuterium NMR experiments  will be used to probe the molecular architecture of
              the networks  and the segment orientational order parameter of networks under 
              compression.  Finally, Monte Carlo simulation methods will be  developed to
              examine the molecular structures that are obtained  after curing, the swelling
              mechanisms of the networks and the  effect of the chain stiffness of the
              precursor molecules.  Experimental results, model predictions and simulation
              results  will be compared to validate or improve existing models as well  as
              propose new models if necessary.  These studies on  poly(diethylsiloxane)
              (PDES) networks will help elucidate a long  standing issue about the nature of
              segment-segment interactions  in strained networks because PDES exhibits a
              mesophasic structure  above its glass transition.  %%%  This research is in the
              technologically important area of  elastomeric materials and networks and will
              help provide  fundamental understanding of their molecular-level structures and
               properties.  ***
