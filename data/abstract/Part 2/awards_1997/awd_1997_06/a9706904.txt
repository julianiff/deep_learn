Abstract    :
                  This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry
              Program  with a contribution from the Mathematics and Physical   Sciences
              Office of Multidisciplinary Activities for instrumentation   supports  work in
              the laboratory of Professor James Cowan in the   Department of Chemistry at
              Ohio State University.  The research will   examine and compare the Mg(II)
              binding domains of E.Coli RNase H,   exonuclease II and other proteins.  Since
              Mg(II) must be recruited from   the environment or cellular medium and binding
              affinities are often not   high, the stoichiometry of this metal cofactor
              required to effect   hydrolysis is often not well defined.  While the metal
              binding domains   show considerable variation in charge density and
              coordination for the   metal, they have comparable binding affinities.  Studies
              will focus on   calorimetric and NMR investigations of Mg binding to native and
              mutant   enzymes.  The results will form the basis for the rational design of  
              proteins with novel cation or anion binding chemistry.       This research
              involves a systematic investigation to define the   relative importance of
              Mg(II) inner and outer-sphere coordination, metal   ion charge density and
              solvation, binding affinity and other factors in   the use of Mg(II) in
              important hydrolytic enzymes.  Not only should these   studies improve our
              understanding of the role of magnesium in proteins,   but results should also
              prove highly significant  in the rational design   of ion binding sites in
              proteins.
