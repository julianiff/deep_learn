Abstract    :
              This three year project is developing and making available on the web a 
              collection of  curricula and resources for teaching undergraduate and  graduate
              networking engineering courses.  Project personnel are  establishing an
              advisory board, identifying existing materials and  soliciting new
              contributions from authors, developing appropriate formats  and editing the
              materials as required, soliciting corporate and university  partners to assist
              in making the project self-sufficient, and expanding the  existing web site and
              defining the feedback/review process.
