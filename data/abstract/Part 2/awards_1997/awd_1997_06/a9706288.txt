Abstract    :
              The Petaflops Algorithm Workshop (PAL' 97) will be held April 20-25, 1997 in 
              Williamsburg, VA.  The object of this workshop (PAL' 97) will be to identify
              novel algorithm approaches that will be significantly more efficient for key
              applications on future petaflops systems, present and evaluate results of
              federally sponsored studies in petaflops computer algorithm and also in new
              architecture point designs.  It will also determine the scope and structure of
              future government-funded algorithm research activities to ensure that  petaflop
              computers will be usable and effective for important future missions.
