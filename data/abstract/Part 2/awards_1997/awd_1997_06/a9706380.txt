Abstract    :
              9706380  Romanowicz    This research is to resolve lateral variations in 
              attenuation in the earth's mantle, which can help improve  our understanding of
              the character of upwellings in the  general mantle circulation. In recent work,
              a 3D model of  shear attenuation in the upper mantle was developed, based  on
              fundamental mode surface wave data in the spectral  domain.  The lateral
              resolution in this model is equivalent  to that of a degree 6 spherical
              harmonics expansion.  A new formalism developed for waveform inversion of
              surface  wave and body wave seismograms was applied to obtain a  degree 12 SH
              velocity model of the whole mantle.  This work  involves extending the waveform
              formalism to include off-  great-circle path propagation and inverting for
              anelastic  structure in the time domain.  This will allow a deeper  probing
              into the mantle using body wave information and  eventually increase the
              lateral resolution of the Q models.  ***
