Abstract    :
                LEE   DEB 9706317    Research will examine the effect of plants, both native
              and transgenically modified species, their rhizosphere communities and
              microbial mats on the bioremediation of sediments contaminated with high levels
              of mercury and PCBs. The project will include studies to: characterize
              (chemically, physically and biologically) the contaminated sediments; establish
              salt marsh and brackish water systems in mesocosms using the recently
              constructed Bioremediation and Environmental Research Mesocosm (BERM) facility
              at Skidaway Institute; evaluate various manipulative strategies for their
              affect on the accumulation and transformation of contaminants by plants growing
              in the mesocosms; and, test the most promising strategies from the mesocosms
              studies in the field.     The results of the research should begin to establish
              a more complete understanding of the roles of various ecosystem components on
              bioremediation under field conditions as well as test the utility of selected
              transgenic species for their use as part of a multi-component bioremediation
              methodology.
