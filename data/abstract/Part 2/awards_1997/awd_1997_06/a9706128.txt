Abstract    :
              9706128  Steeples    This research involves the understanding and controlling of
              the  shallow seismic wavefield to improve imaging in near-surface and  deeper
              exploration seismology.  Various near-surface seismic  techniques are
              increasingly useful in helping to solve  environmental, engineering, and
              resource-evaluation problems.  Recent research showed the importance of
              near-surface soil  moisture on seismic P-wave data quality.  These results will
              be  expanded to include a larger range of time and moisture  conditions, and
              extended to include three-component data and  waves other than reflected
              P-waves.  ***
