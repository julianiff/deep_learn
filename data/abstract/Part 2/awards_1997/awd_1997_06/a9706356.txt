Abstract    :
              9706356  Bilham    East Africa is breaking apart as a result of plate tectonic
              activity.  The goal of this project is to measure the velocity of east Africa
              relative to west Africa across the African Rift zone.  The speed and direction
              of easternmost Africa determines the productivity of volcanoes and earthquakes
              near the rift zone, and the formative kinematics of sedimentary oil reservoirs
              within the rift. The PI and collaborators hypothesize that east Africa slips NE
              in the same direction as India and Arabia.  In 1991 they discovered from
              measurements of historic markers in Ethiopia, that Somalia is not moving to the
              SE more than 1 m per 1000 years (a very slow rate), but they were unable to
              estimate its NE component of slip.  In 1997 the team will re-measure the very
              precise markers that were installed in 1991 in Ethiopia, and measure a
              90-year-old British survey in Uganda, both of which are sensitive to NE motion.
               The  measurements employ Global Positioning System (GPS) methods accurate to 3
              mm, permitting estimation of 1997-1991 velocities to an accuracy of 0.7
              mm/year, and 1997-1907 velocities which include less accurate traditional
              survey methods, to approximately 2 mm/year.  ***
