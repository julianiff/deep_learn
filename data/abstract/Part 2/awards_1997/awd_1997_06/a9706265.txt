Abstract    :
              9706265  Williams   The remote sensing of gas emission from volcanoes is an
              important tool for understanding processes occurring within volcanoes and for
              predicting their eruption. The correlation spectrometer, often referred to as
              the COSPEC, has been in use for monitoring sulfur dioxide gas emissions for
              almost 25 years, during which time there have been numerous modifications in
              its design, in the mode of its application in the field, and in the
              interpretation of the data measured. This award will support a five-day
              workshop that will bring together COSPEC users from most of the world's volcano
              observatories (with their instruments) in order to discuss the theory of the
              instrument, optimal methods of application suited to different natural
              circumstances, and to calibrate their instruments against a common sulfur
              dioxide emitter source.  ***
