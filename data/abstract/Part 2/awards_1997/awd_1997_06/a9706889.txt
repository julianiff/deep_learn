Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT DMS-9706889    Charles Fefferman and Elias Stein       Fefferman and
              Stein are currently working on a variety of   problems, involving techniques of
              harmonic analysis, partial   differential  equations, and micro-local analysis.
               These they   apply to such diverse  areas as quantum mechanics, turbulence,  
              pseudo-differential operators,  oscillatory integrals, analysis on  
              Heisenberg-type groups, and ergodic  theory.  These problems are   connected
              with such issues as: a conjectured  formula for the leading   correction to the
              Thomas-Fermi density; stability  of renormalized   non-relativistic quantum
              electrodynamics; energy cascade  in a   turbulent fluid; sharp decay for
              oscillatory integral operators;    effect of product-structure on estimates for
              sub-elliptic operators;   and  ergodic theorems for semi-simple Lie groups.    
              Harmonic analysis, the theme of this project, has repeatedly   proven its basic
              importance in science and technology.  It is a   fundamental tool in (for
              instance) optics, electromagnetism. quantum   mechanics, communication, and
              probability, as well as an active   research  area in core mathematics.  A
              striking recent application   of harmonic  analysis to engineering is the
              theory of wavelets, which   is now being  used in such varied domains as speech
              processing and   fingerprint identification.
