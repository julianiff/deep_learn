Abstract    :
              This project is studying software development methods to develop  general
              techniques that can be used to parameterize specific  instances of these
              methods into general methods. These general  methods will be evaluated in a
              series of experiments in order to  develop an experience base of such
              knowledge.  Software  development in the future will be based upon reuse of
              existing  products in a variety of forms. This work provides insight into  the
              relationships between reading and writing, analysis and  construction.  The
              research focuses on:  1. Developing families of techniques based upon
              understanding the  various documents used in a software development in order to
              (a)  evaluate the document itself, e.g., to report defects in the  document,
              and (b) construct other documents using an original  document as a baseline,
              e.g., to develop a new product based upon  reuse of prior products using the
              earlier documentation as a  guide to the new development.  2. Developing a set
              of evaluation methods that can be used to  assess technologies in the
              laboratory and in industrial settings.  3. Building an Experience Base of
              technique evaluations that can  be accessed by others, who can append their own
              experiences with  those techniques.
