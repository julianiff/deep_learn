Abstract    :
                    9706393  Comfort  This award is for a research symposium on the impact of 
              information technology on disaster mitigation and management.   The symposium
              will examine the current state of information  technology in disaster
              management practice and identify possible  ways to improve or increase
              interorganizational and  interjurisdictional performance through appropriate
              uses an new  applications of such technology.  Specific objectives of the 
              symposium include a demonstration of the application of a  prototype
              distributed, intelligent, spatial information system to  a set of simulated
              problems in disaster mitigation and response,  and the development of a set of
              recommendations for action  regarding the integration of information technology
              into disaster  mitigation and management practice.  Symposium participants will
               include both researchers and practitioners.  ***
