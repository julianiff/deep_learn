Abstract    :
                9706396  Coe  Flood basalts are the second most significant accumulation of
              mafic igneous material on the surface of the Earth, and their rate of eruption
              has long been considered to be three to four orders of magnitude greater than
              occurs at present-day central basaltic volcanoes. This idea depends on the
              assumption that a single flow is emplaced without significant interruption.
              Recently it has been proposed that such flows may have grown endogenously, that
              is, in a multistage process by which lava is injected into the interior of an
              already solidified flow and jacks up the top surface. If endogenous growth is a
              common mechanism of emplacement, it would reduce the enormous eruption rates
              and associated rapid production or storage of vast quantities of melt that are
              required for single-stage emplacement of very large individual lava flows
              characteristic of these provinces. Our pilot project is to test the hypothesis
              of endogenous growth by determining the magnetic fabric of the Birkett flow of
              the Columbia River Flood Basalts, for which field observations of interior
              vesicle layers have already suggested the possibility of multistage
              emplacement. Magnetic fabric analysis can detect zones where more intense shear
              occurred during flow: for multistage emplacement, two or more  shear boundaries
              should be present inside the flow. If the vesicular layers coincide with shear
              boundaries, consistent with the injection of lava after initial solidification,
              the stage will be set for a larger investigation of the role of endogenous
              growth in continental flood basalts.
