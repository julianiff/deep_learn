Abstract    :
              9706496  Knoll    The assembly and breakup of the Late Proterozoic super
              continent of Rodinia is a fundamental question of late Precambrian tectonics.
              Because the rock record of this time interval is so limited, studies of the
              well exposed rocks that do exist become all the more compelling.  In a broad
              attack of this problem, the University of New Mexico, Harvard, and MIT will
              work collaboratively on late Proterozoic  rocks of the southwestern edge of
              North America.  These investigators  will study the geological, 
              paleontological, and tectonic evolution of a sequence of sedimentary and
              volcanic rocks of Late Proterozoic age in the southwestern US.  The structural,
              sedimentological, geochronological, paleontological, and paleomagnetic data  to
              be collected will bear directly on the ages and sedimentary and tectonic
              environments of deposition  of these rocks, and at the same time examine the
              Late Proterozoic  evolution of life prior to the Cambrian diversification of
              animal life.
