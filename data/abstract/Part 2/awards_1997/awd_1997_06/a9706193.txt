Abstract    :
              9706193  Butler   The Andean convergent margin exhibits a distinct bend centered
              at about 20o  south latitude, coincident with the Altiplano region.  Several
              models can possibly account for this bend, including oroclinal bending. 
              Preliminary paleomagnetic data indicates that vertical-axis rotations have
              affected Cenozoic rocks units in the central Andes as far inboard as the
              eastern Cordillera of  Bolivia.  These are generally counterclockwise on the
              north limb and clock wise on the south limb of the bend.  However, the temporal
              distribution of these rotations are poorly known.  The goals of this project
              are to determine the pre-Neogene component of oroclinal bending and to define
              the extent and style of Eocene and Oligocene-Early Miocene deformation,
              including regional crustal domains and the fault that bound them.  As well as
              providing important insights in the geodynamic development  of the Altiplano,
              successful completion of this project would add significantly to knowledge of
              oroclinal structures, rotations associated with boundaries of crustal domains,
              and the structural development of fold and thrust belts in oroclines.
