Abstract    :
                Abstract  9706057  Bergelson/Leibman    This project will investigate problems
              of multiple recurrence and convergence with the emphasis on the behavior of
              dynamical systems along polynomials.  The recurrence problems considered are
              tied to problems in combinatorial number theory and set theory and the results
              can be used to prove the existence of patterns with the conventional methods of
              classical analysis, combinatorics and number theory fail to discern.  The PIs
              recently proved that the ergodic polynomial Szemeredi theorem extends to
              operators generating a nilpotent group.  This naturally leads to more general
              questions and conjectures about multiple recurrence for nilpotent group
              actions.    This grant is to fund the study of the long term behavior of
              dynamical systems and stochastic processes.  Many important physical phenomena,
              as varied as the behavior of the stock market, lines in the supermarket, and
              data being received from a distant transmission source, exhibit locally erratic
              behavior which can be understood better by looking at the long term average
              behavior instead.  The study of such stochastic processes and their connections
              with one another, as well as their connections in terms of their fine structure
              with other less random processes, is a central one in modern mathematics.  It
              is only through such studies that we will be able to understand better and thus
               be able to control or predict the evolution of the physical phenomena which
              this mathematics can model.
