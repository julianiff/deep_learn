Abstract    :
              9706693  Magenheim  Crater lakes, perched atop active volcanoes, act as natural
              condensers of magmatic volatiles and integrate volatile element (Cl, S, F,
              among others) and heat fluxes over periods of passive degassing.  This study
              will assess the chlorine stable isotope ratios associated with the volcanogenic
              flux of Cl to EarthOs surface through the analysis of crater lake fluids.  A
              survey of geographically and tectonically distinct crater lakes, as well as, an
              assessment of the temporal variations in several well studies caldera lakes
              (Yugama, Poas, and Ruapehu) will be included.  The primary objectives are: 1)
              to estimate the isotopic ratios of Cl presently being degassed to EarthOs
              Surface reservoir through the survey of Cl trapped in crater lake systems from
              around the world, 2) to investigate the potential for isotope fractionation
              occurring during magmatic degassing through the time-series studies, and 3) to
              address the origin of the Cl being supplied to the crater lakes, specifically
              whether the Cl is derived from the surface reservoirs or from deeper, within
              the mantle.
