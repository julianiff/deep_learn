Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  ATM 9706016  CHIDONG ZHANG  U MIAMI  TITLE: Large-Scale Variability of
              Atmospheric Deep Convection in the Western  Pacific Warm Pool    The objective
              of the study that this grant is supporting is to improve our  understanding of
              large scale variability of atmospheric deep convection and the role of 
              atmospheric deep convection in air sea interaction in the Western Pacific Warm
              Pool  (WPWP).  The achievement of this research will provide observational
              evidence that  is needed for  enhancing our knowledge of air sea interaction.  
               The research proposed will conduct diagnostic studies on the convection,  MJO
              and  ocean interaction.  Both COARE and TAO data sets will be analyzed for this
              purpose.   This research will enhance our understanding of the MJO and the
              physics of ocean  atmosphere coupling over the Pacific Warm Pool (PWP).
