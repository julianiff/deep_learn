Abstract    :
              9706692  Mosher  A leading problem in understanding the late Proterozoic of
              North America  relates to the Grenville orogeny and its relationship to the
              crustal blocks involved in it. South of the great lakes exposure of the
              relevant rocks is almost non-existent, and thus the exposures of the Llano
              uplift, and those in west Texas become unusually critical in deciphering these
              relationships. In fact, the exposures that do exist there seem to reveal a
              rather more complicated history of not only typical lower crustal Grenville
              rocks, but also eclogites, possible fragments of the mid continental
              Grainte-Rhyolite terrane, and a so-far unrecognized volcanic terrane.  This
              geochronological, petrological, and structural study  of these rocks will
              provide fundamental limiting and defining data that will strongly constrain our
              understanding of the tectonic evolution of the southern Grenville region.
