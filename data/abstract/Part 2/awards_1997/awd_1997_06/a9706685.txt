Abstract    :
              The phenomenal growth of the World Wide Web is imposing  considerable strain on
              Internet resources and Web servers,  prompting numerous concerns about the
              Web's continued viability.  The success of high-performance Web servers in
              alleviating  these performance problems is ultimately limited, unless Web 
              services are designed to be inherently scalable.  The  Commonwealth project
              aims to design, implement, and evaluate a  prototypical architecture and a set
              of associated protocols for  scalable Web services.  The Commonwealth
              architecture for hosting  scalable Web services allows scalability through (1)
              parallel  processing on tightly-coupled nodes within a Web site, and (2)  load
              distribution across loosely-coupled Web sites.  Commonwealth's underlying
              philosophy is to achieve a WEALTH of  performance through the use of COMMON
              components, and to do so  along an incremental upgrade path.    The
              Commonwealth protoype will catalyze basic research in four  main areas: (1)
              Data placement (caching, prefetching, and  dissemination protocols); (2)
              Resource management (scheduling,  load balancing, and admission control
              protocols); (3) Networking  (routing, packet redirection, and connection
              migration) and (4)  Middleware services (replication and resource discovery). 
              These  problems will be addressed with particular attention to the issue  of
              high-variability, which---in  previous work by the principal 
              investigators---was shown to pose significant problems for the  design of
              Internet-based systems.
