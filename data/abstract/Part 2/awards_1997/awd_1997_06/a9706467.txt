Abstract    :
              9706467  Stute     One of the key questions in paleoclimate research is the
              degree of symmetry and the mechanisms of climate change on both hemispheres. 
              We plan to address this issue by improving the continental climate record for
              the last glacial period in South America.  We will primarily use the
              concentrations of atmospheric noble gases dissolved in 14C dated groundwater
              which is used as archive of climate change.   We request funds for collection
              and evaluation of geochemical data (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, 14C, 13C, D, 18O, 34S,
              3H and major dissolved ions) from two groundwater flow systems in South
              America, the Botucatu aquifer in Brazil, and the Bahia Blanca aquifer in
              Argentina.  Noble gas paleotemperature records from these aquifers will provide
              quantitative reconstruction of paleotemperatures for South America covering the
              past 35,000 years.  These two records will complete a glacial paleotemperature
              north-south transect along the Americas based on 'noble gas temperatures'
              archived in groundwater flow systems.  The transect will (1) allow us to
              address the interhemipheric symmetry of long-term climate change, (2) provide a
              firmer footing for presently used paleoclimatic proxies, and (3) help us to
              better understand the coupling of climate change between the northern and
              southern hemispheres.  This work contributes directly to the goals of IGBP
              through PEP I, a subprogram of PAGES.  Additionally, we request funds for
              studies of some new methodological aspects of noble gas thermometry which were
              documented in the framework of our previous paleoclimate studies.
