Abstract    :
              9706255  Louie  There is a large debate over the possibility of generating
              regionally extensive, large-magnitude  extensional faults  at moderate to
              shallow depths. Indeed, most shallow faults can be shown from a variety of
              methods to be steeply dipping. This study has identified the Dixie Valley fault
              system as having a high potential to be active and shallow, and the data to be
              collected should be able to discriminate between competing hypotheses.  If the
              fault can be shown to be active and of low dip, it will have a significant 
              impact on the models of both active and ancient deformation in extensional
              regimes.
