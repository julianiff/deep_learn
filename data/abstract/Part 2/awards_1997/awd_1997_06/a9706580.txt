Abstract    :
              9706580  Kohlstedt    The PI proposes a study that will contribute to our
              understanding of the frictional behavior of rocks, particularly the deformation
              processes occurring at asperities between sliding rock surfaces.  Insight into
              this process will be elucidated from an experimental investigation of the  
              deformation mechanisms and rheology at a single asperity sliding on the surface
              of the same or a different mineral.  By examining the frictional response at a
              single asperity, the PI can directly interpret the measured mechanical
              properties in terms of the observed microstructural damage.   Experiments will
              be performed on a suite of minerals including olivine, calcite and halite
              surfaces which exhibit a range of brittleness versus plasticity at room
              temperature.  Both static indentation and dynamic scratch experiments will be
              carried out using two unique   micro/nanomechanical testing apparatuses that
              have been recently developed.    The partitioning of strain between brittle
              fracture and plastic flow processes and the dependence of this partitioning on
              slip rate, penetration rate and humidity will be determined.  The coefficient
              of friction in slide-hold-slide tests and velocity-step tests to constrain its
              evolution   will also be measured.  Microstructures will be characterized using
              optical, scanning electron, transmission electron, and atomic force microscopy
              techniques.  ***
