Abstract    :
              9706062  Heizler    This grant provides $49,055 as one-half support of the costs
              of  acquiring a UV laser ablation system for the Ar/Ar 
              geochronology/thermochronology lab at New Mexico Tech.  A UV  laser will allow
              these PI's to conduct in situ 40-Ar/39-Ar  analyses on spot sizes as small as
              50 microns, allowing for  higher resolution studies than currently achievable
              with their  CO2 laser used for step-heating and total fusion analyses. The  use
              of a UV laser coupled with rare gas mass spectrometery has a  great deal of
              potential for dating and geochemical analyses of  individual fluid inclusions,
              dating alteration phases and  overgrowths in economic mineral deposits and for
              studies of micro-  scale Ar diffusion systematics and undoubtedly will be
              heavily  used by these productive PI's.  ***
