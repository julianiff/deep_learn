Abstract    :
              9706473  Spear  The goal of this  project is to collect data on the distribution
              of trace elements in garnet and coexisting metamorphic minerals from two
              localities - western New Hampshire and western Maine. This data will be
              integrated with observations of the major element zoning and reaction history
              analysis using different thermodynamics algorithms (Gibbs method)  modified to
              incorporate trace elements. Trace element zoning will be characterized using
              the electron and ion microprobe. Two- and three-dimensional x-ray maps will
              also be obtained. Progressive metamorphism will be modeled as an equilibrium
              recrystallization process and predictions made of the zoning in garnet. PI will
              also evaluate the extent to which equilibrium is attained as trace elements
              partition during metamorphic reactions through garnet and staurolite zones.
