Abstract    :
              9706629  Duke  This project will examine potential applications of spectroscopic
              methods to supplement traditional methods of field mapping to extend the
              results of modern laboratory analysis to regional-scale,
              high-spatial-resolution maps of metamorphic terranes. It is proposed that
              spectroscopic methods can be used to produce maps of mineral distribution, maps
              of relative or absolute mineral abundance, and amaps of chemical variation.
              Tasks include: (1) forward modeling of simple metamorphic reactions using
              library mineral spectra to evaluate the spectral response of metamorphic
              processes, (2) inverse modeling of spectra of synthetic mixtures and natural
              rocks to evaluate and improve the accuracy of spectral decomposition methods
              for estimating mineral abundance, (3) correlation of mineral-chemical
              variations with spectral adsorption band shifts to evaluate the sensitivity of
              spectroscopy, (4) conduct new field studies to test results of tasks 1-3, (5)
              evaluate the applicability of spectroscopic methods to low-grade metamorphism
              through analysis of synthetic mixtures, natural samples, and field studies and
              (6) convolve model and real rock spectra to spectral resolutions of current and
              planned remote sensing spectrometers to evaluate the sensitivity of different
              sensors to metamorphic processes. The greatest impact of this research will be
              to develop the framework for integrating these new techniques into the study of
              metamorphic processes.
