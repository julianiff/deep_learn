Abstract    :
              9706185  Morgan  Ore deposits do not form randomly throughout the EarthOs
              history, but develop in response to the coming together of very specific
              geologic conditions, largely controlled by plate tectonics and the melting of 
              rocks in the EarthOs deep crust and underlying mantle layer.  Knowing the
              three-dimensional regional and local geology in combination with the precise
              ages for geologic events that led to mineralization, markedly improves the
              scientistOs ability to predict areas where buried ore deposits might be
              present.  In this study, the 187Re-187Os isotopic system will be used for
              dating mineral pairs such as pyrite and molybdenite in order to elucidate the
              timing of gold mineralization that, in turn, help constrain the mechanism for
              discerning multiple magmatic and hydrothermal events at any single locality. 
              This project will focus on gold deposits formed early in EarthOs history, some
              2.0 to 3.0 billion years ago during Archean time, and it is expected that the
              results will shed light on the controversy surrounding the timing and duration
              of world-renowned gold mineralization at that time.
