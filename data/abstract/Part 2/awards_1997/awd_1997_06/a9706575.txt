Abstract    :
              9706575  Holzwarth    This grant will support research on computational
              techniques  and their application to various materials systems.  The 
              computational tools are based on first principles techniques  integrating
              algorithms established in the literature with  various innovations.  They are
              based on the Car-Parinello  technique.  The density functional portion of the
              algorithm  uses a modified version of the projector augmented-wave  method,
              introduced by Blochl, which incorporates the  numerical efficiency of the
              pseudopotential approach while  retaining the important physical effects of an
              all-electron  calculation.  The completed code will be shared with other 
              researchers.    The simulations will include: a study of structural  relaxation
              in the (001) surface of cubic SiC; a study of two  interacting surfaces with a
              view toward an idealized model  of tunneling and force microscopes; a study of
              static and  dynamic point defects in calcium fluoride and related  materials
              which affect their use as radiation detectors and  optical windows; and, a
              longer term project to study the  interaction of water with metal surfaces. 
              %%%  The award will support research on both computer code  development and its
              application to various problems in  materials physics.  The code development
              will benefit all  researchers by being made readily available.  The 
              computational research will focus on problems having to do  with electronic and
              structural properties of defects in  solids and on the properties of surfaces.
