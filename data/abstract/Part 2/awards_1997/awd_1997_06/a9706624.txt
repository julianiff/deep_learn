Abstract    :
              97-06624  Mao     The PIs propose new experiments on the elasticity and
              equations of state of mantle and core materials (eg. periclase, stishovite,
              ringwoodite, majorite, Mg-Fe silicate perovskite, FeO, Fe) to address a broad
              range of problems in geophysics.  Recently developed techniques, including new 
               diamond-anvil cell (DAC) design, high-temperature laser-heating and
              resistive-heating techniques, synchrotron single-crystal and polycrystal x-ray
              diffraction, and Brillouin scattering spectroscopic techniques will be used to
              study a wide array of materials of importance in studies of earth's mantle and
              core.  ***
