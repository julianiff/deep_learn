Abstract    :
              Abstract  ATMP-9706921  Mayewski, Paul A., and Meeker, Loren D.  University of
              New Hampshire  History of forcing Significance of GISP2 Record    There is
              growing recognition of the special "window on the past" provided by ice cores. 
              In particular, completion of deep drilling at Summit Greenland has presented
              paleoclimatologists with a well-dated, high resolution, multi-parameter record
              which is providing an unprecedented view of climate change over the last
              glacial/interglacial cycle.  This award supports a project focused on:  (1)
              developing even more robust descriptions of paleoclimate utilizing the
              multivariate (e.g., isotopes, particles, chemistry) GISP2 record; (2) utilizing
              the GISP2 as a framework for comparison with other paleoclimate records; (3)
              developing proxy records for atmospheric circulation systems in order to
              investigate seasonal-to-interannual and decadal-to centennial scale
              variability; (4) investigating and interpreting changes in the sources and
              production rates of the chemical species recorded in the GISP2 record in order
              to contribute to our understanding of biogeochemical cycling; (5) enhancing our
              understanding of the complex behavior of Holocene climate through the detailing
              of Holocene climate change (e.g., changes in atmospheric circulation, aridity,
              biological activity) and forcing; (6) investigating analogs for near-Holocene
              climate including interstadials, Eem and transitions into and out of stadials
              to further elucidate Holocene climate response and forcing; (7) investigating
              global phasing of climate change events; (8) investigating natural versus
              anthropogenic forcing of climate to enhance prediction of future climate and;
              (9) interpreting the preceding in light of the human dimensions of climatic
              change.
