Abstract    :
              9706152  Okal      This research is to extend a highly successful project to
              recover seismic data from analog recordings of deep earthquakes prior to the
              digital Global Seismic Network installation.  Prior work concentrated on
              earthquakes in the depth range of 300-700 km prior to 1976.  This effort will
              concentrate on deep events between 125-300 km in depth.  Thus, the Harvard
              University focal mechanism catalogue will be extended back in time to increase
              significantly the statistical sampling density in time and space.  Focal
              mechanism inversions will be done on the back-projected data using the same
              Harvard algorithm.  It is envisioned that about 200 new centroid moment tensor
              solutions will be obtained;  this would double the size of the data set of
              reliable, quantitative estimates of earthquake sources in the relevant windows
              of depth and size.  These new results will provide powerful new insight into
              problems such as the origin of faulting in intermediate depth earthquakes in
              relation to mineralogical transformations, their distribution in space and time
              in relation to local geological features, and improve our understanding of
              their recurrence patterns, an especially important topic, since several
              intermediate earthquakes have resulted in severe loss of life.  This research
              is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
