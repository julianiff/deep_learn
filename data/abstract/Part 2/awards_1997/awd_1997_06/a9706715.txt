Abstract    :
              9706715  Lion  This is a renewal of support for research initiated under NSF 
              Grant No. 86-17408 and continued under 91-00209 to characterize  the role that
              transition metals have on hazards to environmental  health because of their
              toxicity, potential for bioaccumulation  and their persistence in the
              environment.  Chemical equilibrium  models integrated with mathematical models
              that resulted from  prior research will be extended in this project to account
              for  biological interactions with iron oxides that control iron  cycling and
              subsequent adsorption of environmentally significant  trace metals.  The
              research includes consideration of biological  processes that affect deposition
              of iron, the effects that  bacterial and algal cells and their extracellular
              polymers have  on adsorption of lead by iron oxides, and amelioration of metal 
              toxicity to microorganisms by the presence of iron.  The research  involves
              laboratory investigations with controlled chemical  conditions necessary to
              characterize important biotic and abiotic  components that will be used to
              guide field studies.    Results of this research are expected to be an improved
               understanding from that which now exists of the behavior and fate  of metals
              that pollute and contaminate natural surface and  groundwaters.  Knowledge
              gained from this research and the  resultant mathematical models may be applied
              in engineering  design of processes and treatment systems for removal of metal 
              contaminants from polluted and contaminated natural surface water  supplies,
              groundwater, and from domestic and industrial  wastewaters prior to their
              discharge into the environment.  ***
