Abstract    :
              9706644    Zhou    The project includes the study of Sobolev space bijectivity
              of  inverse scattering transforms, long time asymptotics for  integrable
              systems related to Riemann-Hilbert problems on Riemann surfaces,  the zero
              dispersion problem for focusing NLS, infinite dimensional  perturbation theory
              for integrable systems, certain integrable statistical  models--random
              matrices--orthogonal polynomials, and other problems related  to inverse
              scattering theory.     The inverse scattering theory provides a method for
              analyzing many nonlinear  phenomena of mathematical and scientific importance
              described by so-called   integrable systems. Many of these systems originated
              from statistical  physics and nonlinear optics. For instance, the focusing NLS
              equation is  a model for soliton transmission in optical fibres, which may be 
              adopted by industry for the new generation of information transmission  
              systems. This project aims at further developments of certain mathematical
              tools  originated by the PI and his collaborators. These tools allow one to
              obtain  very detailed information on the solutions of integrable systems and  a
              deeper understanding  of the related nonlinear phenomena.
