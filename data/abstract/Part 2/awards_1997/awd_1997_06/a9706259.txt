Abstract    :
              9706259  Smith    Hydrologic and hydrometeorolgical analyses will be carried out
              for 12 storms and their associated floods.  Analyses will be modeled after
              studies of the Rapidan Storm flooding of June 27, 1995 along the east slope of
              the Virginia Blue Ridge (see Smith et al., Catastrophic rainfall from an
              upslope thunderstorm in the central Appalachians, Water Resources Research,
              1996). In particular, hydrometeorological analyses for each event will be based
              on volume scan reflectivity and Doppler observations from the network of
              WSR-88D (Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler) radars.  For each event, rain
              gage and streamflow data sets will be compiled and used, together with radar
              and conventional meteorological observations, to construct atmospheric and land
              surface water budgets.  Lagrangian analyses of storm structure, motion and
              evolution will also be carried out for each of the 12 storms. These analyses
              will be used to examine the dominant storm-scale properties for heavy rain-fall
              production.   Drainage basin characteristics for the regions affected by
              extreme flooding exhibit striking contrasts for the events to be studied,
              ranging from the low-gradient environment of southeastern Texas, to the
              high-gradient central Appalachian region, to heavily urbanized catchments. 
              Events include the Dallas Hailstorm, which resulted in 16 flash flood deaths
              during a period of approximately 1 hour, Hurricane Fran, which produced 500
              year magnitude flood peaks in high-gradient basins of the central Appalachians,
              and the southeastern Texas storms of October 1994 that produced catastrophic
              flooding in Kickapoo Creek and downstream sections of the Trinity River basin.
