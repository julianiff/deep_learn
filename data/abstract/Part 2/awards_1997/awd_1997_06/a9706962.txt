Abstract    :
              In recent years CPU execution speed has increased at a much greater rate than 
              DRAM access speed.  This disparity has produced a large speed penalty for
              access  to memory by today's computer systems, which may reach several hundred 
              instructions within a few years.  Performance of future computer systems may be
               limited by this effect to the speed of memory rather than the speed of logic. 
                This project investigates a new memory architecture which reduces the speed
              gap.   By integrating a small, wide cache on each DRAM IC, expected DRAM access
              time  will be reduced.  By employing dedicated high-performance connections
              between  processor and memory, memory-bus latency will be eliminated.  Finally,
              by  incorporating hardware to predict memory access and prefetch data, DRAM
              latency  will be further hidden.  These innovations will be evaluated using 
              architectural-level simulations based on traces of memory-intensive programs.
