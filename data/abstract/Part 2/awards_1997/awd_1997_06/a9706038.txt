Abstract    :
                    Shubin  proposes to study L^2 holomorphic functions and L^2  Dolbeault 
              cohomology  on non-compact manifolds with boundary. He will use Von  Neumann
              algebra techniques to further develop  the L^2 Oka-Grauert   theory on complex
              manifolds M with pseudoconvex or q-convex boundary bM    admitting a
              holomorphic action of a Lie group G on M with a compact  quotient M/G.  He
              plans to investigate existence of non-trivial L^2  holomorphic functions on M
              for concrete Lie groups G which act    freely on M with compact quotient M/G. 
              In this way it might be   possible to describe the class of groups G for which
              the existence of  non-trivial  L^2 holomorphic functions is guaranteed.  The
              situation when there is no group action will   be also considered with the
              purpose  of finding geometric conditions  which guarantee existence of
              non-trivial L^2 holomorphic  functions.         Techniques from several complex
              variables are similar to those  appearing  in linear and non-linear  partial
              differential equations that  describe  cosmological models (through twistors)
              and  free boundary  problems, providing models for plasma in tokamaks by 
              methods of   Helmholtz and Kirchhoff.  Investigation of these models can lead
              to   important discoveries  in thermonuclear reactions  which are our main hope
              for the future source of cheap energy.
