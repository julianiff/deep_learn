Abstract    :
                This project would seek improved estimates of the solar wind  polytropic index
              at the bow shock to be obtained by analyzing shock  crossing data with improved
              MHD-based models for the bow shock.   The project will additionally seek
              analytic solutions for the  magnetosheath thickness and related parameters and
              determine their  dependence on solar wind and magnetopause parameters.  The
              results  of these investigations will be compared with MHD simulations with 
              the goal to improve the understanding of the large scale physics of  the
              magnetosheath and the size and shape of the bow shock.
