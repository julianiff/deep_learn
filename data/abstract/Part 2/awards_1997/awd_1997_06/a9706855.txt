Abstract    :
              9706855    Wang    Work on this project concerns several analytic problems
              arising   from the area of geometric variational calculus: weakly   harmonic
              maps, weak flows of harmonic maps into general   Riemannian manifolds,
              p-harmonic maps. Smoothness of solutions to   such problems often breaks down.
              Of particular interest are the   partial regularity and uniqueness of weak
              flows of harmonic maps   in suitable classes, sequential compactness of the
              solution space   including weakly harmonic maps and weak flows of harmonic
              maps,  relationships between flows of Ginzburg-Landau type and   harmonic maps,
              behavior of solutions near singular points, and  existence and geometric
              properties of self-similar solutions to   harmonic map flows. This work will
              involve geometric measure   theory and PDE methods in geometric fashion. The PI
              also proposes   to formulate heat flow of harmonic maps between Alexandrov
              spaces.     Partial differential equations are the basic tools to describe  
              physical problems. Harmonic maps model extremal (or optimal)   objects with
              respect to physically natural energy functionals  in families of objects
              satisfying common constraints. The heat  flow of harmonic maps studies the
              long-time dynamical behavior  of objects in such families.  The study will
              enhance our   understanding of these maps, improve methods to control the 
              singular sets, and predict singular behavior of solutions to  these problems.
              The results will have applications to material  science including liquid
              crystals and elasticity/plasticity.
