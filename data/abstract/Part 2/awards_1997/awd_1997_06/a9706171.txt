Abstract    :
              9706171  Creager    This research is to analyze seismic phase data already
              gathered that relate to anisotropy of the inner core and the structure of the
              lowermost mantle.  Earlier work was instrumental in the discovery of the
              anisotropy of the inner core.  Refinement of the structure with more data will
              allow more details of the velocity structure to be seen and to investigate
              time-dependence of models of motion of the inner core relative to the mantle. 
              Refinement of structure in the lowermost mantle will be done using a
              combination of core seismic phases and ScS-S and sScS-sS differential times.
