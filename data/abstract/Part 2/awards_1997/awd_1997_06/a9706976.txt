Abstract    :
              9706976  Hartshorn  This renewal award is to conduct Phase III of the Arthropods
              of La Selva (ALAS) survey; Phases I and II were also funded by the Biotic
              Surveys & Inventories Program in partnership with the International Program of
              NSF. As this Phase is finished, ALAS will be sufficiently near completion that
              other types of studies (monographic and ecological) can be conducted on the
              organisms discovered by ALAS.  Since 1991, the project has built scientific
              infrastructure (both physical and in terms of human resources) in Costa Rica,
              formed strong partnerships with the Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad of
              Costa Rica, databased and prepared 84,000 specimens of arthropods collected at
              La Selva, and designed and published a specimen-level database application
              (Biota).  Results of the project are being published as WWW information
              resources (http://viceroy.eeb.uconn.edu/ALAS/ALAS.html).  This phase of funding
              will support continued species discovery, distribution of specimens to a
              variety of specialists, productive use of the infrastructure that is already in
              place, and innovative use of emerging technologies to increase efficiency of
              data capture and dissemination.
