Abstract    :
              9706609  Garnero    This research is to investigate simultaneous determination
              of lower mantle shear wave heterogeneity and anisotropy.  Attention will be
              devoted to lateral and depth distribution of variability in these properties,
              where possible.  Both anisotropy and heterogeneity can be determined with the
              same data set, the S wave train at epicentral distances beyond 85 degrees. 
              Determination of lower mantle heterogeneity will provide regionally appropriate
              reference structures from which estimates of anisotropy can be made, and then
              related to large scale mantle circulation as well as possible localized
              convection patterns/currents.  ***
