Abstract    :
              9706054  Wiedenbeck    This grant provides $160,000 as two years of facility
              support for  the University of New Mexico/Sandia National Laboratory Ion 
              Microprobe Facility.  This grant is a renewal of current EAR/IF  support
              (EAR-9506611) of this facility.  The UNM/SNL facility  provides access to a
              Cameca ims 4f secondary ion microprobe  (SIMS) for 50% of the operational time
              of this instrument.  The  remaining instrument time is allocated to DOE/SNL
              researchers as  DOE provides laboratory space and originally purchased the 
              instrument.  Specifically, funds will provide half-time salary  support and
              associated fringe and indirect costs for a senior  researcher and a research
              associate and laboratory consumables.  This facility provides high spatial
              resolution trace element  analyses of geologic and planetary materials for
              studies in  igneous and planetary petrology and geochemistry.  Development of 
              analytical techniques for isotopic measurements are underway.  ***
