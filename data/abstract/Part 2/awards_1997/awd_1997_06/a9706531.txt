Abstract    :
              9706531  Lancaster    Vegetation plays an important role in determining the
              dynamics and morphology of desert and coastal sand dune environments via its
              influence on the entrainment and transport of sand by the wind.  Many of these
              environments are sensitive to climate change and variability as well as human
              impacts such as grazing, off-road vehicles, and recreational use.    This
              research develops an empirical model of relations between sand transport rates
              and the cover and geometry of natural dryland vegetation based on field studies
              of boundary layer winds, vegetation characteristics, and direct measurements of
              sand transport rates in vegetated areas are investigated through an assessment
              of the partitioning of shear stress between the vegetation and the intervening
              surface and by high frequency measurements of temporal and spatial variations
              in sand movement in relation to the gustiness and turbulence intensity of near
              surface winds.    Based on field data, empirical models are developed that can
              be used to:(1) predict the effects of climate change and variability on sand
              transport rates in vegetated sandy areas; and (2) guide environmental
              restoration programs in such areas.
