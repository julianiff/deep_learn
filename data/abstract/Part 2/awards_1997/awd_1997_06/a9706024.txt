Abstract    :
              9706024  Drake  This project addresses the geochemistry of highly siderophile
              elements in silicate systems of Earth's interior.  The PIs will carry out an
              experimental program to investigate the solubility and mineral/melt
              partitioning behavior of noble siderophile elements.  The major scientific
              goals are to quantify:  (1) the geochemical behavior of Re and Os, elements
              important for chronology and as tracers of planetary evolution; (2) the
              geochemical behavior  of  the platinum group elements in general.  The PIs will
              target the Re-Os isotopic system and conduct systematic studies if crystal/melt
              partitioning of Re and Os.  A second approach involves systematic solubility
              investigations to quantify the chemical controls on highly siderophile element
              solubilities in lithophile phases.  Experiments will be carried out in
              one-atmosphere gas-mixing furnaces, piston-cylinder apparatus, and multi-anvil
              apparatus.
