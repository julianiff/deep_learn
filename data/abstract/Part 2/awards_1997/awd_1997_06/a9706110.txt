Abstract    :
              9706110  Williams      This project involves a workshop which will bring
              together a  collaborative group of U.S., Colombian and Ecuadorian scientists 
              whose interests involve the regional tectonics, and volcanic  processes and
              hazards in the northern Andes.  The focus of the  Workshop will be for all
              involved to learn what research has been  done, what resources are available,
              what are the local logistical  concerns and to plan a strategy for future
              research.    ***
