Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT    Lacey DMS-9706884    Lacey, in collaboration with C. Thiele,
              has made substantial   progress towards settling the conjecture of Alberto
              Calderon   concerning the boundedness of the bilinear Hilbert transform   from
              L^2 times L^2 into L^1.  Lacey and Thiele will work  on  developing a more 
              complete understanding of the theory  of bilinear singular integrals.  Their 
              method of proof can be  refined to the point at which three significant aspects
              of   harmonic analysis can be understood from the same group of   basic
              principles.  They are the Cauchy integral on Lipschitz   curves, Carleson's
              Theorem on the pointwise convergence   of Fourier series and bilinear singular
              integrals and maximal   functions. The method of proof is based on a novel use
              of   phase plane tecniques.  The applications of these techniques  to other
              questions will be explored.      A musical score is a representation of the
              music built around   temporal and frequency aspects.  A phase plane analysis is
              an   adaptive counterpart of the musical score. The hallmark of such   an
              analysis is precisely that of a musical score, a high degree   of localization
              in time and frequency variables.  This proposal   pursues the study of phase
              plane analysis and its applications   to operators in Harmonic Analysis which
              are   difficult to compute   due to their non--local nature. Harmonic Analyisis
              provides  the mathematical foundation for Signal Processing, most recently 
              popularized by the theory of wavelets.
