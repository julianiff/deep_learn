Abstract    :
              9706517  Rapp  This experimental study on the geochemical effects of deep
              subduction of the oceanic crust has two parts.  The first aspect is to place
              experimental constraints on the linked processes of tonalite-trondhjemite
              granodiorite plutonism and cratonization.   A series of multi-anvil experiments
              on hydrous natural basalts will be conducted in the pressure range 4-8 GPa at
              900-1200oC, to complement existing experimental data at 1-3 GPa.  Objectives
              include defining the wet basalt solidus in this range, determining the
              compositions of the phases in the hydrous melt-eclogite restite assemblage, and
              estimating the trace element mineral-melt partition coefficients in order to
              constrain the geochemical characteristics of eclogite residues of partial
              melting.  The second aspect of the proposal aims to examine the geochemical
              changes oceanic crust undergoes as it subducts beyond the island arc regime
              into the transition zone, again by conducting phase equilibria experiments on
              hydrous basalt in the multi-anvil apparatus.  This aspect will be addressed by
              defining the general phase relations for hydrous basalt in the P-T range 4-20
              GPa and 900-1300oC, and then focusing on trace element systematics in garnet,
              clinopyroxene, and their solid solutions in natural basalt compositions as a
              function of pressure.
