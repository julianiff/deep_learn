Abstract    :
              9706329  Karato    The PI proposes to provide new experimental constraints on
              the  geodynamical interpretation of seismic anisotropy in upper mantle 
              minerals.  The focus will be on the role of water and of dynamic 
              recrystallization.  Simple shear deformation techniques developed  in the PI's
              laboratory will be used in the experiments and  electron backscatter pattern
              analysis (EBSP) will be utilized to  investigate lattice preferred orientation.
               Synthetic  polycrystalline specimens of upper mantle minerals will be 
              prepared and deformed to large strains (~100-300 %) at high  temperature and
              pressure in simple shear under water-rich and  water-poor conditions.  The
              microstructural development including  the lattice preferred orientation will
              be investigated by the EBSP  technique and seismic anisotropy corresponding to
              specific  deformation mechanisms and deformation geometry will be predicted. 
              The results will be compared with seismological observations to  place new
              constraints on the flow pattern in the upper mantle.  ***
