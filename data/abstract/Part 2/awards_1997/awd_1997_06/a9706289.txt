Abstract    :
              9706289  Burnley    The goal of this investigation is to develop improved
              mechanical  models of the internal stresses and strains caused by nucleation 
              and growth of dense transition zone phases, wadsleyite and  ringwoodite, in
              olivine.  There is much evidence to argue that  the mechanical response of  the
              host olivine influences kinetics and fabric development  during transformation.
               These mechanical effects should be most  profound in low temperature
              environments within subducting  lithospheric slabs where olivine is relatively
              strong.  Phase  transformation and the resulting  metamorphic fabrics it
              produces can have a strong influence on  the behavior of a subducting slab
              because transformation in the  slab determines its relative buoyancy as well as
              its strength.  The PIs will develop numerical models of the mechanical 
              interactions between parent and  daughter phases during transformation, guided
              by observations of  experimentally produced transformation microstructures
              collected  over a wide range of pressure, temperature and stress conditions.
