Abstract    :
              Abstract  Sinai  9706794    Sinai will work in three directions:  1. Qualitative
              behavior of solutions of some quasi-linear systems with or without randomness -
              in particular, pressure-less equations of gas dynamics, the creation of
              singularities of types of shocks, and concentration of masses on submanifolds
              of small dimensions; 2. Twist maps with strong statistical properties - in
              particular, the construction of twist maps with positive Lyapunov exponents;
              and 3. Problems related to quantum chaos and ensembles of random matrices - in
              particular, the universality of distributions found earlier by Wigner, Dyson
              and others.    This grant is to fund the study of the long term behavior of
              dynamical systems and stochastic processes.  Many important physical phenomena,
              as varied as the behavior of the stock market, lines in the supermarket, and
              data being received from a distant transmission source, exhibit locally erratic
              behavior which can be understood better by looking at the long term average
              behavior instead.  The study of such stochastic processes and their connections
              with one another, as well as their connections in terms of their fine structure
              with other less random processes, is a central one in modern mathematics.  It
              is only through such studies that we will be able to understand better and thus
               be able to control or predict the evolution of the physical phenomena which
              this mathematics can model.
