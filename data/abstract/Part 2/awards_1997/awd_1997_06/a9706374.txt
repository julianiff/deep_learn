Abstract    :
              9706374  Burgmann    This project will establish an InSAR (Interferometric
              Synthetic Aperture Radar) data analysis center at UC Davis to study active
              crustal deformation in two target areas, the San Francisco Bay region,
              California, along a complex juncture of the San Andreas fault system, and the
              strain accumulation zone along the Greater Himalaya in central Asia.  The
              measurements complement GPS (Global Positioning System) and leveling data to
              better constrain models of the active deformation processes.  The analysis of
              interseismic faulting and strain accumulation will lead to improved
              understanding of the earthquake hazards in the target areas.  Results from this
              investigation will include detailed mapping of the complex distribution of
              creeping and locked segments along the San Andreas fault system, a better model
              of the distribution of strain among the interacting faults of the San Francisco
              Bay region, and a better definition of the strain accumulation zone near the
              down-dip edge of M>8 earthquake rupture zones along the Himalaya.  ***
