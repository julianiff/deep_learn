Abstract    :
              Abstract  Anderson    The principal investigator will continue to  develop a
              geometric spectral theory for n-tuples of self-adjoint operators in finite von
              Neumann algebras.  One goal is to use this new approach to try to develop a
              coherent theory of the joint spectrum of such operators.   Another aim is to
              use it to deepen our understanding of the structure of such operator algebras
              as irrational rotation algebras and von Neumann algebras determined by free
              groups.      This project is concerned with the study of certain aspects of
              operator algebras. These objects have proved fruitful in the study of a wide
              variety of questions, including  problems in such fields as mathematical
              physics, quantum mechanics and knot theory.  The principal investigator and his
              coworkers have discovered  a new way to view certain analytic data (eigenvalues
              of matrices and their infinite dimensional analogues - spectra of operators). 
              A major goal of the project is to solve a difficult problem (joint spectrum for
              non-commuting operators), which thus far has withstood repeated vigorous
              attacks. It is well known that eigenvalues and other spectral data are
              essential in understanding many real world problems in engineering and science.
               Thus, it is possible that this project could produce  methods for attacking
              questions in applied mathematics that have not been previously accessible.
