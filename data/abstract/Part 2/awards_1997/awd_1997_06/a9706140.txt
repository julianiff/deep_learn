Abstract    :
              9706140  Phillips     The proposed work will broaden our understanding of the
              relationship between the structure and dynamics of the continental lithosphere
              inferred from simple elastic plate flexure models by employing more realistic,
              inelastic, finite element representations.  Crust-mantle decoupling in
              convergent settings, which is inferred from anomalously low elastic plate
              thicknesses at some foreland basins, will be investigated.  Finite element
              models of the lithosphere incorporating elastic-plastic and
              elasto-visco-plastic rheologies will be applied to this problem to determine
              under what conditions flexure produces crust-mantle decoupling.  Finite element
              modeling will also be used to evaluate the importance of ostensibly
              second-order processes such as heat transfer within underthrust lithosphere,
              loading history, spatially variable strain rates, and a gravitational body
              force.  The ultimate test of these models will be compatibility with
              observations at foreland basins where low elastic thicknesses are found. 
              Crust-mantle decoupling in these environments may provide constraints on the
              strength and/or viscosity, and perhaps composition, of the lower crust.  The
              end-product of this study will be a comprehensive and physically robust model
              of lithospheric thermal-mechanical behavior at zones of continental
              underthrusting.  ***
