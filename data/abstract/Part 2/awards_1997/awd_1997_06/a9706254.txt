Abstract    :
              9706254  Stolper  The goals of this project are (1) to develop an experimental
              data base at 25 and 30 kbar characterizing the major element compositions of
              vapor-undersaturated liquids produced by near-solidus melting of subducted,
              hydrated mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) beneath island arcs; (2) to determine
              whether hydrous near-solidus in equilibrium with an eclogite residue are
              interconnected at low melt fractions, which is important for understanding
              whether these liquids can be extracted from the slab into the overlying mantle
              wedge; and (3) to determine the partitioning of high field strength (HFS) and
              rare earth elements (REE) between clinopyroxene, garnet, and near-solidus
              melts.  The experiments proposed here will expand the ability to model the
              geochemical signature of near-solidus slab melts and hoe this signature would
              alter the mantle and be expressed in erupted lavas from convergent margins.
