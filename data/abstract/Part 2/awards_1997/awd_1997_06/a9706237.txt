Abstract    :
              9706237  Frost  The purpose of the project is to determine the extent to which
              juvenile, mantle-derived magmas are added to the continental crust during
              production of  anorogenic granites. This study will focus on the reduced
              rapakivi-type granites. Two models for their origin will be tested: (1)
              Production by melting of evolved continental crust and (2) production by
              partial melting of differentiated tholeiitic magmas emplaced at or near the
              base of the crust. The field area is the Sherman batholith in the Mule Creek
              block of the Laramide Mountains, Wyoming. This research combines field work,
              petrography geochemistry, Nd, Sr and Pb isotopic analyses, and determination of
              intensive parameters.
