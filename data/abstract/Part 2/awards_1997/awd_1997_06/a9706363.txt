Abstract    :
              9706363  Johnson  Tens of millions of years ago western North American
              experienced volcanism like that of Mt. St. Helens, but of considerably greater
              magnitude. Virtually simultaneously, about 31-26 million years ago, an
              especially intense and voluminous series of violent eruptions broadcast
              blankets of hot, incandescent ash over large parts of the southwestern U.S. and
              western Mexico to depths of a thousand feet and more locally.  Eruption rates,
              on the order of 1000 cubic miles per million years, were unusually large for
              this type of volcanism. As these vast volumes of gas-charged magma were erupted
              in almost a geologic instant, the ground overlying the evacuating magma chamber
              collapsed to create a topographic depression--a caldera--tens of miles in
              diameter. Our research is a continuation of an NSF-funded study begun a decade
              ago on these colossal caldera-forming eruptions in Nevada and Utah. The
              research will complete the chronology of the eruptions using state-of-the-art
              argon isotopic clocks and will measure ratios of other isotopes of elements
              such as strontium (Sr), neodymium (Nd), and lead (Pb) that indicate relative
              contributions of crustal and mantle material to the erupted magmas. This
              information will help us constrain the geological processes responsible for the
              creation and eruption of how such enormous volumes of magma in the context of
              the plate tectonics of western North America.
