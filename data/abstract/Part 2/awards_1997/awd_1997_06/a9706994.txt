Abstract    :
              Abstract  Rychlik    Rychlik will investigate the following problems: The
              existence of special classes of solutions in non-linear difference equations
              and ordinary differential equations which correspond to homoclinic and
              heteroclinic connections.  The existence of algebraic integrals for a class of
              symplectic maps.  The measure of periodic trajectories in billiard systems. 
              The existence of traveling wave and breather solutions to PDEs.  Development
              and implementation of algorithms for dealing with systems of multi-variate
              polynomial equations with many parameters that often arise in applications.   
              The problems selected for this project generally invite the use of techniques
              from algebraic geometry and complex analysis.  The main objective of the
              current project is to show that advanced techniques from these fields are
              useful in solving problems of dynamics. A result of this research will be a
              suite of algebraic and complex-analytic methods general enough to be applied to
              other problems.
