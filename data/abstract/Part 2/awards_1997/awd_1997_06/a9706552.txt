Abstract    :
              9706552  Sussman  Plants contain an unknown compound that travels from the
              leaves to meristems and initiates flowering.  The chemical nature of this
              so-called florigen has not been found, although the topic is around for more
              than 50 years.  Indications are that it may be a peptide.  As outlined by Dr.
              Sussman, he has a population of Arabidopsis which contain a marker protein
              expressed under control of an "early-flowering" promoter and he seems to be
              able to look in a titerplate assay for peptides fro a combinatorial peptide
              library for the one that induces this promoter.  It is a dangerous experiment,
              but the rewards can be tremendous - both from a basic science viewpoint (there
              is only one other peptide "hormone" identified in plants), and from an
              application standpoint.  Spray a peptide and induce flowering in the field
              simultaneously and earlier than nature would do it.
