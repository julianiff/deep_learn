Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9706494  SHEEHAN  BARROW ARCTIC SCIENCE CONSORTIUM    This
              proposal is to establish a Cooperative Agreement between the Barrow Arctic
              Science Consortium (BASC) and the NSF Office of Polar Programs.  The
              Cooperative Agreement concentrates on maintenance and facilitation of research
              on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO).  BASC will be responsible for
              management of the 7,644 acre BEO, recapture of unpublished data associated with
              BEO and other North Slope and northern research, and facilitation of scientific
              research and access of Arctic scientists to BEO.
