Abstract    :
              9706887    Li    This research is on geometric problems  in  three related
              areas, all based on solving nonlinear second order partial   differential
              equations of various types. The first concerns an analogue  of the Yamabe
              problem on manifolds with boundaries: To study, for a given  compact Riemannian
              manifold with boundary (M,g), the existence  and compactness of metrics 
              conformal to g that have constant  scalar curvature and constant boundary mean
              curvature.  This is equivalent  to the study of the existence and compactness
              of positive solutions to a  certain semilinear elliptic equation with critical
              exponent satisfying  certain nonlinear Neuman boundary conditions.  The second
              concerns  the problem of   prescribing scalar curvature on the n-sphere.  The
              problem is better  understood in dimension n=2,3,4.  The goal here is to search
              for good  existence criterion in dimension n >= 5  that allow the prescribed 
              curvature functions K to be  Morse functions.    The third concerns the study
              of degenerate Monge-Ampere equations,  especially those arising from geometry. 
                 Partial differential equations arise naturally from physics, geometry,  and
              many other fields and form a basis for mathematical modeling  of the physical
              world.  The role of mathematical analysis is not so  much to create the
              equations as it is to create qualitative and quantitative  information about
              the solutions.   This may include answers to questions  about existence,
              uniqueness, smoothness, and growth. In addition, analysis  often develops
              methods for approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these
              approximations.
