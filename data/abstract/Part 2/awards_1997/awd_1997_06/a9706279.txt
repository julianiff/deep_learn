Abstract    :
              9706279  Ohmoto  The goal of this research is to develop a comprehensive model
              for the formation processes of gold-uranium deposits occurring in conglomerate 
              beds of ~2.8 Ga to ~2.0 Ga and their paleoenvironments.  The results of this
              study will lead to a better exploration model for this most important class of
              mineral deposits, and to a better understanding of the evolutionary history of
              the early EarthOs atmosphere and biosphere.  The research goal will be achieved
               by seeking solutions to three major problems: (1) what are the origins of
              gold, uraninite, and pyrite: detrital, diagenetic, or hydrothermal?; (2) what
              are the origins of the fluids involved in dissolution/precipitation of gold,
              uraninite, and pyrite: oxygen-bearing ground water or high  temperature
              hydrothermal fluid?; and (3) what are the origins of organic matter: indigenous
              microbial mats or extraneous petroleum?  Solutions to these three problems will
              be sought from detailed and systematic investigations of a variety of minerals
              and organic matter in ore and country rocks in the Witwatersrand district,
              South Africa, and the Elliot Lake district, Canada. The investigations will
              focus on micro-scale variations in mineralogical characteristics (morphology,
              texture, abundance, paragenesis), chemical characteristics (major, trace, and
              rare earth elements), and stable isotopic characteristics (H, O, C, and S).
