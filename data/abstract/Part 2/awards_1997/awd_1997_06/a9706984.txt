Abstract    :
              9706984  Nash  A cooperative, international investigation of the lichens (both
              micro-and macrolichens) of the  greater Sonoran Desert region (Arizona,
              southern California, Baja California, Sonora and  Northern Sinaloa) was funded
              by DEB 92-01111. The project has made progress toward writing a modern lichen
              flora for use by systematists and other professional botanists as well as
              decision-makers. Because the Sonoran Desert includes a significant number of
              Clean Air Act Class I areas, and because lichens are excellent indicators of
              air pollution, it is anticipated that  the flora will have considerable utility
              to land managers in both the U.S. Forest Service and  National Park Services
              (both U.S. and Mexican). Liason has been established with institutions  within
              Mexico and collaboration and with over 60 prominent lichen systematists
              worldwide. Publications from this project so far document the discovery of 50
              species new to science, and the first records of distribution in the Sonoran
              Desert for over 200 more.  By the completion of the project, the flora will
              treat over 1700 species in 328 genera.
