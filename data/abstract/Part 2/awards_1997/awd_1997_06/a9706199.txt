Abstract    :
              9706199  Schlische   Considerable interest exists in extrapolating fault
              behavior and attributes of small, easily studied faults to large, typically
              more difficult to study, major faults.  The scaling relations in fault
              populations of interest include the size distribution of faults, the
              relationship between displacement and length, the spatial distribution of
              faults, and the strain accommodated.  This study will utilize exposures of
              rocks where faults of various sizes have been identified.  The work will be
              directed towards testing several hypotheses concerning how faults are spatially
              distributed in relation to major faults and on how various fault parameters
              change as the faults become larger.  Result will be of use in fault modeling
              and in a variety of practical issues.
