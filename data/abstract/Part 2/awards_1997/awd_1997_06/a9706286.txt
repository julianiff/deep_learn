Abstract    :
              Early computers fetched data from memory only after it had been requested by the
               processor.  When memory latency is high, this demand fetch policy also has
              high  latency.  Many modern computers prefetch data from the memory before it
              is  requested, which can reduce the latency of memory as long as the
              prefetching is  accurate, and timely.    This project is a preliminary
              investigation of a Markov prefetcher, which uses  a Markov model to predict
              subsequent memory references from earlier references.   The prefetcher acts as
              an interface between on-chip and   off-chip caches that predicts multiple
              references to the memory system and  prioritizes their delivery to the
              processor.  Cycle-level simulations show that  use of a Markov prefetcher
              reduces the overall execution stalls due to memory  operations by about 54%
              while also reducing memory usage.    This project is extending the initial
              investigation to provide more realistic  analysis of the effectiveness of
              Markov prefetching, reduce implementation costs,  and apply the technique to
              multiprocessor systems. In addition, new aspects of  prefetching are being
              examined, including prediction of access methods (read or  write), prefetching
              between processors, and prefetching between different levels  of the memory
              hierarchy.  The primary research method is cycle-level simulation.
