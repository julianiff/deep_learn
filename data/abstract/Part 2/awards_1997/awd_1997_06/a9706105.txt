Abstract    :
              97-06105  Wanamaker    The significant hydrogen concentrations found in mantle
              minerals and the rapid  hydrogen diffusivities measured experimentally in
              olivine have led several researchers to argue that the relatively high
              electrical conductivities measured for Earth's upper mantle result from
              hydrogen defects in the olivine structure.  However, new  measurements by the
              PI of the electrical conductivity at one atmosphere show that "wet" olivine
              crystals are initially less conductive than "dry" crystals and that the
              conductivity of the "wet" crystals is observed  to increase with time,
              approaching that of the dry crystals after approximately 10 hours at 800=B0C. 
              This increase in conductivity is accompanied by a decrease in the hydrogen
              content of the crystals as determined using infra-red spectroscopy.  In this
              proposal the PI proposes experiments to establish the relative electrical
              conductivities of olivine with and without hydrogen at elevated pressure and
              hydrogen fugacity, and to determine quantitatively the effect of hydrogen on
              the concentrations and mobilities of defects in olivine and the transport  
              properties of the upper mantle. These experiments will establish the nature of
              the  hydrogen defects, their mobility in the olivine crystal structure, their
              effect on the concentrations and mobilities of other olivine defects, and how
              these parameters vary with temperature and pressure.  These data will allow
              predictions to be made about the effects of hydrogen on other transport and
              rheological properties of olivine and test existing theoretical models of the 
              sources of high electrical conductivity anomalies and low seismic velocity
              anomalies in Earth's mantle.  ***
