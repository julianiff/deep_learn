Abstract    :
              This research project investigates protocols to support group  communication
              services in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)  networks.  As ATM networks are
              increasingly used to provide  services in telecommunications networks and the
              Internet, there  is a pressing need for flexible and extensible group 
              communication protocols that exploit features of ATM in order to  offer high
              performance services to group-based applications.  Important issues that must
              be addressed in providing group  services include construction and maintenance
              of multipoint  connections, group membership management, and consensus on a 
              group leader.  This research explores novel solutions to all  three problems
              that take advantage of the underlying link-state  routing (LSR) algorithm used
              to support point-to-point  communication.  Specifically, by modeling various
              aspects of  group communication as consensus problems under LSR, robust and 
              efficient solutions are developed to support multiple types of  multipoint
              connections, fault-tolerant leader/membership  consensus, and even improvements
              to LSR itself.  The resulting  protocols are intended to provide new group
              services both within  individual ATM networks as well as across interconnected,
               hierarchical ATM networks.  Additional and updated information on  this
              project can be found at http://www.cps.msu.edu/~mckinley/atm.
