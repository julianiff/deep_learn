Abstract    :
              9706332  Stone     Stress-relaxation experiments have demonstrated that many
              crystalline mineral and metal systems exhibit a mechanical (rheological)
              equation of state, by which it is possible to completely and uniquely specify
              the dislocation creep kinetics in terms of a single state variable, which is
              termed the "hardness" parameter.  This state variable must be related to   one
              or more aspects of the deformation- induced microstructure.  The PIs propose in
              this research to determine a microstructural basis for the hardness parameter
              in terms of statistical distributions of large numbers of dislocations and of
              larger-scale structures, for example, low-angle (subgrain) boundaries generated
              during transient and steady state creep.  The work focuses on single-crystal
              Fe-Mg silicate olivine with the ultimate goal of enhancing our ability to
              accurately extrapolate laboratory creep data to geophysical problems.  ***
