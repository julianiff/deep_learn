Abstract    :
              9706798  Harper    The incorporation of ophiolotic rock assemblages  that are
              believed to have formed on the ocean floor is a tenacious problem that
              continues to defy solution.  However, some of them can be used to reconstruct
              the oceanic environment in which they formed. In such cases they can contribute
              greatly to understanding the tectonic processes that lead to their
              incorporation  into upper crustal sedimentary assemblages. Harper's study using
              geochemistry, geochronology, sedimentary provenance and field structure  is a
              well defined one that will address these questions  in the Coast Range
              ophiolites in southwestern Oregon. His analytical methods  are varied, and the
              results will bear on the origin of this ophiolite sequence and on its
              relationship to other ophiolites in several structural belts in California.
