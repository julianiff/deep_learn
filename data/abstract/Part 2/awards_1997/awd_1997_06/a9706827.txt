Abstract    :
              9706827  Stanley Osher    This research is concerned with the accurate and
              efficient computation of "irregular" solutions of partial differential
              equations (PDEs).  This includes solutions with discontinuities, singularities,
              fine scale structure, or persistent oscillations.  The main topics include (1)
              kinetic formulations of nonlinear PDE's and applications; (2) interface
              capturing through the level set method; (3) discontinuity capturing based on
              ideas developed for the numerical solution of conservation laws; and (4)
              numerical and analytical study of oscillations and critical threshold
              phenomena.    The proposed research will impact numerous areas of science and
              technology.  With the advent of modern computers, formerly intractable problems
              can be solved accurately.  This, of course, requires accurate and convergent
              algorithms for these difficult nonlinear and computationally intense problems. 
              The algorithms formerly developed by this group are already in wide use
              throughout the country in national laboratories and industry.  The proposed
              methods to be developed here will be useful in a host of applications including
              combustion, oil recovery, crystal growth, electromagnetic and acoustic
              scattering, thin film semiconductor growth, aircraft design, to name just a
              few.
