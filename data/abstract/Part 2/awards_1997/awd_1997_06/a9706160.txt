Abstract    :
              ***  This  award,  in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research  mode,  raises 
              the question whether it is feasible to develop  paradigms  for human-robot
              cooperation which take advantage of the differing  and  complementary
              capabilities of human and machine, to optimize  the  cooperative effort. Thus,
              for example, such a  scheme  would  combine autonomous low-level planning and
              control on the part  of  the  robot with higher level human reasoning and
              command, so that  the  pair  could  cooperate effectively in  accomplishing 
              tasks.  Methods will be explored for smothly coordinating those human and 
              machine functions.***
