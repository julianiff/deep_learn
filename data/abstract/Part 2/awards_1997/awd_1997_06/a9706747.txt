Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop and experimentally verify  the
              performance, usability and scalability of a modern  programming language
              approach to constructing complex vision-  based systems.  The research combines
              recent advances in the  theory and practice of imperative functional
              programming and  domain-specific languages with recent innovations in the 
              development of algorithms for performing visual tracking and  vision-based
              motion control.  Specific research objectives  include: advancing the state of
              the art in designing domain-  specific languages for rapid prototyping,
              developing and  empirical testing methodologies for combining high-level 
              languages with performance-critical components written in  standard
              (imperative, non-typesafe) languages, and the validation  of a high-level,
              high-performance programming framework for  vision and robotics through
              empirical demonstration. The impact  of this research will be the transfer of
              modern programming  language concepts (such as monadic programming,
              process-algebraic  approaches to concurrency, and time-varying behaviors) into
              a  novel, non-trivial application area, the identification of the  critical
              components of such systems with respect to both  functionality and performance,
              and the dissemination of a  flexible, portable, and freely available software
              environment for  visual tracking and vision-based motion control.
