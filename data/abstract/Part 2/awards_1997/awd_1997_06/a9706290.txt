Abstract    :
              9706290  Ballentine  This study involves a detailed characterization of both the
              noble gas and radiogenic isotopic composition of basalts from the classic HIMU
              Cameroon volcanic chain. The radiogenic isotopic compositions (Pb, Sr, Nd, Hf)
              in mantle-derived materials are encompassed by four end member compositions.
              One of these, HIMU, is characterized by Pb isotopic values which are much more
              radiogenic (higher time integrated U/Pb ratio) than any other mantle end
              member. Models of terrestrial mantle evolution proposed to account for the
              origin of HIMU include recycling of oceanic lithosphere, intramantle
              metasomatism and delamination of lithospheric mantle. Resolving which of these
              models is correct will profoundly affect our understanding of the evolution of
              the terrestrial mantle. A key component in this resolution is the noble gas
              isotopic composition of the HIMU source. In the simplest case the 3He/4He ratio
              of a degassed and U enriched (relative to upper mantle) recycled portion of
              oceanic crust will rapidly become very much lower than portions of the mantle
              enriched in U by metasomatism. The distinction between subducted oceanic crust
              and intramantle sources however, may become blurred by either mixing of ambient
              upper mantle with HIMU basalts, or diffusive equilibration of He within the
              protolith. By relating the 3He/4He composition with the radiogenic isotopes we
              hope to constrain these processes. The Cameroon line samples will therefore
              enable us to characterize the noble gas composition and hence the origin of
              this HIMU source.
