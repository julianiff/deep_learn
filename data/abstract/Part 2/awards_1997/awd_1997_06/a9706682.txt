Abstract    :
              9706682  Hausback  This project aims at studying the poorly known Sutter Buttes,
              an isolated volcano that contain the only indigenous mag matic rock exposures
              in the entire Central Valley of California. The volcano is composed of a
              central core of volcanic domes surrounded by a large fragmental apron that
              record  a lengthy evolution of explosive volcanism in this area. The volcanic
              rocks of Sutter Buttes represent a diverse sub-alkalic suite ranging from
              rhyolite to mafic andesite that erupted in early Pleistocene time, during the
              profound tectonic transition from subduction to transform faulting, of the
              western North America plate boundary. This unique tectonic setting of the
              Sutter Buttes provides an unprecedent opportunity to understand magma
              production during this type of transition. It is proposed to establish a
              framework of integrated geological mapping, petrographic documentation,
              microprobe mineral analyses, and 40Ar/39Ar geochronologic studies of the
              volcanic rocks and their basement. At this stage, it is unclear if the Sutter
              Buttes are related to any other magmatic feature, such as the Cascades or to
              the young volcanic activity in the Sonoma and Clear Lakes areas.  The results
              of this work should constrain some of the genetic features of this unique
              volcano and help put its magmatism into the regional tectonic framework.
