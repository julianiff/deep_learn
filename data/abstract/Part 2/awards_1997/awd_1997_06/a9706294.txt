Abstract    :
              9706294  Burbank    As important as folding is to mountain belts, an
              understanding of the rates and styles of evolution of folds is very poorly
              known.  This proposal will use the distribution of fluvial terraces in time and
              space to address this problem of identifying the rates of fold development in a
              the transpressional region of the northern island of New Zealand. Because
              fluvial terraces can be dated, and their elevations while active can be
              calculated, any deformation of the landscape will lead to permanent abandonment
               and preservation of these unused terraces. By identifying a series of such
              terraces, the evolution of elevations in time and space  can be calculated,
              thus revealing the effect of active folding on the landscape.
