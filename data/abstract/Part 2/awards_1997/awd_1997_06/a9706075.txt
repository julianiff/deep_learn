Abstract    :
              9706075  Lange  This project involves experiments to measure the density,
              thermal expansivity and compressibility of H2O-bearing magmatic liquids between
              400 and 1300oC and from 1 bar to 2000 MPa.  Two approaches will be taken:  (1)
              low temperature density measurements of hydrous liquids at their glass
              transition temperatures, and (2) the sinking and floating of ultra-pure
              crystalline graphite and commercially carbon-coated quartz, albite, and
              anorthite buoyancy markers in a rapid-quench cold-seal pressure apparatus
              between 50-200 MPa and a piston cylinder apparatus between 600-2000 MPa.  The
              results will have application to problems of melt segregation and migration
              from source regions and the dynamics of melt degassing and fragmentation during
              explosive magmatic eruptions.
