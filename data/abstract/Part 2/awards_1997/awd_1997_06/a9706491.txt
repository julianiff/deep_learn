Abstract    :
              Recent empirical studies have shown that self-similar traffic models, which are
              rooted in chaos theory, may be more appropriate than the models typically in
              use for network traffic.  Without an understanding of the causes of this
              self-similar behavior, it is difficult to say how widely applicable these
              models are, or what if anything should be done to mitigate the will explore
              whether network protocols themselves can make traffic appear chaotic over time
              scales of engineering interest, and if so, whether protocol modifications might
              help.  This will be achieved by simulating realistic models of a variety of
              networks, present and future.  In each simulation, a well-behaved (non-chaotic)
              model for input traffic will be employed, and it will be determined whether the
              network protocols can turn this well-behaved input into chaotic or self-similar
              traffic flows.
