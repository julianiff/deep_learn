Abstract    :
              9706475   Schloz  One of the more critical gaps in our understanding of faults
              and fault evolution is that of how the stresses around active faults interact.
              The interaction can govern fault spacing, and can cause linkage and coalescence
              of small faults that leads to the development of larger faults. The project is
              a field based study of cm, m, and km scale faulting the Appalachians and in the
              northern east African rift zone, where the geometry  of faults will be measured
              and plotted.  The final analysis will be aided by discrete element elastic
              modeling, which should lead to general conclusions about any active faulting
              everywhere.
