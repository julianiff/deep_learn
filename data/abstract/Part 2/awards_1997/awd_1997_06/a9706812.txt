Abstract    :
              9706812  Galletti  Partial support is requested for the International Society 
              for Artificial Organs conference to be held June 29-July 1,  1997 in
              Providence, RI.  Funding from the Foundation would  be used for travel and
              conference fee support for up to ten  graduate students.    The meeting is
              expected to  help the U.S. meet new  challenges in the development of
              artificial internal organs,  viz.         The need to establish a strong
              engineering design basis       for devices expected to perform for increasingly
              longer       periods of time.         The  need to sustain bioengineering
              innovation  in  the       U.S.  academic community and to transfer that
              knowledge       to  American  industry  for R & D  related  to  medical      
              devices.              The  need  to  consider  simultaneously  technological,  
                  economic  and  ethical issues in  the  distribution  of       health care
              resources.              The   need   to  attract  women  and  under-represented
                    minorities  to  a field which already employs  a  large       number of
              bioengineering graduates.    It is expected that new innovative and proactive 
              interactions will develop among the groups participating in  the meeting.  The
              young scientists to be supported by NSF  funds will have an excellent
              opportunity themselves to  engage in such interactions; a special session is
              planned  wherein the students can meet with their peers.    Abstracts of
              presentations at the meeting are to published  in an Abstract Volume that will
              constitute a regular issue  of  Artificial Organs, the official journal of the 
              International Society for Artificial Organs.
