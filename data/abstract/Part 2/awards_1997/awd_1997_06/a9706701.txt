Abstract    :
                      ABSTRACT      Proposal Number:  CTS-9706701  Principal Investigator: 
              Katz      The present study is an integrated experimental and numerical effort
              to determine and explain the conditions for the onset of cavitation in
              high-Reynolds-number jets. Experimentally, high resolution PIV will be used to
              measure the unsteady velocity distribution within primary vortices, from which
              one can extract the vorticity and strain.  Holography and video photography
              will be used to determine the motion of artificially-introduced microscopic
              seed bubbles.  The pressure field within the primary eddies will be determined
              using microscopic bubbles as pressure sensors.  The conditions for cavitation
              inception within observed secondary vortices (ribs) will be used to estimate
              the corresponding pressure minima. Computationally, Lagrangian simulations of
              primary structures will be conducted, with initial and boundary conditions
              provided by the experiments.  The simulations will be first validated by
              comparison with the experimental results, and then used to analyze the impact
              of slenderness ratio on the pressure field within primary vortices and the
              strain field that they induce.  The measured strain field will be used in
              direct numerical simulation of the rollup of streamwise vorticity perturbations
              in the braids.  The experimentally-determined pressure minima within the ribs
              can then be used to select the appropriate streamwise vorticity perturbation
              levels. This combined approach will enable a mapping the pressure distribution
              within the near field of the jet.
