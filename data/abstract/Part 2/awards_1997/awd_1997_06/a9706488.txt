Abstract    :
              9706488  Sornette    This research involves the application of the fundamentals
              of complexity to the nature and organization in space and time of large
              earthquakes, and their relation with precursory phenomena.  The work will
              proceed in three steps: 1) the study of the rupture process in the
              heterogeneous crust and the classification of the different regimes as a
              function of the degree of disorder; 2) the repetition of large earthquakes and
              their statistical organization; and 3) the possibility for large earthquakes to
              exhibit seismic (and other) precursors possibly associated to collective
              phenomena.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program.  ***
