Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT DMS-9706875    Smirnov      Smirnov will work on harmonic measure and
              distortion properties of   conformal mappings. Harmonic measure is a 
              fundamental object in   complex analysis, providing a good description  of the
              geometry of   sets in the complex plane.  This project will focus on the  
              investigations into the fine (local)  structure of   harmonic measure, related
              properties of Green's functions, and   possible applications to holomorphic
              dynamical systems. It seems   that extremal behavior of harmonic measure occurs
              for   fractal examples arising from complex dynamics and self-similar  
              constructions. Therefore, powerful machinery, developed for   investigations of
              dynamical systems (ergodic theory, thermodynamical  formalism, holomorphic
              motions) might be useful (and perhaps necessary)   for solving some problems in
              classical complex analysis.     This project emphasizes research in, and
              interaction between two   important areas of mathematics: classical complex
              analysis and   dynamical systems. Dynamical systems is one of the more active
              areas  of modern mathematics with applications to biology, engineering  and
              physics. Classically,  the analytical approach helped to   solve many hard
              problems in dynamical systems. Recently it has  become apparent, that answers
              to many classical analytical   problems have a deep,  dynamical origin.
