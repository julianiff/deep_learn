Abstract    :
              9706046  Prothero    The Eocene-Oligocene transition was critical period in
              Earth history, when the "greenhouse" conditions of the early Eocene were
              replaced by the "icehouse" conditions of the Oligocene.  The mass extinctions
              and other biotic responses caused by this climatic change have been studied in
              many places, but the excellent fossil record of molluscs and foraminifera found
              in California marine strata has been relatively little studied because the
              chronostratigraphy has been so poorly resolved and calibrated.  The middle
              Eocene to Oligocene marine strata of the Santa Cruz Mountains provide the best
              superposed record in California of the Narizian, Refugian, and Zemorrian
              benthic foraminiferal stages that are also calibrated by planktonic
              microfossils.  Preliminary magnetic analysis of the late
              Narizian-Refugian-early Zemorrian interval in San Lorenzo River yielded results
              which pass both a fold test and reversal test, and show that the latest
              Narizian-Refugian correlate with Chrons C13r-C13n (34.5-33.0 Ma), and the early
              Zemorrian with late Cron C12r (31.5-31.0Ma).  Three additional sections in the
              area will be sampled:  one spans the early and late Narizian, the second the
              early and late Zemorrian, and the third is the type section of the Twobar Shale
              and Rices Mudstone members of the San Lorenzo Formation.  Magnetostratigraphy
              of the entire Narizian through Zemorrian interval in the Santa Cruz Mountains
              will greatly help in the correlation and calibration of these
              long-controversial benthic foraminiferal stages.  Such high-resolution
              chronostratigraphy, in turn, will allow us to correlate events during the
              Eocene-Oligocene transition in the Pacific Coast with the excellent records in
              the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts, with faunal and floral changes recorded in
              terrestrial sections, and with the global record/
