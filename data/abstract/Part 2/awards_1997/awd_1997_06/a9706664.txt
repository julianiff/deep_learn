Abstract    :
              9706664  Pena de Ortiz    The formation of long term memory is though to involve
              the  modification of cells within the brain. Such modification is  believed to
              depend on changes in the regulation of gene  function in those cells. This
              project uses the techniques of  molecular biology to investigate changes in
              gene expression  during the acquisition of memory in one important part of  the
              brain termed the hippocampus. The project documents the  time course of 
              changes in gene expression that occur as  memories are acquired. Experiments
              then proceed to identify  the DNA sequences of genes linked to learning-induced
               changes, and thereafter the functions of the products of  those genes. The
              results of this project will add  significantly to the understanding of how the
              brain stores  information
