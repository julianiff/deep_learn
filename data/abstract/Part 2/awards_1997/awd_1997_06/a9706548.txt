Abstract    :
              9706548  Cooke   Flexural slip along bedding is a common occurrence in folding,
              and have a variety of consequences to the development of folds.  This study
              will investigate mechanical stratigraphy, lateral variations in apparent
              friction along bedding and deformation within individual layers of rocks
              involved in the East Kaibab Monocline.   These field observations will be
              compared to numerically predicted results, and the role of flexural slip in
              fold development assessed.  Also included is consideration of the possible
              influence of exhumation on flexure.  Results are intended to provide criteria
              for determining the relative contributions of tectonic loading and exhumation
              to observed brittle structures and fold form.
