Abstract    :
                CTS-9706942  Duke University  Adrian Bejan              ABSTRACT       The
              proposed work is a fundamental study of the architecture of flow paths between
              a finite-size space and one or more discrete points.  Thermodynamic principles
              will be used to deterministically optimize networks for systems with volumetric
              heat and fluid flow.  The optimization is based on geometrically minimizing the
              resistance to flow.  The work is relevant to many engineering applications such
              as the design of heat exchangers, thermal storage systems, etc.  It is also
              relevant to the understanding of the architecture of the natural environment
              such as biological and geological systems.
