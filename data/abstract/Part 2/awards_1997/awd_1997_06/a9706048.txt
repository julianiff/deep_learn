Abstract    :
              9706048  Molz    From a contaminant transport viewpoint, hydraulic conductivity
              (K) is the single most important property function.  K is highly heterogeneous,
              and quantifying the K distribution is a prerequisite to understanding
              contaminant migration.  Over the past decade an increasing number of studies
              have documented the existence of fractal scaling in K distributions.  However,
              the scaling appears to be of a variable nature that is characterized by a
              special family of PDF's known as Levy-stable processes.  Different sets of
              increments display properties of different members of the Levy-stable class,
              which suggests a type of fractal known as a universal multi-fractal.  It has
              been shown recently that the universal multi-fractal paradigm, which includes
              monofractals as a special case, is successful in modeling the fractal scaling
              in most K data sets, and the desire to exploit this observation fully is the
              motivation of the present proposal.  The 3 objectives are: I) Develop
              procedures for the generation and data conditioning of 3-D multi-fractal
              structures;  II) Evaluate multi-fractal effects on solute transport by
              simulating tracer tests conducted at the highly heterogeneous MADE site; and
              III) Determine the behavior of plume-scale apparent dispersivity involving
              multi-fractal scaling and compare the results to that derived from conventional
              statistical theories.  Meeting these 3 objectives will increase understanding
              significantly of fractal scaling in porous media and the effect on contaminant
              transport.
