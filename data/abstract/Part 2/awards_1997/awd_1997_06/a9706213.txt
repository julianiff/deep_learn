Abstract    :
              9706213  Cooper    The dynamic and quasistatic mechanical responses of carefully
              engineered aggregates of ferromagnesian olivine and of microstructurally
              equilibrated olivine + synthetic basalt partial melts will be evaluated as
              functions of temperature, frequency, grain size  and loading morphology
              (Young's-modulus mode in compression and flexure, shear-modulus mode in
              torsion).  The experiments emphasize (i) the use of drained conditions for the
              partial   melts, (ii) the use of specific differential-stress and temperature
              potentials combined with a fine grain size such that a Newtonian rheology
              describes the crystalline phase in both partial melt and melt-free states, and
              (iii) a low-viscosity liquid phase in the partial melt experiments such that
              the compaction length exceeds the specimen size.  The immediate goal of the
              research is to discriminate the effect(s) of partial melting on the dynamic
              signature of the aggregate from the intrinsic behavior associated with the
              dissipation of energy by solid-state grain-boundary processes.  Given the
              experimental parameters to be explored, extrapolation   of the results to
              upper-mantle conditions is possible.  The longer-range goal of the research is
              to initiate evaluation of melt-segregation microstructures ("mesostructures")
              on the dynamic  response.  ***
