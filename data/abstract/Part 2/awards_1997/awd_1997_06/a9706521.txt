Abstract    :
              9706521  Sisson   The uplift and exhumation of high-pressure metamorphic rocks
              related to subduction is a classic, unsolved geologic problem.  High P/low T
              assemblages are generally thought to have formed a t great depth in subduction
              zones, but brought to the surface by a variety of possible mechanisms,
              resulting in two "types"- one characterized by retrograde, approximately
              isothermal decompression, and the other by a decompression path parallel to
              their prograde P/T path.  In northern Venezuela there are two occurrences of
              High P/low T metamorphic belts of the same age and thought to be associated
              with the same subduction zone.  However one is of the "Franciscan-type" and the
              other of the "Alpine-Type".  This project will attempt to exploit this
              circumstance and isolate the mechanisms of uplift and ascent leading to the
              different types, and will involve extensive structural and petrologic study of
              each occurrence.  Results have the potential for shedding considerable light on
              the uplift and exposure of rocks metamorphosed deep in subduction zones.
