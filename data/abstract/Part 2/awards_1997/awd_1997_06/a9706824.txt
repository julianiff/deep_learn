Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9706824  Vijay Modi/Columbia U.    Accurate estimation of mass
              flux in impinging flow systems is important to wet chemical processes such as
              water rinsing, photoresist development, electrodeposition and electrochemical
              machining.  The physical system of interest is a confined submerged slot jet
              impinging normally on a mass transfer surface under turbulent flow conditions. 
              The effect on hydrodynamics and mass transfer of small scale structures on the
              impingement surface, typical in MEMS device fabrication is not understood.
              Experimental measurements of mass transfer will be carried out for both flush
              surfaces as well as surfaces with structures ranging from 5 to 500 microns in
              size.  The location and aspect ratios of the structure will be varied as well. 
              Flush surface a single sensor will provide local mass transfer rates on the
              impinging surface.  For the smallest structure size, i.e. 5 microns, both
              single and multiple patterned structures will be considered.  Mass transfer
              measurements will be made by the electrochemical method, where ferricyanide
              ions are reduced on one or more closely-spaced platinum electrodes at a rate
              controlled by mass transfer to the surface.    An existing finite volume code
              will be utilized for modeling the incompressible turbulent fluid flow and mass
              transfer.  A major question that needs to be addressed is:  what is the
              appropriate model for the turbulent eddy diffusivity near the wall at the high
              Sc applications common to wet processing?  Since one single model that is valid
              for all turbulent flows are unlikely to emerge, the present effort will develop
              a model for the particular flow system of interest here.  The flush surface
              experimental data will aid in developing such a model.  This model will be
              implemented in the numerical solvers.  Once validated the ability of such a
              model to aid predicting the mass transfer to a surface with microstructures
              will be established.
