Abstract    :
              9706398  Ghebremichael  The effects of implantation of light ions in nonlinear
              optical polvmers will be studied.  The optical nonlinearity in the polymers is
              achieved by doping the optically inactive polymers with nonlinear optical
              chromophores.  Nonlinear optical polymers, when first processed, usually have
              an isotropic bulk svmmetry.  For such polymers to be used in second order
              nonlinear optical applications, where bulk asymmetry is required, the
              configuration of the chromophores has to be altered.    The orientational
              orders of the ion irradiation-induced orientational order is expected to be
              large because the ion deposition depth, thus any chemical or physical reaction,
              is highly localized and determined by the ion beam energy.  The relaxation time
              after ion implantation induced order is also expected to significantly
              increase, compared with the techniques currently employed, because this method
              is virtually temperature independent.    Nonlinear optical studies, such as
              second harmonic generation, electrooptic effect, and z-scan techniques will be
              used to estimate the degree of ion irradiation induced asymmetry in bulk
              samples and waveguide devices.  Furthermore, standard studies of linear optical
              and mechanical properties should reveal the effects of the irradiation on the
              integrity of the poled systems.  ***
