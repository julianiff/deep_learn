Abstract    :
              9706786  Kress  The proposed project is designed to explore and calibrate the
              thermochemistry of sulfide liquids in the system O-S-Fe-Ni-Cu.  Equilibrium
              experiments will be performed at one atmosphere pressure to calibrate a
              thermodynamic mixing model for liquids in the system.  The investigators then
              propose to explore the compositional and thermal dependence of molar volume
              using the double-bob Archimedean  method.  Liquid compressibilities will be
              determined in a variety of sulfide liquids using the technique of ultrasonic
              interferometry.  The resultant model for the sulfide liquid phase will be
              combined with data from the literature to calibrate a self-consistent model,
              which will then be incorporated into the melts crystallization code.  The
              ultimate goal is to derive a model which describes the major element chemistry
              and saturation conditions for sulfide liquids in the full diversity of igneous
              environments.
