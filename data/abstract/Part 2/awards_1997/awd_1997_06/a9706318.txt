Abstract    :
              9706318  Freymueller     This research will address two important problems in
              the active tectonics of Alaska, the slip rate on the Denali fault, and the
              relationship between the Denali fault and zones of active seismicity to the
              north. Past measurements of the slip rate on the Denali fault are in conflict.
              Line length measurements from 1975-1988 showed barely significant right lateral
              shear strain in two networks crossing the Denali fault, yet geologic estimates
              of the Holocene slip rate on the Denali fault are 8-12 mm/yr. Seismicity North
              of the Denali fault is concentrated in NE trending zones, with left-lateral
              slip on steeply dipping NE to NNE striking planes. These left-lateral,
              strike-slip faults have been interpreted as secondary faults bounding elongated
              crustal blocks in a broad shear zone between the Denali and Tintina
              (right-lateral) strike-slip faults. The PIs will measure the slip rate on the
              Denali fault and place some initial constraints on the strain rate across the
              active seismic zones to the north of it, using data from GPS (Global
              Positioning System) surveys and permanent GPS sites. They will also survey an
              extensive network across the active seismic zones that can be re-occupied in
              the future to more fully characterize the active deformation.  ***
