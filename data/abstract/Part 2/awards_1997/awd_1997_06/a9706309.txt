Abstract    :
                  The goal of this research is to study complexity issues, develop algorithms,
              and perform experiments with adaptive data compression algorithms, both
              lossless and lossy.  The work proposed will build on our previous and current
              research and will have a continued "theme" of a blend of theoretical and
              experimental work.  The term "high performance" has been used in the proposal
              title to indicate we are interested in algorithms that both compress well and
              can be implemented to run in real time in high bandwidth applications.  The
              areas of research proposed are:  * Error resilience;  * Optimizations for
              one-dimensional lossless compression;  * 2-D lossless compression;  * Adaptive
              VQ;  * Real-time video compression employing off-line learning;  * Parallel
              algorithms for adaptive compression;  * Automated browsing.
