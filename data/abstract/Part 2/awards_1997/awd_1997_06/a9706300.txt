Abstract    :
              9706300  Geissman  The Indian-Asian collision zone is the type locality of a
              continent-continent collision, and studies of this zone  reveal the tectonic
              processes of such collisions that are not obtainable in more ancient collision
              systems. Of particular concern is the controversy between the hypotheses of
              extrusion and rotation, in this case of blocks of Asian crust . Is the
              shortening of the Asian crust accomplished by extrusion of wedge-shaped blocks
              of crust, or by rotation-aided movement of these blocks. This study will
              address this issue by both structural and paleomagnetic  approaches.  The field
              structural and associated kinematic studies will  allow testing of the
              extrusion models, and the paleomagnetic studies will allow testing of the
              rotational studies.  Together both hypotheses can be tested for this critical
              region of southwest China, and will provide a strong context for the
              interpretation of more ancient mountain belts where structural overprinting
              have made these questions much more difficult to address.
