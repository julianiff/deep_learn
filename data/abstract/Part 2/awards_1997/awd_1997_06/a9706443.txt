Abstract    :
              Proposal: DMS-9706443    PI: Svetlana Jitomirskaya    This research involves
              localization type effects for Schrodinger  operators and for quantum spin
              systems, percolation, and contact processes in disordered environments, and the
              general study of spectra and wave functions of Schrodinger operators. The main
              objective is to develop methods of proving localization type effects for
              Schrodinger operators with deterministic potentials.  The other goal is to
              study the relation between spectral and quantum-dynamical properties and long
              time behavior as they relate to generalized eigenfunctions, particularly in the
              multidimensional case.  Another goal of the proposed research is to study
              singular continuous spectrum that exhibits critical behavior, particularly for
              models where it appears for critical values (or intervals) of the parameters.  
                The proposed research is centered around the fundamental properties of 
              disordered systems that serve as models of systems with impurities.  Impurities
              can substantially change various properties of the media and  can thus be used
              to create materials with desired properties.  In just this way transistors are
              made of materials with impurities. Disordered systems are also used in modeling
              many micro and macro effects: from quantum localization to earthquakes. The
              proposed topics include studying properties of highly disordered systems of
              Quantum Mechanics and of systems at critical levels of disorder that
              demonstrate highly unstable behavior.
