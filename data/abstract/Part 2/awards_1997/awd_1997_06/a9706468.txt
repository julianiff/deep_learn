Abstract    :
              9706468  Deino  Tens of millions of years ago western North American experienced
              volcanism like that of Mt. St. Helens, but of considerably greater magnitude.
              Virtually simultaneously, about 31-26 million years ago, an especially intense
              and voluminous series of violent eruptions broadcast blankets of hot,
              incandescent ash over large parts of the southwestern U.S. and western Mexico
              to depths of a thousand feet and more locally.  Eruption rates, on the order of
              1000 cubic miles per million years, were unusually large for this type of
              volcanism. As these vast volumes of gas-charged magma were erupted in almost a
              geologic instant, the ground overlying the evacuating magma chamber collapsed
              to create a topographic depression--a caldera--tens of miles in diameter. Our
              research is a continuation of an NSF-funded study begun a decade ago on these
              colossal caldera-forming eruptions in Nevada and Utah. The research will
              complete the chronology of the eruptions using state-of-the-art argon isotopic
              clocks and will measure ratios of other isotopes of elements such as strontium
              (Sr), neodymium (Nd), and lead (Pb) that indicate relative contributions of
              crustal and mantle material to the erupted magmas. This information will help
              us constrain the geological processes responsible for the creation and eruption
              of how such enormous volumes of magma in the context of the plate tectonics of
              western North America.
