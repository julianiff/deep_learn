Abstract    :
              9706439  Zhao     Measurements of the intensity of the Earth's magnetic field in
              the past are critical for understanding the processes in the core that give
              rise to the Earth's magnetic field, and how and why the Earth's magnetic field
              reverses polarity. In addition, variation of the intensity of the Earth's
              magnetic field over geologic time may signal modulation of dynamo action in the
              core by the convective state of the lower mantle, and thus could also carry
              information about the rates of sea-floor spreading, hot-spot volcanism and
              Earth's tectonic cycle. The PIs propose studies of two important geophysical
              problems which are currently debated: (1) to obtain mid-Cretaceous
              paleointensities (91 Ma) to examine the question of intensity of the  
              geomagnetic field during the Cretaceous Superchron, in particular whether the
              field was persistently low or unusually high during times of low reversal rate;
              (2) to determine the paleointensity from 7 Ma and 32 Ma old basalts to test
              whether the field strength is responsible for the relatively higher amplitude
              of marine magnetic anomalies that is observed in most of the world's oceans
              between 30 and 80 Ma.  ***
