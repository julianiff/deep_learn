Abstract    :
              9706188  Ritzwoller    This research is to implement developments done under
              previous  work on earth normal modes including improved measurement  techniques
              and expanded catalogues of more than 3,000 even and  odd degree structure
              coefficient estimates of 90 observable  multiplets below 3 mHz.  This work will
              extend this catalogue of  normal mode (generalized) structure coefficient
              estimates from 3  to 5 mHz focusing on data analysis of mantle-sensitive modes,
               rather than analysis of core-sensitive modes.  The goal is to  generate
              coefficient estimates, estimated errors, and misfit  statistics for at east 100
              new multiplets.  This expanded  catalogue will be used to assess existing
              mantle models.  ***
