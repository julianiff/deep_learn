Abstract    :
              9706326  Evans  This project will extend the PIs work on the crystallographic
              and thermodynamic properties of the aluminum-free "quadrilateral" amphiboles
              into the Al-bearing orthorhombic gedrite series and the monoclinic hornblende
              series, both of which occur widely in crystalline rocks.  X-ray single crystal
              structure refinements will be done on suites of natural samples encompassing a
              range of Mg/Fe ratios and Al-contents, prior to and after equilibration at
              700o-1000oC and high pressure.  Site scattering and bond length data will be
              incorporated with compositional data to provide a description of octahedral and
              tetrahedral site order-disorder as a function of temperature.  The Gibbs energy
              of these complex amphiboles is written to explicitly include the measured
              configurational entropy, as well as end-member, reciprocal and
              reciprocal-ordering terms.  Experimental, thermochemical and natural phase
              equilibrium data provide additional constraints.  These data allow calculation
              of phase diagrams for magmatic and subsolidus systems involving amphiboles and
              other minerals for which there are previously developed consistent
              thermodynamic models.
