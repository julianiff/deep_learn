Abstract    :
              9706469  Walker  Natural isotopic variations in Li are known to be large.
              However, the reasons for these variations and the extent of variations in
              particular natural systems have not been well established. In particular, the
              isotopic variations for the two isotopes of Li are quite large during magmatic
              processes. Consequently, Li isotopes could prove useful as a tracer of magmatic
              evolution and also as a geothermometer. Improved mass spectrometric and
              chemical separation techniques now permit Li isotope measurements at the (0.1%
              level. The PIs explore the behavior of Li isotopes in experimental and natural
              magmatic/aqueous systems. They will explore: (1) experimental partitioning of
              Li and Li-isotopes in melt-volatile phase-mineral systems; (2) variations in Li
              isotopes in granite-related mineral deposits; and (3) the variation of Li
              isotope compositions in a suite of related granites from the Black Hills of 
              South Dakota.
