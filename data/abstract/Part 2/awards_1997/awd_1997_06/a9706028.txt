Abstract    :
              9706028  Davis  A critical unresolved problem in tectonics is in understanding
              how intraplate regions deform. The origin of Colorado Plateau structures,
              especially  folds over reactivated  faults, is a primary avenue of approach to
              this problem in this type area of intraplate deformation. This study of Davis
              is aimed at identifying the role of the newly discovered strike-slip faulting
              as well as normal faulting in the evolution of the East Kaibab fault-fold
              system. In this study, Davis will map in detail  and make detailed structural
              analysis of selected portions of the system such that issues of structural and
              strain compatibility within an oblique-slip system to be evaluated along strike
              and down dip. The results of this study will bear on the relationships of
              basement faulting to folding, and of the kinematics and mechanics of the
              propagation of a fault zone through a mechanically inhomogeneous stratigraphic
              sequence.
