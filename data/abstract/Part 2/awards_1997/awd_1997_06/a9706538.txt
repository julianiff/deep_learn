Abstract    :
              9706538  Peppas  The goal of this research is the development of improved 
              bioadhesiare and mucoadhesive polymers that can be used for  wound healing or
              as carriers for drug targeting to specific  sites of the body.  The effect of
              crosslinking, polymer  hydrophilicity, and interdiffusion on the adhesion and 
              cohesion of hydrogels with adhesive functional groups in  contact with mucin
              will be investigated.  Hydrogels will be  prepared by free radical
              polymerization of acrylic acid, 2-  hydroxy ethyl methacrylate and ethylene
              glycol  dimethacrylate.  The surface chemistry of selected polymers  will be
              modified by grafting poly (ethylene glycol) of  varying molecular weights.  The
              surface and bulk properties  will be characterized by contact angle
              measurements, gas  chromatography, gel permeation chromatography, differential 
              scanning calorimetry and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)  spectroscopy. 
              Near-field FTIR will be used to study the  interdiffusion and adhesion process
              in contact with mucin  and identify the molecular characteristics that will
              provide  maximum mucoadhesion.  ***
