Abstract    :
              9706214  Grove  This project will carry out a series of coordinated
              experimental, field and theoretical studies aimed at understanding the
              processes, conditions of formation and chemical evolution of subduction zone
              magmas.  Experimental melting studies of peridotite and peridotite-analog bulk
              compositions at 1 to 3 GPa will investigate the effects of variable amounts of
              H2O (up to 8 wt. %) on the melting of the mantle wedge above the subduction
              zones.  Experiments performed under crustal pressure (100 to 800 MPa) and
              H2O-saturated conditions on basaltic andesites, andesites and andesite-analog
              compositions will provide information on model fractional crystallization of
              subduction zone magams.  Field studies in the Southern Cascade Range, U.S.A. to
              investigate spatially and temporally related lava flows will provide input fo
              rthe mantle melting and fractional crystallization studies.  Modeling studies
              will reproduce the physical conditions of melt generation in the mantle wedge. 
              The primary objective of this work is to understand factors that control the
              development of subduction-related magmatism globally.
