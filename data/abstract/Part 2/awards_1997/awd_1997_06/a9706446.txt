Abstract    :
              9706446  Harbert   Paleomagnetic data has proven key to the interpretation of
              terrane migration and accretion along several convergent continental margins,
              with Alaska being as notable example.  Existing data suggests that the
              Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia may also be a college of accreted allochthonous
              terranes, but the geologic and paleomagnetic data base is not extensive, and
              the area is difficult logistically.  This project will attempt to place the
              paleomagnetic and geologic data on a firmer base so that plate kinematic models
              related to terrane emplacement can be formulated and tested.  Results will
              increase knowledge about terranes in Kamchatka and provide the basis for
              understanding displacement histories of northern Pacific terranes.
