Abstract    :
              9706189  Green     The investigators will continue their experimental study of
              the rheology of partially molten crustal rocks and of mechanisms of melt
              segregation and extraction.  Over the next year they will conduct deformation
              experiments on partially molten, quartzo-feldspathic aggregates of various
              grain sizes to determine the grain-size sensitivity of creep, and thus the
              rate-controlling process under these conditions.  They will also investigate
              mechanisms of melt segregation by deforming partially molten samples with
              juxtaposed porous material to act as a melt sink.  By deforming rocks with
              different melt fractions, they hope to determine the amount of melt that the
              rock can hold and still deform by ductile mechanisms.  These deformation
              experiments will be conducted in a Griggs-type deformation apparatus utilizing
              the molten salt cell to optimize the stress sensitivity of the apparatus.  ***
