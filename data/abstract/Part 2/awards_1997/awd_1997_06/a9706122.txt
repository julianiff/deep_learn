Abstract    :
              9706122  Rockwell    This research is to continue paleoseismic excavations at a
              site on the central Garlock fault in southern California that could potentially
              provide a longer record of prehistoric earthquakes than any site studied and
              published to date.  A long record of prehistoric earthquakes is critical for
              determining the distribution of earthquake recurrence intervals along faults
              and for placing constraints on physical models of earthquake recurrence.  In
              prior work, these scientists showed that the central Garlock fault has produced
              5-8 large earthquakes in the past 5145 years, on average at intervals of
              700-1230 years.  The radiocarbon ages of earthquakes exposed in the initial
              trench indicate that the recurrence intervals for the central Garlock fault are
              irregular and that earthquakes may be clustered in time.  This research will
              extend the earthquake record to 10-15 large earthquakes and better document the
              timing of all events.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake
              Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
