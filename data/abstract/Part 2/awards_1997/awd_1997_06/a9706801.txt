Abstract    :
              9706801  Byrne   The role of normal faulting in the exhumation of high-grade
              metamorphic rocks in convergent orogens is an important unsolved problem. 
              Taiwan provides a valuable opportunity to study the relation between
              contraction and extension and the processes of tectonic exhumation because the
              orogenic belt is active, and because the obliquity of the collision also
              results in a time-space equivalence that permits different veins of the
              orogenic belt as it evolves.  This project involves documentation of the
              distribution of contractional and extensional structures in southernmost Taiwan
              and testing of several proposed models.  Results will be applicable to
              regional-scale tectonics of Taiwan and to other convergent margins.
