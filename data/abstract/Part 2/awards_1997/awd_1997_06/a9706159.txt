Abstract    :
                   It has been a long-standing goal of both the Artificial  Intelligence and
              the Robotics communities to develop  physical artifacts that can act
              intelligently .  From the  Robotics side, the priority has been on the
              development of  mechanical agents that would exhibit navigation,  manipulation,
              perception, and action skills, along with the  ability to work cooperatively. 
              The results on low-level  control, including sensor uncertainty, limited
              reasoning  about geometric and physical properties, and skills like  object
              avoidance have proved interesting and useful, but  most autonomous robotic
              agents still lack the ability to  perform higher level intelligent operations
              either alone or  in concert.  This is partly because of their need to proceed 
              with reasonable expedience, while the known methods are  demonstrably very
              complex, and therefore slow.  It is hoped  that recent results in AI planning,
              learning, reasoning, and  cooperation among agents will help in bridging the
              gap  between high-level reasoning and low-level physical  execution.  The
              purpose of this workshop is to examine the  available results and research
              agenda in this `bridging`  area, while also establishing international links
              between  American and Brazilian researchers working in the same areas  and
              between NSF and its Brazilian counterpart organization  CNPq, which will
              provide support for the Brazilian  participants.
