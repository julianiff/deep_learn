Abstract    :
              9706086  Davidson  A comprehensive petrogenetic study of Damavand Volcano, a
              young, large-volume alkaline edifice located 50 km to the N.E. of Tehran, is
              proposed.  The volcano has developed subsequent to closure of the Tethyan
              ocean, and is now located in a region of active compression.  Isotope and trace
              element studies will enable the extent of interaction of magmas with the
              lithosphere to be determined.  When the effects of crustal modification have
              been accounted for, we hope to constrain the composition of primitive magmas,
              which may elucidate the nature of the mantle source (asthenosphere vs
              lithosphere).  This information will be needed to explain how and why magmatism
              occurs in some regions after subduction has ceased. The volcanological
              characteristics of  Damavand will also be studied, with a view to evaluating
              volcanic hazard potential - a goal that is of particular interest to our
              Iranian colleagues. This study is intended as a pilot.  It will facilitate the
              development of collaborative academic and logistical ties with scientists in
              Iran and will hopefully be followed by a broader investigation of magmatism
              associated  with the Tethyan closure in Iran.
