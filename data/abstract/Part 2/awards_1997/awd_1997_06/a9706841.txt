Abstract    :
              9706841  Levander    This is a renewal proposal for funds to support a
              postdoctoral  researcher at Rice University for the purpose of completing 
              analysis of active source data and earthquake data collected during  the Deep
              Probe experiment.  This experiment was conducted in 1995  by a group of U.S.
              universities (funded by NSF) and the Canadian  Lithoprobe Program.  The
              experiment consisted of a continental  scale active source seismic profile to
              probe the Archean upper  mantle beneath the Alberta plains, and the Phanerozoic
              mantle  beneath the southern Rocky Mountains and the Colorado Plateau.  The 
              profile extended from southern New Mexico to the Great Slave Lake.  ***
