Abstract    :
              9706091  Wagner    This research is to investigate the use of observations made
              at  small-aperture three-component seismic arrays as a means of  measuring
              spatial and temporal variations in subsurface  properties in active fault
              zones.  The motivation for this study  is based on the premise that the
              increase in stress which is  presumed to precede large to moderate sized
              earthquakes may lead  to changes is seismic parameters.  The parameters of
              particular  interest for this study are shear wave splitting, seismic coda 
              excitation and shear wave polarization.  The data will be  processed using a
              statistical array processing algorithm that  provides high-resolution estimates
              of the frequency, wavenumber  and polarization characteristics of the coherent
              arrivals  observed at the array.  This research is a component of the  National
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
