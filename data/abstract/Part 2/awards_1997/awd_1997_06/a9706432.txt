Abstract    :
              97-06432  Axen  One of the larger outstanding issues in plate tectonics concerns
              the initiation and evolution of continental rifting.  A second important
              problem relates to the understanding of the evolution of transform faulting to
              strongly oblique rifting.  The Gulf of Baja is the obvious natural laboratory
              for studying these problems because  it is in the early stages of its
              evolution, it is well exposed, and it is accessible.  Axen's study will
              contribute to our knowledge by providing an integrative data set including
              geological mapping, structural geology, and sedimentology,  all supported by
              geochronologic  work. By studying both the volcanic and the sedimentary rocks,
              as well as their structures and temporal relations, Axen's data will bear
              directly on the detailed geologic history of the evolution of the northern part
              of the Gulf of Baja.
