Abstract    :
              9706201  Song    This research involves the expansion of previous findings 
              concerning the differential rotation of the earth's inner core.  Waveform
              modeling and differential time measurements of core  phases (PKP) have
              successfully led to new insights on both the P-  wave anisotropy, structure and
              rotation of the inner core.  The  approach of using relative observations
              (waveforms, differential  times) with a common source eliminates the concern
              about  uncertainties in source origin time, excitation, mislocation, and 
              velocity uncertainties in the crust and upper mantle under the  source and
              receiver.  More differential data will be assembled to  invert the
              anisotropy/attenuation structure of the inner core in  a frame of a spinning
              inner core.  ***
