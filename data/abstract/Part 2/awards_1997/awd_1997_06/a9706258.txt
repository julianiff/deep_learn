Abstract    :
              9706258  Sorlien     A major problem of structural geology is the resolution of
              the role of faulting in the subsurface to folding at the surface.  This study
              of the North Channel Islands, CA will help address this question by an
              integrated study of marine terranes, (by mapping and age dating), and of
              seismic reflection mapping of profiles both in and near Santa Cruz and Anacapa
              Islands.  The results will allow the calculation of slip and slip rates on the 
              Channel Island Thrust, and help resolve the disparate interpretations of the
              activity and consequences of the Channel Island Thrust.
