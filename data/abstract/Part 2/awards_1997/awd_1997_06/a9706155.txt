Abstract    :
              9706155  Jones  The 8th National Conference on Wind Engineering will be held  on
              June 5-7, 1997, at the Homewood Campus, Johns Hopkins  University.  Held every
              four years this conference provides  a major forum for the exchange of
              information and discussion  of all recent developments in and applications of
              wind  engineering; for the assessment of the state-of-the-art; and  for
              recommending new venues and topics in wind engineering  research.  The program
              for the conference comprises theme  lectures, special lectures, regular papers
              and discussion  groups.  Support will be provided to graduate and 
              undergraduate students for attending the conference.  The  students interaction
              with national and international experts  as well as the exchanges between
              researchers and  practitioners is a source of great benefits to the wind 
              engineering research community.  ***
