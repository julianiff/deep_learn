Abstract    :
              Abstract  9706905  Richter    Richter and Sundberg will investigate the
              structure of the invariant subspace lattices of bounded analytic functions
              acting as multiplication operators on Banach or Hilbert spaces of analytic
              functions. The knowledge about the invariant subspaces of the unilateral shift
              (i.e. multiplication by z on the Hardy space of the unit disc) has been used
              via dilation and model theory to enhance our knowledge about contraction
              operators on Hilbert spaces. The spaces that will be considered include the
              Dirichlet and Bergman spaces of the unit disc. The operator theoretic questions
              that arise are naturally related to questions from classical analysis, such as
              questions about zero sets and sets of uniqueness.    The study of linear
              operators acting on Hilbert spaces can be viewed as an extension of linear
              algebra to an infinite dimensional setting. It has historical origins and
              applications in such fields as partial differential equations, fluid dynamics,
              and quantum mechanics. The   work of Richter and Sundberg is concerned with
              certain natural models for such operators. It is expected that a study of these
              models will yield insight into general structural properties of Hilbert space
              operators.
