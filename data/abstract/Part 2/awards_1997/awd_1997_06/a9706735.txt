Abstract    :
              9706735  Thomas    One of the fundamental  problems in early Paleozoic plate
              tectonic history of the Americas is where and how much the west coast of South
              America has interacted with the east coast of North America.  One of the ways
              to test possible interactions of the continents is by testing
              lithostratigraphic correlations of Cambrian and Ordovician rocks. Thomas' study
              will do exactly that:  compare and contrast the potential correlation of early
              Paleozoic sediments  in the southeastern US with those of northwestern
              Argentina.  The results will go a long way toward evaluating whether the
              correlations of these rocks permits a transfer in the Early Paleozoic of the
              Precordillera from Laurentia to Argentina .
