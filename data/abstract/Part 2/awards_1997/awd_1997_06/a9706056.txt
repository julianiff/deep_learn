Abstract    :
              9706056  Laske      This research involves a new global and regional analysis of
              seismic anisotropy using surface wave data.  The results of this study are
              expected to shed light on the nature of large-scale and medium-scale flow
              patterns in the oceanic mantle.  The compatibility of the data with anisotropy
              models developed for the continental lithosphere using shear-wave splitting
              data will also be studied.  It has been several years since the last
              large-scale study of anisotropy using surface waves and the potential datasets
              have expanded tremendously in the intervening time.  The critical feature which
              distinguishes this study from previous studies is the use of particle motion
              information as well as phase to discriminate anisotropic effects from those of
              lateral heterogeneities.    ***
