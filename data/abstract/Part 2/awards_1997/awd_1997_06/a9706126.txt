Abstract    :
              9706126  Reed  The Inorganic Geochemistry Gordon Research Conference, which
              addresses the geochemistry of metal ore-forming systems, has been held every
              three to four years over the past 28 years. This meeting serves as one of the
              principal conferences of international researchers that focus on the chemistry
              of ore metal transport and deposition.  It is anticipated that participants
              from academia , mining  industry and various government laboratories will be
              present again this year.  This proposal requests funds to pay on-site costs for
              students, assistant professors and other junior scientists to attend the Gordon
              Research Conference on Geochemistry of Metal Ore-forming Systems.  Support
              would be provided on a matching basis to those people who can substantially
              cover their own travel expenses from other sources.
