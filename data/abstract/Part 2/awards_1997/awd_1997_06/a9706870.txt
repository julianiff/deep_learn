Abstract    :
              9706870  Parvin    This project explores the magnetic behavior of carbon- 
              encapsulated magnetic particles.  The research involves  synthesis,
              purification, magnetic extraction, and structural  and magnetic
              characterization of the particles.  The  magnetic particles (carbon-coated
              alloys of iron-transition  metals, cobalt-transition metals, nickel-transition
              metals  and iron-rich rare earths)are synthesized in a modified low 
              carbon:metal ratio fullerene arc chamber in which the  formation of carbides
              are minimized.  Characterization of  the particles includes particle size
              distribution analysis  and composition, structural analysis using transmission 
              electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, and Mossbauer  spectroscopy. 
              Hysteritic and temperature-dependent magnetic  response is measured over a wide
              range of magnetic fields  and temperatures.  It is a collaborative project
              between San  Jose State University (particle characterization) and 
              Northwestern University (particle synthesis).  %%%  Carbon-encapsulated
              magnetic particles are of interest  because they combine corrosion protection
              from the carbon  coating and possible unique magnetic properties based on the 
              type of metal alloy encapsulated.  ***
