Abstract    :
              9706526  Hirschmann    Summary: The chemical differences in mid-ocean ridge
              basalts at one  location on a ridge and along a ridge have been noted for some 
              time. Various models of melting, mantle heterogeneity, melt  migration through
              the mantle have been proposed to explain these  differences. The PI
              hypothesizes that the differences are due to  the presence pyroxenite veins in
              the mantle that melt  preferentially and at greater depth than the bulk of the
              mantle.  Thus this small amount of material (about 5% of the mantle) could 
              contribute more than 20% of the melt that reaches the surface in  some places,
              thus causing the chemical differences seen in the  basalts. The PI plans to
              melt pyroxenites under mantle conditions  to determine the compositions of
              melts that might contribute to the  ocean ridge basalts.
