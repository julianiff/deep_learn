Abstract    :
              Abstract  WU    This project studies the higher index problem for Dirac
              operators on coverings of manifolds with boundary, with global boundary
              condition of Atiyah-Patodi-Singer type.   The main steps in solving this
              problem are: (1) Study a canonical boundary condition defined by the Calderon
              projector constructed from the bounding manifold.  (2) Reduce the K-theoretic
              index of the boundary value problem to the noncommutative spectral flow from
              the original bmundary condition to the Calderon projector.  These steps provide
              an identification of the boundary value index at the K-theory level. To get
              more explicit formulae for the index, one then needs to calculate the Chern
              character of the index in cyclic homology. Using the formula for the cyclic
              character for the spectral flows, this amounts to identifying the higher
              (cyclic) eta-invariant of the boundary Dirac and the Calderon projector in
              terms of the geometry of the bounding manifold.     A successful solution of
              the higher index problem would lead to many interesting applications in
              differential geometry and topology.  It also provides valuable theoretical
              understandings to the study of boundary value problems of elliptic partial
              differential equations arising from various applied scientific fields and
              engineering.
