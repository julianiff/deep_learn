Abstract    :
              9706708  Yager    This grant will use animations contained in the CD versions of
              the  modules that have been developed by COMET to support instructional 
              development by university personnel.  The goal is to develop a  resource of
              web-based teaching and learning activities that will be  available at no cost
              for educational use.  This grant will help  accomplish this goal by 1) Assemble
              an annotated catalog of COMET-  produced CD-ROM animations, 2) Make these
              animations available in  web-accessible formats for popular operating systems
              and 3)  Construct a few examples of web-based activities which use  animation
              to aid understanding of difficult concepts.
