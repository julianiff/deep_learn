Abstract    :
              9706677  Lesher  Breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea in the North Atlantic
              region during late Paleocene-early Eocene time was associated with widespread
              volcanism and formation of the North Atlantic Large Igneous Province (NA-LIP). 
              The aim of this project is to establish a high resolution petrographic and
              geochemical stratigraphy of subaerial portions of this volcanic province
              exposed along the Blosseville Coast of central East Greenland.  The new
              compositional stratigraphy will span the period of continental rifting and the
              start of seafloor spreading in the NA-LIP.   The results of this study will
              provide constraints for models of plume-initiated continental breakup and
              crustal architecture of the continent to ocean transition, and will increase
              our understanding of magma genesis, crustal evolution and the interplay between
              volcanic and tectonic activity during the emplacement of LIPs.  Methods to be
              employed in this study include optical and electron microscopy, X-ray
              fluorescence spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and
              solid-source mass spectrometry.
