Abstract    :
                    9706912  Nagylaki  The goal of this work is to contribute to the
              understanding of the genetic structure and evolution of natural populations. 
              The mathematical knowledge of the amount and pattern of genetic diversity under
              various conditions is essential for the motivation, design, and interpretation
              of experiments and field studies and for the investigation by computer of very
              complex systems.  Comparison of models with observations yields information
              about particular populations, and many such comparisons indicate the relative
              importance and conditions of action of the basic evolutionary forces.  The
              latter include natural selection, mutation, migration, and random fluctuations
              in the proportions of various genes.  All of these will be studied in this
              project.  The evolution of repeated DNA sequences under gene conversion (the
              non-reciprocal transfer of information between genes) will also be
              investigated.  In addition to its intrinsic interest and direct influence on
              empirical research, theoretical work suggests and assists less mathematical,
              more immediately data-oriented studies.  In the long run, studies of genetic
              variability of the type proposed here provide information that helps to
              preserve and manage wild animals and plants.  They also advance areas of the
              genetics of human populations that concern the frequency of genetic diseases,
              which are of immense medical importance.
