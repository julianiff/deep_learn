Abstract    :
              9706129  Carmichael  Previous work has determined that the phenocryst
              assemblages of andesitic lavas in western Mexico are strongly influenced by the
              concentrations of water that the magmas contain. Basalts and basaltic andesites
              from central Mexico may contain hornblende phenocrysts and it is proposed to
              quantify the P-T conditions, together with the water concentration in the
              liquids, in the regimes in which hornblende is stable. In addition, phenocrysts
              of pyroxene and olivine, often without plagioclase, will be used to constrain
              the water concentrations in basalts and basaltic andesites without hornblende.
              Ferric-ferrous ratios in the hornblendes will be calibrated with oxygen
              fugacity in an internally heated pressure vessel in which the rapid quench
              preserves the liquid as a glass. In addition, the geological age and
              environment of andesites-basalts in central Mexico are so poorly known that
              mapping and sampling will be completed in Zitacuaro region of Michoacan,
              Mexico.
