Abstract    :
              9706120  McCaffrey     This research is to study the February 17, 1996, M=8.2
              earthquake along the northwestern coast of Irian Jaya.  It is among the largest
              in recent times and occurred in a region considered to be relatively inactive,
              based on past seismicity, seismic reflection profiles in the new Guinea trench,
              and recent geodetic measurements.  The earthquake produced wide-spread
              destruction of coastal communities resulting largely from a tsunami and lesser
              effects from strong shaking.  The focal mechanism suggests that the earthquake
              was either caused by southward thrusting of the Pacific plate beneath the
              island of New Guinea or by steep rupture of the oceanic lithosphere beneath the
              New Guinea trench.  With supplemental funding from NSF to support field work,
              in March of 1996 the investigators operated a portable seismic network for 3
              weeks, reoccupied a GPS network, and made field estimates of coseismic
              subsidence from changes in high tide marks.  Islands around Biak are well
              distributed above the quake, providing a rare opportunity to study details of a
              great earthquake.  The first-order goal is to determine which plane ruptured
              during the main shock.  The tectonic setting provides also an opportunity to
              study the dynamic interaction of parallel thrust and strike-slip faults that
              display slip partitioning during the earthquake sequence.  This grant funds the
              analysis of the data collected, analysis of the main shock and larger
              aftershocks, and an additional occupation of the GPS network to help separate
              coseismic slip from the rapid interseismic slip and to compare slip late in one
              quake cycle to that early in the next, and to interpret the significance of
              this great earthquake and its aftershocks.  ***
