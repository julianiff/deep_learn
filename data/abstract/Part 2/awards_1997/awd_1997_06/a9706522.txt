Abstract    :
              9706522      The large lakes of East Africa are sensitive monitors of
              continental-scale tropical hydrology that provide long continuous decadal-scale
              archives of water balance and temperature to test evolving models of tropical
              ocean moisture transport.  Our problems is to read and quantify such
              signatures.  Prior studies in the region have lacked the tools necessary to
              unequivocally separate temperature and precipitation effects.  In contrast,
              this study proposes to apply new techniques of oxygen and hydrogen isotopic
              analyses of aquatic cellulose and lipids that will allow us to differentiate
              the precipitation signal.  The objectives are to quantify the magnitude and
              timing of shifts in the water balances of Lakes Albert, Edward, and Victoria
              over the last 15,000 years and determine their implications for the local and
              regional biosphere.  The time-series  of water dynamics in these lakes will
              also be compared with the history of vegetation and civilization along the
              Nile.    The workplan includes compilation of a modern terrestrial and aquatic
              cellulose/ 18O database to confirm the temperature-independent and
              species-independent oxygen isotopic biochemical fractionation factor of aquatic
              cellulose.  This database will be used to constrain paleohydrologic
              interpretations.  Analyses of available core samples from all three lakes at
              less than 300 year increments will provide aquatic cellulose and hence lake
              water oxygen isotopic time-series profiles over the last 15,000 years.  These
              primary oxygen isotopic signals of the lake waters will derive from shifts in
              P:E ratios and residence times with negligible groundwater and high mountain
              water effects.  Additional analyses in aquatic lipids are expected to reflect 
              D values of the lake water.  Careful consideration of interactions between the
              watershed and lake water hydrologies as well as of past ocean isotopic values
              may allow testing for the history of moisture sources (Atlantic vs. Indian
              Ocean) to these basin.  This study should provide sensi tive new approaches to
              the study of paleohydrology in tropical regions and help constrain paleoclimate
              model predictions.
