Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to determine the feasibility of several technologies
               and associated design techniques in the development of an end-to-end optical
              data  path for use in interconnecting processors and a massively-parallel
              processing  system.  Some of the optical components proposed for use in the
              data path, such  as polymer waveguides, optical switches, and fiber/waveguide
              couplings, have been  shown to operate individually.  This project will
              construct and characterize  several end-to-end systems using these components. 
              The work will proceed in  phases, in which a data path is first built up from
              discrete purchased  components, then individual components are replaced with an
              integrated substrate  that uses polymer waveguides to interconnect sources,
              switches, and detectors.
