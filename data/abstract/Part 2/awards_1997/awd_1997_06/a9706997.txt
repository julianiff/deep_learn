Abstract    :
              9706997  Herrero-Bervera    The PI proposes a study of  geomagnetic polarity
              transitions recorded by lava flows of Wai'anae volcano.  The PI has located and
              studied in detail two geomagnetic polarity transition boundaries in sections of
              the Wai'anae Volcano.  Preliminary dating and measurements of the polarity of
              the   transitions are consistent with the Gilbert-Gauss (R-N), Lower (N-R) and
              Upper Mammoth, Lower and Upper Kaena transitions.  Samples will be dated
              further using K-Ar and Ar/Ar techniques to confirm this correlation. 
              Progressive alternating-field demagnetization has been   completed on
              preliminary samples drilled at widely-spaced vertical intervals in both
              sections to remove major lightning-induced and viscous secondary components
              efficiently, revealing well-grouped flow means.  The PI will sample five
              transitional sections in detail and will complete a   study of the
              magnetostratigraphy and polarity of the transitional fields.  This work should
              help constrain the geometry of the geomagnetic field during polarity
              transitions.  ***
