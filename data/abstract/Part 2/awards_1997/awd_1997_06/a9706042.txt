Abstract    :
               This research examines the causes and consequences of military practices in
              contact-era highland New Guinea.  Drawing on data from 180 societies, the
              project will use a regional comparative methodology to examine how military
              practices are affected by physical, demographic, social and cultural
              conditions, and how military practice influences settlement patterns, social
              structure, local community formation, gender ideology, clan structure, art and
              ritual production. The investigator, a cultural anthropologist at the
              University of Maine, will consult archival materials in Australia, Germany, the
              Netherlands, Papua New Guinea, and the U.S.  The project represents a major
              synthesis of our knowledge of the peoples and cultures of this area of the
              world.  The research will result in a computerized textual database of 180 New
              Guinea societies, and two computerized, coded databases, usable by other
              researchers, of quantitative and qualitative information for about 1,500 local
              communities.   This research is important because it will advance our
              understanding of how tribal warfare differs from modern or `civilized` war. 
              The knowledge created by this research will be a valuable resource for
              commentators who wish to discuss the role of warfare and the nature of
              humankind.
