Abstract    :
              9706427  Isacks  One of the newest and most exciting methods of detecting
              displacements is through selected aperture radar (SAR) interferometry. This
              method has been used selectively to identify small displacements over
              relatively large areas by comparing  'scenes' of the same area made at
              different times.  Displacements of the land surface between the times of the
              images can then be identified by difference. One of the problems that arises in
              the method in interference from variable atmospheric conditions.  This proposal
              will explore the application of SAR to an arid region near the Chile-Peru
              border, where the climate is unusually constant and arid, and where major
              earthquakes are predicted within the next few years. The results of this study
              will contribute to the development of the technique, and to an understanding of
              interseismic strain an a convergent plate boundary region.
