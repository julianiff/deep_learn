Abstract    :
              9706344  Bogue    The PI proposes a pilot paleomagnetic investigation of a
              volcanic sequence that was erupted during a polarity reversal of the
              geomagnetic field 15.2 million years ago.  The study area is a 200m thick
              section of basaltic-andesitic lava flows exposed in the Sheep Creek Range,
              Nevada.  In the pilot study the PI will determine the completeness of the
              record in this newly-discovered transition zone and whether paleointensities
              can be determined from the lavas.  Scientific questions to be addressed include
              whether the directional change was complex or simple during the polarity
              reversal, what was the field strength after the reversal, and whether the field
              strength was steady or variable during intervals when the apparent pole
              position was stationary.  The answers to these questions will address hotly
              debated issues related to the nature of the transitional geomagnetic field.
