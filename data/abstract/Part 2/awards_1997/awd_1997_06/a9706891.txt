Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT DMS-9706891    Nussbaum      Nussbaum proposes research to gain insight
              into the solutions of   nonlinear functional differential equations or "FDE's".
               Functional   differential equations are equations in which the derivative of a
                function x(t) is a specified function of the history of x up to   time t. An
              example which plays a central role in this  proposal is ax'(t)=f(x(t),x(t-r)),
              r=r(x(t)). Here f and r are   specified functions, and a is a positive real.
              Under natural   assumptions on f and r and for a small, there exists a slowly 
              oscillating periodic solution x(t), dependent on a. Nussbaum will  seek to
              describe precisely the limiting shape of the graph of this  solution x(t) as a
              approaches zero.      Nonlinear functional differential equations (sometimes
              called  differential-delay equations) have been suggested as models in a 
              variety of areas, particularly in biology. For example, A. Longtin   and J.
              Milton propose such equations in studying the human eye's  pupil-light reflex;
              and M. Mackey and J. Milton are led to consider  nonlinear FDE's in their
              studies of oscillations in the human body's  red blood cell population.
              Considered from a pure mathematician's  viewpoint, the equations which arise
              are highly nontrivial. In this  proposal,  Nussbaum studies classes of
              nonlinear FDE's which are,   in part, motivated by examples from biology; and
              we seek to understand the  behaviour of solutions of such equations.
