Abstract    :
              9706107  Zhang  One of the basic aims of igneous and metamorphic petrology is to
              infer the thermal history of rocks using observed mineral assemblages and
              compositions.  This continuing award will support research in reaction kinetics
              and geospeedometry, concentrating on using kinetics of homogeneous reactions
              (i.e., reactions in a single phase) to infer thermal history.  The focus will
              be on the reaction of hydrous species interconversion (H2Om+O= 2OH) in volcanic
              glasses, not only because of its importance in geospeedometry, but also because
              H2O is the most abundant volatile component in the earth and plays the critical
              role in explosive volcanic eruptions and in physical and chemical properties of
              melts.  Previous research provided a geospeedometer and allows the
              determination of the cooling rate of hydrous volcanic glasses through IR
              analyses.  Some of the unexpected problems encountered this previous work
              (e.g., the need for a new calibration) have been partially addressed.  With
              this continuing award:  (1) the IR technique will be calibrated to high total
              H2O content - the calibration is basic to the proposed work and that of others
              on hydrous systems; (2) in situ experimental studies at high temperature and
              pressure on speciation and kinetics of the reaction will be carried out; and
              (3) cooling rate profiles in natural and experimental hydrous glasses will be
              determined.
