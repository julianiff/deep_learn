Abstract    :
              9706681  Chave    Due to the recent turndown of analog submarine telephone
              cables by  their commercial operators, an opportunity has arisen to make 
              planetary scale measurements of the geoelectric field on unpowered  cables
              around the globe.  At present, such data are being  collected on two Atlantic
              and nine Pacific  cables by US and Japanese investigators; the record length is
               currently two to seven years.  The proposed work is to use these  data,
              together with geomagnetic variations measurements from  standard observatories
              and dedicated magnetometers, to study the  vertical and lateral variability of 
              the deep (100-600 km) electrical structure of the sub-oceanic  mantle beneath
              the Atlantic and Pacific with a resolution  comparable to that from seismic
              normal modes.  The oceanic  structure will be compared to that beneath an
              Archaean craton in  central Canada, and a petrophysical interpretation for the 
              differences will be devised.  ***
