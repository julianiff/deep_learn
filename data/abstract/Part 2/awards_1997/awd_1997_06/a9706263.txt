Abstract    :
              9706263  Hervig  Melt inclusions allow the possibility of determining the
              variation of volatiles in magmatic processes and provide greater analytical
              resolution than bulk analyses.  Using melt inclusions, it may be possible to
              test current models of arc volcanism by looking at relationships between
              volatiles and key trace elements.  In this study, electron probe, SIMS, and
              FTIR microanalysis of melt inclusions will be utilized to isolate the role of
              volatiles and sediment-derived trace elements in melt inclusions in Nicaraguan
              volcanoes associated with subduction regimes having  high slab input.
