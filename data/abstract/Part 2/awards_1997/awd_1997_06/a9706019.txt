Abstract    :
              9706019  Tauxe    The PIs will study the variability of the intensity of Earth's
              magnetic field using sedimentary records.  Investigations of the Oligocene
              sequence of sediments recovered during Leg 73 at Hole 522 in the South Atlantic
              produced relative paleointensity data of high quality that allow specific  
              predictions to be made about the long term behavior of the geomagnetic field in
              ancient times.  Those data suggest that the average paleofield intensity is
              related to reversal frequency and that the variability of the data is
              proportional to the mean intensity.  If these observations can be   verified
              elsewhere, they provide profound constraints on the process which generates the
              field, and in this study, the PIs will continue this work in the Paleogene. 
              They will focus on generating records from latitudinally distributed locations
              for two time slices in the Oligocene from  DSDP/ODP cores and will test whether
              sedimentary sequences can be found that preserve a record of the field.  They
              will also perform a feasibility study on Italian limestone sequences to
              investigate possible changes in paleointensity near the Cretaceous Normal
              Superchron, which is suggested by a statistical study of the Oligocene data
              from Hole 533.  ***
