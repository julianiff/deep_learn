Abstract    :
              9706177  Bumgardner  This award provides partial support for the Southern 
              Biomedical Engineering Conference, April 4-6, 1997, to  acquire, install, and
              begin the operation of a computer  server connected to the World Wide Web, a
              part of the  Internet.  The server would give access to the audio and  visual
              displays of the plenary presentations and the  abstracts of the scientific
              papers read at the meeting.  The  system is to be linked to other biomedical
              engineering  programs and resources such as BMEnet.  The conference 
              proceedings thereby would be made available world wide at no  cost to the user.
                 The system will be used by the organizers of future Southern  Biomedical
              Engineering Conferences for program planning and  post-conference information
              dissemination.  System  maintenance will be managed by the Agricultural and 
              Biological Engineering Department of Mississippi State  University.  ***
