Abstract    :
              Our present understanding of how the face of primates (including humans) is
              strained and stressed during mastication (chewing) is poor.  Consequently, we
              do not know to what extent primate cranial and facial form is related to
              masticatory function. Two fundamental questions have yet to be answered: how
              are the bones of the face strained during chewing, and how are masticatory
              forces distributed through the face?  Most attempts to model the behavior of
              the face have used beam theory. The research proposed here evaluates hypotheses
              regarding how the face is deformed (strained) during chewing and biting by (a)
              measuring bone strain magnitudes and orientations in and around the orbits of
              macaques,  (b) relating these bone strain patterns to muscle activity recorded
              simultaneously from the masticatory muscles, and (c) using these data to
              develop finite-element models of the behavior of the macaque circumorbital
              skeleton.   This research will further our understanding of primate
              cranio-facial biomechanics, enabling hypotheses regarding the functional
              significance of primate cranio-facial evolution to be addressed.  It also
              promises to improve our understanding of human cranio-facial functioning.
