Abstract    :
              9706210  O'Connell    The proposed research is to study flow and thermal
              convection in  the mantle.  The work will involve thermal convection 
              calculations for a spherical Earth model that incorporates the  geometry and
              motions of lithospheric plates and is constrained by  seismic tomographic
              models of mantle heterogeneity.  The changes  of plate geometry and motions
              over the last 150 My, and the  evolution of the internal heterogeneity and
              thermal fields are  also included in the model. The work extends recent mantle
              flow  models that predict the motions of mantle plumes and hot--spots  and
              resolve some problems with plate motions.  The models also  predict the motion
              of the  rotation axis, which compares well with paleomagnetic  observations of
              polar wander.  The current work will incorporate  thermal convection effects
              into the models.  This will constitute  a self consistent dynamic investigation
              of plumes, hotspots, the  geoid, and forces on lithospheric plates.  ***
