Abstract    :
              9706688  Bergman    The PI proposes a three year laboratory study of the 
              acoustics of directionally solidified metallic alloys.  The  effort will
              involve examining in detail solidification  texturing as a possible mechanism
              for understanding the  inferred seismic anisotropy of the Earth's inner core. 
              Preliminary ultrasonic measurements by the PI have  demonstrated that
              rectionally solidified metallic alloys can  exhibit a significant acoustic
              anisotropy due to  solidification texturing.  ***
