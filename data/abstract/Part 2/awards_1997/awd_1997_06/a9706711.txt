Abstract    :
              9706711  Batiza                This award provides partial funding for the
              support of a  laboratory manager of the University of Hawaii ICP-MS 
              (inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometer) facility in the  School of Ocean
              and Earth Sciences and Technology. The ICP-MS  laboratory provides analyses of
              solid silicate and carbonate  samples, as well as of ocean and other fluid
              samples for a number  of research and teaching groups at the University. A new
              ICP-MS  instrument was recently installed, and this award is intended to 
              provide partial support for the technical operation of the  laboratory for a
              limited period of 18 months until the University  of Hawaii will be able to
              provide support from its own resources.  ***
