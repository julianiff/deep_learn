Abstract    :
              9706641    Pipher      This project is concerned with the applications of
              techniques  of harmonic analysis to various problems in linear elliptic 
              theory. It uses Littlewood-Paley theory to study boundary value  problems for
              second order divergence form equations, in   particular for equations with
              non-smooth coefficients and/or  whose matrix is not assumed to be real-valued
              or symmetric.  There are close connections to linear problems in non-smooth 
              domains. Thus, included in this project is the study of   higher order elliptic
              operators in domains with Lipschitz  boundary. In particular, it treats
              boundary problems with  data in Sobolev spaces or Hardy spaces.      There are
              many problems arising in various areas of mathematics,  physics, engineering,
              and manufacturing which reduce to being  able to approximate solutions of
              linear partial differential  equations in regions which have corners and edges.
              This  phenomenon, the presence of corners and edges, causes inherent 
              mathematical difficulties in obtaining good approximations.   In particular, it
              is important to be able to measure how small  the error will be in terms of the
              data (the known quantities).  This project is concerned with formulating the
              theory upon  which these numerical approximations and applications are   based.
