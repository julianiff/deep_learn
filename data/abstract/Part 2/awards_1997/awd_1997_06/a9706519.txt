Abstract    :
              9706519  Reid  Large, highly explosive eruptions reflect the accumulation of
              magma at shallow crustal levels, which in turn, requires a heat input
              significantly in excess of output.  The duration of magma accumulation and
              compositional modification is therefore a record of the thermal history of a
              volcano which, for voluminous rhyolitic magmas, may operate over timescales of
              tens of thousands to millions of years.  To delimit the dynamics of magma
              accumulation, three new methods for dating the crystallization of minerals from
              rhyolitic magmas will be refined and employed.  Two of these methods will
              utilize a high resolution ion microprobe which will enable individual zircon
              and allanite crystals to be dated and a detailed record of crystal growth to be
              obtained.  The third method will determine the timing of quartz crystallization
              from age of the glass inclusions they contain. Major centers of rhyolitic
              volcanism, including Long Valley (California), Yellowstone (Wyoming), and Toba
              (Sumatra) calderas, will be investigated. The insights gathered from these
              studies will be used in conjunction with the temperature-dependence of
              crystallization to develop models for the thermal evolution of rhyolitic magmas
              associated with large-volume silicic systems.
