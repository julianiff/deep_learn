Abstract    :
              9706623  Puente    The final goal of this work is to study the possibility of
              studying the dynamics of transport in porous media based on a compact geometric
              representation of evolving plumes.  The approach  is motivated by the fact that
              most current (stochastic) transport models, by relying on averaging procedures
              to transfer uncertainties due to porous media heterogeneities, often lead to
              unreliable predictions which do not preserve the non-elliptical and generally
              tangled geometries that natural plumes have.  Guided by the success in using
              the fractal-multifractal, FM, representation, developed by the proposer
              (Puente, 1992, 1994, 1995), to study the dynamics of vertically-averaged
              chloride as measured at the Borden Site in Ontario, Canada, this works seeks to
              further study the capabilities of such a procedure in encoding two and three
              dimensional natural plumes.  The tasks that shall be undertaken during the
              first year are:     (a) geometric encoding of vertically-averaged bromide
              concentration patterns as measured at the Cape Cod site,  (b)    compact
              parameterization of whole three-dimensional plumes at the Cape Cod site via
              extensions of the FM approach    One such tasks are performed the information
              they provide, in terms of geometric surrogate parameters, shall be used (later
              on) to study the dynamics of the plume.  Throughout the study, research will
              continue on the use of sophisticated search algorithms for the efficient
              solving of the inverse problem which defines surrogate parameters at a given
              time.
