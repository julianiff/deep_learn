Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    97-06880  Moran  RUI: The relative strength of top-down and
              bottom-up forces in old-field arthropod communities.    Top-down regulation of
              a food chain refers to how predators control the populations of other species,
              while bottom-up regulation refers to how resources such as minerals and water
              affect the organisms and their interactions.  This study will be conducted on
              the arthropods (insects, spiders, and others) that inhabit fields.  Arthropods
              are often the dominant species in fields and therefore are important in
              understanding how natural communities are controlled. Top-down and bottom-up
              processes are present in all communties, but the importance of each is not
              well-understood for places with high numbers of species. This study will begin
              to address this question by manipulating resources and the level of predation
              simultaneously to determine the predominant force in an arthropod community.
