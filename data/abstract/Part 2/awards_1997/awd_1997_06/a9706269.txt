Abstract    :
              9706269  Burbank   Folds are fundamental structures of contractional orogens,
              but because timing and increments of folding are parameters that commonly are
              not possible to determine unambiguously, the kinematic history of fold
              development in a orogen is difficult to establish.  This information is needed
              to make reliable reconstructions of how orogens develop.  This project will
              attack this problem by using a set of folds in NE Spain where deposition caused
              strata to be deposited during fold amplification, such that each growth strata
              recorded different amounts of folding.  By step-wise unfolding keyed to the
              growth strata, and obtaining age control by various means.  The sequential
              development of these folds can be constructed, successful results should help
              understand the role of folds in developing orogens.
