Abstract    :
              9706251  Rutherford  The phenocryst phases present in a subvolcanic magma, and
              the properties of the magma are controlled in part by the C-O-S volatile
              dissolved in the melt phase.  In addition, exsolution of gas in subvolcanic
              magma systems will also affect their physical properties and related magmatic
              processes such as convection, eruption dynamics, magma degassing, and metal
              transport.   The research to be conducted with this award is designed to
              understand (1) the controls on gas species solubility, (2) the composition of 
              the excess gas phase, and (3) the effects these volatiles have on  volcanic
              processes.  The work involve experiments on natural volcanic rock compositions
              ranging from dacites such as those erupted from Mt. Pinatubo in 1991 to
              calc-alkaline and alkaline basalts.  The third task involves a study if Mt.
              Vesuvius volcanic processes.
