Abstract    :
              9706104  Manning  This is a collaborative project between Essene, Manning and
              Riciputi. Key chemical reactions involving Zr and Ti in garnets will be
              calibrated both empirically and experimentally as thermobarometers and applied
              to zoned garnets in various metamorphic terranes.  Empirical calibration of GZQ
              and GRQ using measured Zr and Ti levels from SIMS data for buffered New England
              garnets will be combined with thermodynamic estimations and calculations to
              yield provisional phase diagrams. The GZQ reaction will be calibrated
              experimentally with a piston-cylinder apparatus at UCLA (Manning) with
              compositional reversals and analysis of run products by Oak Ridge SIMS
              (Riciputi). Experiments on garnet-rutile-quartz and
              garnet-rutile-corumdum-sillimanite that have already been conducted by Manning,
              Bohlen and coworkers will be evaluated with the electron microprobe for their
              applicability to calibration of GRQ. Empirical calibration of KD thermometry
              for REE's and Y will be undertaken for selected garnet-monazite and
              garnet-epidote pairs from Greenville terrane and from New England using SIMS
              and EMP data. Combination of GZQ and GRQ barometry with REE KD thermometry
              offers a strong potential for obtaining more complete P-T-t paths experienced
              by granulite terranes and should elucidate mechanisms responsible for granulite
              facies genesis.
