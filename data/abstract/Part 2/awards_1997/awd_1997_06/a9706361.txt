Abstract    :
               This research project examines the evolutionary genetics of a group of New
              World primates.  The goals of the study include a reconstruction of the ancient
              invasion of Central America by howler monkeys and, as a secondary objective, a
              genetic analysis of social structure in a well-studied population of mantled
              howlers.  These objectives will be accomplished by comparing the genetic
              similarities between pairs of populations and pairs of individuals,
              respectively, using a DNA fingerprinting technology we developed specifically
              for these species.   This study will significantly augment our understanding of
              primate evolution in two ways.  First, we will provide a preliminary model for
              the population genetics of Central American primates in general, thus,
              providing a useful contrast with better known primate systems from Africa and
              Asia.  Second, the information generated by this study about New World primate
              genetics will provide basic information that can lay the foundation for future
              ecological and evolutionary studies in this group.
