Abstract    :
              9706804  Usiskin    The University of Chicago in the summer of 1998 is
              organizing its fourth international conference on mathematics education.   The
              purpose of the conference is to provide American mathematics educators with an
              opportunity to learn more about world-class materials and methods, and to
              promote scholarly contacts in a forum for discussion across international
              lines.  The major themes of the conference are: mathematics for all;
              performance; and educational technology.  The performance theme is the focus of
              discussions of participants from countries whose students performed well on the
              TIMSS tests.
