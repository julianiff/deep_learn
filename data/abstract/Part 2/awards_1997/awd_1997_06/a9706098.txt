Abstract    :
              9706098  Lewis        TOGA-COARE (for Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere Coupled
              Ocean-  Atmosphere Response Experiment) was a observational field project
              conducted in  the warm pool area of the western tropical Pacific Ocean.  Some
              of the observations  span several years in the early 1990s.  Most are derived
              from an intensive observing  period of 4 months in winter, 1993.  It was a
              joint ocean/atmosphere project with the  focused goal of collecting the
              observations relevant to air-sea interactions and the  physical processes that
              couple the ocean and atmosphere in the region of the world.        One of the
              objectives of the TOGA-COARE is to determine the principal  atmospheric
              processes that organize convection in the Western Pacific warm pool  region. 
              To accomplish this objective, the Principal Investigator will derive vertical 
              motions, momentum transports, and heat budgets for different types of oceanic 
              mesoscale convective systems (MCSs).  She will relate these physical quantities
              to  different characteristics of mesoscale convective systems (MCS) including
              the modes  of convection, evolution and boundary layer modification.  The
              research will focus  on the combined use of in situ and Doppler radar
              measurements from multiple  aircraft including the use of a relatively new
              Doppler synthesis technique, quad-  Doppler.          Four distinct cases (Feb.
              6, Feb. 9, Feb. 20, Feb. 22) have been chosen for  comparison.  Each of the
              four systems represent different types of MCS  organizational structure.  The
              exceptional quality of the winds, due to the quad-  Doppler technique, will be
              an asset for calculating the heat flux. The impact of the  different types of
              MCSs on the larger scale structure will be examined.  ***
