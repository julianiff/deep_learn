Abstract    :
              9706053  Hasan  A workshop entitled "The Frontiers of Applications of
              Photospectral Holeburning" is proposed to discuss issues related to both, the
              state of the applications of PSHB, as well as future directions in research,
              education, and training required for the marketing of PSHB based technology.
              The demonstrations of photospectral holeburning (PSHB) applications such as
              several gigabits per square inch memory storage and fast page oriented image
              storage with random frame access have established a definite superiority of
              this emerging technology over the existing ones. There is now, more than ever,
              a need to coordinate the activities of science, engineering, and technology
              community to systematically approach well defined goals in order to bring the
              PSHB technology to the marketplace. The proposed workshop is expected to foster
              an atmosphere of collective and coordinated effort between system engineers,
              optical scientists, material scientists, researchers and the end users at an
              international level to form a strategy to develop and exploit the PSHB based
              technology. In order to meet these goals selected 30-40 scientist and engineers
              will be invited to this workshop to be convened in Big Sky, Montana, Feb.
              16-19,1997. The meeting has been organized with a view to encourage
              participation and to stimulate the interest of graduate students in the PSHB
              research and technology to meet the future demand of a well educated and
              trained research and development community. Several travel grants will be
              awarded to the students participating in the workshop on a competitive basis. 
              The workshop is co-sponsored by NSF and AFOSR.
