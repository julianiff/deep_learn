Abstract    :
              SBR-9707648     At the end of September 1996, an earthquake of magnitude 5.0
              preceded an eruption of the Grimsvotn volcano, beneath Vatnajokull, Europe's
              largest glacier, in SE Iceland.  Glacial meltwater drained into a subglacial
              lake.  An early November earthquake resulted in a tremendous flood of meltwater
              (such a flood is called a Jokulhlaup in Icelandic and to the relevant
              scientific community).  The November Jokulhaup had an estimated peak flow of
              45,000 cubic meters per second, compared to regular (5-10-year) flows of 3,000
              cubic meters per second.  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)
              entails investigation of the geomorphic impacts of such a massive, sudden
              flood, toward the larger purpose of improving paleo-hydrologic models of flood
              events based only on the post-flood geomorphology.  The research supported
              entails the use of remotely sensed data to estimate the total flood discharge,
              measure pre- and post-flood digital elevation models and sediment patterns in
              the outwash plain (sandur), and identify the appropriate field sites for field
              measurement.  Spectral mixture analysis will be used to estimate the
              concentration and composition of sediment in the flood water.  The summer field
              work, conducted by the PI along with colleagues Francis Magilligan at Dartmouth
              College, Leal A.K. Mertes at UC-Santa Barbara, and Laurence C. Smith at UCLA,
              will test the accuracy of the digital elevation models and obtain information
              of the nature, type, and distribution of sediment deposits on the surface of
              the sandur.  Subsequent work will model the relationship between hydrologic
              energy of the flood (extrapolated from the volume estimates and the temporal
              record) and the nature and magnitude of the geomorphic change.  This work
              complements several other studies by international scientists on the nature of
              the flooding and the rates of geomorphic change, but not on the specific
              relationships among flood energy, sediment suspension, sedimentation, and
              geomorphic change.     The basis for th is award as a SGER is the necessity of
              a relatively rapid request to NASA to plan a special geodetic airborne laser
              resurvey of the sandur surface in March-April 1997.
