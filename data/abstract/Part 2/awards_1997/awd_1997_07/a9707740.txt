Abstract    :
              The Department of Statistics at Iowa State University will purchase computing
              equipment which will be dedicated to the support of computer-intensive research
              projects in the Department. In particular, the projects to be supported
              involve:  Inferences for the extremes in a vector of parameters; estimation and
              prediction for time series; interval analysis in statistical computing;
              statistical methods for correlated event time data; and facilitation of the
              appropriate use of physical model.
