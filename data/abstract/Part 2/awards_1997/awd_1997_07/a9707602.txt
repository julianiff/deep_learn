Abstract    :
              9707602  Ketterson    This award will provide funds that will be matched by the
              American Ornithologist's Union (AOU) and used to help defray part of the travel
              costs of U.S. scientists to attend the XXIInd International Ornithological
              Congress to be held in Durban, South Africa, in August of 1998.  The award will
              help allow U.S. scientists to attend numerous plenary lectures and symposia,
              and to participate as speakers in these and other sessions (e.g., contributed
              papers, round-table discussions) at the Congress.  In addition, participation
              by U.S. scientists will facilitate exchange of new information and foster
              collaborative-international agreements.  Selection procedures for awards from
              the AOU are in place, and attempts will be made to support younger scientists. 
              Because awards by the AOU to individual scientists are fairly small, the NSF
              award could be used to help defray tavel costs for more than 30 scientists.
