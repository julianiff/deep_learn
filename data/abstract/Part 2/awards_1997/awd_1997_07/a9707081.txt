Abstract    :
              The grant known as "Preservation and Cataloging of Siebert  Linguistic
              Materials" is of great importance to Native  American Linguistics.   This
              project is dedicated to working  with the legendary Dr. Frank T. Siebert in the
              organization,  dissemination and publication of his Native American  research. 
               Dr. Siebert's knowledge of Penobscot and Catawba  linguistics and culture is
              unsurpassed.   The  reconstruction, interpretation and editing of Dr. Siebert's
               notes, recordings and field work with his supervision are  paramount to the
              success of this project. The two main  priorities of this project are: 1) The
              Penobscot Dictionary;  retyping the dictionary, adding additional vocabulary
              from  the Penobscot Legends I and II, proofing of Penobscot and  English
              translations and publication. 2) The Penobscot  Legends Volume II; editing,
              layout, and publishing,  including accompanying audio compact disc.  In
              addition  archiving and cataloging of linguistic related papers will  continue.
               Translation of Catawba stories and other Native  American field work will take
              place as time allows.    Collaborations with Dr. Jim Peterson, Dr. Robert
              Leavitt and  Dr. Blair Rudes will be ongoing. Preservation and  dissemination
              of information remain the essence of this  project.
