Abstract    :
              A one day meeting, called the East Coast Computer Algebra Day,  will be held at
              Northeastern University, Boston, on Saturday, May  3, 1997.  The purpose of
              this meeting is to stimulate interest in  and enhance understanding of the
              technical aspects of computer  algebra, by providing a way for those in the
              region who are  active or interested in becoming more active in computer
              algebra  to meet with each other in an inexpensive and easily accessible  way. 
              This meeting will be more informal than the annual ISSAC  meetings, with ample
              time for unstructured interaction.  Participation by the region's graduate
              students will be  particularly encouraged through special invitation to
              contribute  to the poster sessions, and through travel support.  In addition, 
              the offer to fund travel and hotel for graduate students makes  this is an
              important opportunity to attract more women and  minorities into the computer
              algebra community.  For many  professionals and graduate students on the East
              Coast, the  current meeting represents the most accessible opportunity over 
              two years to meet with a significant portion of the computer  algebra
              community.  Both ISSAC and IMACS (major computer algebra  meetings) were held
              in Europe last year, and will be held in  Hawaii in summer, 1997.  Northeastern
              University is inside Boston  itself, with excellent mass transportation,
              including subway  connections to bus, train and plane.    Three invited
              speakers will anchor the meeting and will help  attract participants.  The
              invited talks and poster sessions  contributed by the community will cover the
              breadth of computer  algebra: algorithms, software, and applications.
