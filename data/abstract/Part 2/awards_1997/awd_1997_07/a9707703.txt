Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics and the Institute of Mathematical Sciences at the
              State University of New York at Stony Brook will  purchase computer equipment
              which will be dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical
              sciences. The equipment will be used  for several research projects in
              mathematics, including in particular:    computing examples in Riemannian
              geometry;    moving current investigations in rational dynamics from one to
              higher dimensions    finding explicit examples of positive area Julia sets   
              investigating the algebraic structures arising from Nambu mechanics and
              quantization via symbolic computations
