Abstract    :
              9707131  McDuff        The R/V THOMPSON has a schedule of 265 operational  days 
              in 1997  of  which 94 are in support of NSF-sponsored  programs.  In 1997  the 
              vessel will act as the support ship  for a  variety  of scientific programs 
              requiring the use of  the  deep  submergence remotely operated vehicles.  Of
              the  15 THOMPSON cruises  10  will require  the use of the ROV  JASON, incuding
              cruises for  the  UK, Washington State,  NOAA and NSF (6 cruises).  The
              remaining 5 cruises are in  support of programs for State of Washington,  Navy
              and  NSF  (2).  The THOMPSON will undergo a Navy INSURV inspection in  the last
              quarter of the year.        The R/V BARNES is scheduled for a total of 134 days
              in  1997 of  which  106  operational days are in support of  NSF-sponsored
              programs. The NSF days include 57 days off the  Columbia River (Oregon) in
              support of the LMER program.  The  remainder of the work is in Puget Sound.    
                The THOMPSON and BARNES are part of a fleet of ships  used by the  National 
              Science Foundation in support  of  marine  science research.  Most
              oceanographic projects  require highly specialized equipment permanently
              installed  on the vessel, thus the necessity for  specialized ships.  These
              vessels do not operate in the same mode  as  general  cargo/fishing vessels, as
              a result NSF supports the  operation of a variety of vessels specifically
              dedicated  to  oceanographic  research  that are operated  by  universities 
              and institutions around the country.  ***
