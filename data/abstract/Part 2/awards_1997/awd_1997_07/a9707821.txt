Abstract    :
              9707821  Thompson        The  University  of Texas will operate the Research 
              Vessel LONGHORN during 1997 as a general oceanographic  vessel in support of 
              NSF-sponsored research projects.  The  R/V LONGHORN is a  103' research vessel
              constructed in 1971  and stretched to its  present length  in  1986.  The 
              vessel is  owned  and  operated  by  the  University of Texas and has a 1997
              operating schedule of 100  days of  which  6 are in support of NSF-sponsored
              programs.  The  ship will operate primarily in the Gulf of Mexico.          The
               LONGHORN  is  part of a fleet of  ships  used  by  the National  Science 
              Foundation to support marine  research.  Most oceanographic research requires
              highly  specialized equipment  and extensive support from the ship's  crew.  An
              increasing number of research projects require  equipment that must be
              permanently installed on a ship and  for which the ship must be specifically
              designed.   Such  equipment also requires highly trained crew members for 
              maintenance and operation.  These vessels do not operate  in  the same manner
              as general cargo or fishing  vessels. NSF  supports the operation of a variety
              of ships specifically  dedicated to oceanographic research.  These vessels are 
              operated by universities and institutions around the  country.
