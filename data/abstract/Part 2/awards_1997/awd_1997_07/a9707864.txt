Abstract    :
              9707864  Bevier      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty  four months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a six-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Catherine Robb Bevier to work with Dr.
              Carlos  Arturo Navas at the Universidade de Sao Paulo in Brazil.    This
              project involves field and laboratory studies of two  tropical and two
              subtropical Brazilian treefrogs, the  Hylids.  These frogs exhibit variation in
              calling effort,  habitat types along altitudinal and latitudinal clines, and 
              body temperatures during periods of activity, allowing the  study of their
              underlying physiological mechanisms from an  ecological and behavioral
              perspective.  Brazil offers a  unique and environmentally variable field site,
              along with  access to a population of closely related but behaviorally  and
              ecologically diverse frogs. Dr. Bevier brings her  research experience in the
              area of physiological and  biochemical correlates of behavioral performance in
              frogs,  while Dr. Navas is an expert in metabolic physiology.  The  results of
              their research will benefit scientists who have  an interest in animal
              adaptation to cold and exercise  physiology.  ***
