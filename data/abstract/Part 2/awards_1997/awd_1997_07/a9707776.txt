Abstract    :
                  9707776  OTTE  Katydids are one of the most conspicuous groups of insects
              world-wide. In the 200 years since Linnaeus, 1193 genera and 7188 species of
              Tettigoniidae (katydids) have been described.  Numerous new species are being
              described each year; many more species are deposited in museums and await
              description. A large number of species remain to be collected. But the
              underlying classification is outdated, inadequate, and often wrong.  Existing
              classifications of Tettigoniidae are based largely on 19th and early 20th
              century works. No cladistic methodology has been applied to studies on their
              relationships. Because the vast majority of world species remain to be
              discovered or described, it is appropriate now to improve the taxonomic
              framework and prepare for the future.  In this work by Daniel Otte and Piotr
              Naskrecki, a new katydid classification, based primarily on morphological
              characters of the insects and based on sound phylogenetic principles, will be
              produced. The results will be distributed both in traditional printed form and
              as an interactive, searchable catalog and phylogenetic tree available on the
              Internet and CD ROM.  This work will provide the first solid phylogenetic
              framework and a reference base for future research on Tettigoniidae.
