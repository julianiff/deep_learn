Abstract    :
              DMS-9707768      The Department of Statistics at the Carnegie Mellon University
              will  purchase computer equipment which will be dedicated to the support of
              research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used  for several
              research projects in mathematics, including in particular:    Exploratory
              analysisof massive data sets    Fault Diagnosis in VLSI Manufacture   
              Disclosure Avoidance and Intruder Modeling for Census-Like data    Comparative
              Analysis of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data Sets
