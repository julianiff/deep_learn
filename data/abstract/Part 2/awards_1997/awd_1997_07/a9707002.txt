Abstract    :
              9707002  Zhou     A highly sensitive technique for the atmospheric measurement
              of formaldehyde and oxygenated carbonyl compounds, including
              hydroxyacetaldehyde, hydroxyacetone, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and formaldehyde
              will be further developed and deployed in the field. Oxygenated carbonyl
              compounds are important products of the atmospheric oxidation of both biogenic
              and anthropogenic hydrocarbons. Because of their photolytic activities in the
              solar spectrum of the lower troposphere, these compounds become important
              precursors for atmospheric free radicals.    The measurement technique is based
              on aqueous scrubbing of the compounds of interest using a coil sampler followed
              by derivatization with DNPH and HPLC analysis. The detection limits will be on
              the order of 10-30ppt with a time resolution shorter than 20 minutes. The
              instrument will be deployed during a multi-investigator field campaign in 1998
              at Pinnacle State Park, NY, where a large variety of atmospheric trace species
              will be measured simultaneously as part of the NARSTO-Northeast program.
