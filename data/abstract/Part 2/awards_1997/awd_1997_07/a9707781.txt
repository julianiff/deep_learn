Abstract    :
              THOMPSON  DEB-9707781    Recent hypotheses on the coevolutionary process have
              suggested that ongoing coevolution between species may require networks of
              geographically interconnected populations.  A major component of the overall
              geographic mosaic theory of coevolution is that interactions between species
              evolve through interconnected coevolutionary hotspots (i.e., communities in
              which reciprocal evolution occurs between particular pairs of species) and
              coldspots (i.e., communities in which the interactions are not coevolving).
              This study will use the interaction between the moth Greya politella and its
              major hostplant Lithophragma parviflorum to provide a direct test of whether
              coevolutionary hotspots actually occur.  This work will use the observation
              that the Greya-Lithophragma interaction may vary from mutualism to commensalism
              to antagonism among communities as a way of determining how coevolutionary
              hotspots may be distributed geographically.    Critical tests of the geographic
              mosaic theory of coevolution are important for our applied use of ecological
              processes for three reasons. First, these studies will help evaluate whether
              biological priorities for conservation of species and the genetic richness they
              harbor need to take these geographic mosaics into account. Second, results of
              these studies will be useful in developing protocols for programs involving the
              geographic mixing or homogenization of populations, as occurs in species
              reintroduction programs and biological control programs. Finally, these studies
              will aid directly in the development of a broader landscape approach to the
              application of ecological processes and principles.
