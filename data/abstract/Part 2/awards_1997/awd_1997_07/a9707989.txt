Abstract    :
                What is the political impact of economic reform in contemporary Latin America?
               Have new, market-oriented, government policies triggered new patterns of
              political organization?  This research investigates the impact of three major
              policy reforms in contemporary Peru:  taxation, social security pension
              privatization and targeted poverty alleviation.  Each of these areas of public
              policy switched from state-centered to market-oriented mechanisms in the 1990s.
               Theoretical work in the field of public policy suggests that the political
              consequences of economic reform varies significantly across policy areas and is
              directly related to the distribution of costs and benefits to the public.  This
              research has three important implications for the study of market-oriented
              reforms.  First, it sheds light on the long-term viability of such reforms. 
              Second, it provides insight into the growth and maintenance of new interest
              groups.  Finally, this research enhances our general understanding of
              state-society interactions in Latin America.
