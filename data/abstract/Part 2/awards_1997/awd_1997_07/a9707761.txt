Abstract    :
              This research by a cultural anthropologist, psychologists and linguists explores
              biological categorization and reasoning about ecological relationships. The
              investigators will ask where and how differences in cultural belief systems and
              experience with nature affect folk-biological categorization and reasoning.
              Using elicitation techniques from anthropology and psychology involving
              prepared stimulus materials as well as open-ended discussions and observations
              of people's interactions with their natural environment, the investigators will
              seek to show how the perceptual and morphological organization of living kinds,
              which is apparent in the folk taxonomies of cultures the world over, is
              integrated with a more causal and relational understanding of biology. Native
              Maya and Spanish speaking residents of Peten, Guatemala will be studied. The
              extent to which local knowledge of plants and animals represents the structure
              of ecological communities will be a special focus of the study. The project
              builds on prior fieldwork and laboratory experiments, using methods including
              consensus analysis and computational models of categorization and reasoning. 
              This study is important because it will advance our understanding of how people
              categorize and reason about the living world, and will provide a cognitive
              baseline for understanding similarities and differences in the ways humans
              interact with nature.
