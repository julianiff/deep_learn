Abstract    :
                  Funds are requested for a high-resolution low-temperature  scanning electron
              microscope.  The instrument isan Hitachi  S5000 scanning electron microscope
              with cryosystem,  backscattered electron detector, digital image system, and 
              is matrixed for remote operation.  With low-temperature  microscopy the sample
              is held at liquid nitrogen temperature  during examination, allowing water to
              be preserved for  imaging in the frozen hydrated state and the surface and 
              interior of cells to be analyzed without the need for  chemical fixation,
              dehydration or drying.
