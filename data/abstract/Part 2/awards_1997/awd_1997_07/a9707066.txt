Abstract    :
              A symposium on performance-based engineering will be held in January 1997 in
              Berkeley.  This symposium will be used to honor the contributions of Professor
              Vitelmo Bertero to the field of earthquake engineering over his illustrious
              career.  Technical presentations on frontier research will be made on January
              31 and February l. The target audience for the  two-day technical program will
              focus on performance-based earthquake engineering and a design.  The symposium
              is split into four one-half day sessions.  The four session titles are:
              Reinforced Concrete Structures, Steel Structures, Design Methodologies, and
              Learning from Earthquakes.  The Symposium will bring together many experts in
              the field of earthquake engineering.  It     offers an outstanding opportunity
              for young faculty from around the United States to gain state-of-the-knowledge
              information on performance-based earthquake engineering, and to meet expert
              academicians, researchers and design professionals.  A unique feature of this
              meeting is to bring 20 young faculty and 5 speakers from around the United
              States to the Symposium.  This will afford young researchers a valuable
              opportunity to interact with  senior and accomplished researchers in technical
              discussions.
