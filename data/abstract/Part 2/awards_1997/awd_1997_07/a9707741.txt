Abstract    :
                This award provides continued support of the Foundation's long-term commitment
              for the National Election Studies (NES).  The National Science Foundation's
              Political Science Program supports the NES research program to sustain and
              enhance the diversified data base that undertakes basic research on voting,
              public opinion, and political participation in the United States.    The
              current award provides support for the 1998 Congressional elections and the
              2000 Presidential election.  The award provides for continuation of the core
              time-series data collection which has been supported in part by the NSF since
              1970 and completely since 1978.   The Board of Overseers will continue to
              function as a very real partner in study planning and will maintain its full
              role as trustee and representative of the larger community of users of the NES
              data.  There are opportunities for the diverse national social community to
              participate directly in the design and execution of NES studies.  There are
              resources for improving the quality of the core NES time-series data and for
              testing innovations in theory, measurement, and data collection.    This
              research constitutes the most important data base for the study of American
              politics and American political behavior.
