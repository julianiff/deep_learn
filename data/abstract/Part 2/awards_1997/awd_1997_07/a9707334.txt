Abstract    :
              9707334  Fashoro  This research focuses on the modeling of a pneumatic  actuator
              that has characteristics more similar to human  muscle than standard electric
              or hydraulic actuators. This  involves the development of non-linear adaptive
              joint motion  control strategies for an artificial elbow joint driven with 
              artificial muscle actuators arranged in antagonistic pairs.  There are two
              major tasks proposed for this research: (1)  the building of a one-link
              physical model and the derivation  of the dynamic equations for the fine motion
              of the elbow  joint, and (2) the incorporation of a non-linear  dynamic/static
              artificial muscle model into the dynamic  equations of the fine motion of the
              artificial elbow. This  device could have use in prostheses, orthotes, robot
              arms  and surgical hands.  ***
