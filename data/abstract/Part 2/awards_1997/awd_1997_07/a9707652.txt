Abstract    :
              9707652  Brown  This is a promising new investigator in the field of 
              biomaterials and tissue engineering.  She has great  potential to become a fine
              scientist.  Funding of this  proposal is expected to advance the PI's career
              and meet the  goals of this program.    The proposed research investigates
              novel polymers that swell  and collapse in response to electrical stimuli. 
              These  materials may be useful for modulated drug delivery.  The PI  has
              already constructed a prototype of the electrorelease  chamber used in these
              studies and has an appropriate  background to conduct the proposed studies.  In
              addition to  potential drug delivery applications, the proposed  technology may
              be useful for in vitro evaluation of cellular  responses to various substances.
                 As technical notes, LDH is a crude measure of cytotoxicity  and
              biocompatibility, as it detects rupture of cell  membranes.  Changes in insulin
              production, cell metabolism,  etc. will be observed long before membrane
              rupture.  Inclusion of a diagram of the electrorelease chamber would  have been
              helpful, in that the photograph provided was not  very clear.  ***
