Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at U.C. L.A.   will purchase computer equipment
              which will be dedicated to the support of research in the Mathematical
              Sciences.  The equipment will be used for several research projects, including
              in particular: Computation in Algebra, Computation in Algebraic Geometry, and
              Computation in Interacting Particle Systems.
