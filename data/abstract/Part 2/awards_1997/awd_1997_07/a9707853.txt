              Award Abstract      Fellow:   Manuel B. Sainz  Proposal number:  DBI  9707853   
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research  Fellowship for 1997.  
               This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of integrative
              plant biology and genetic mechanisms.  The  title of the research and training
              plan is "Identification  and characterization of genes required for plant
              disease  resistance."  The signal transduction pathway for plant  disease
              resistance links pathogen recognition to increased  expression of defense
              genes.  The goal of this research is  to isolate components linking the events
              of disease  resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana resistant to Pseudomonas 
              syringae mediated by the pathogen avrRpt2.  The disease  resistance response is
              being characterized in isolated  mutants and the novel genes involved are being
              cloned.
