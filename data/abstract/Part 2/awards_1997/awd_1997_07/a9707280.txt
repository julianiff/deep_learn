Abstract    :
              9707280  Barpy    This is a Career Advancement Award for Women Scientists and
              Engineers.  Dr. Barry has been studying the structure and function of the
              photosynthetic water oxidizing complex (photosystem II).  She has used a
              variety of techniques to achieve her research goals, including EPR and infrared
              spectroscopies.  She has developed procedures to purify photosystem II from
              plants and cyanobacteria.  In addition, she has been studying site directed
              mutants, generated in photosystem II from a cyanobacterium that can be grown
              photoheterotrophically.  Dr. Barry will take a sabbatical leave in order to
              master the techniques of molecular biology and genetics, and will subsequently
              implement these techniques in her own laboratory.    Photosystem II is present
              in plants, green algae, and prokaryotic cyanobacteria.  The complex oxidizes
              water to oxygen.  An understanding of the mechanism by which this occurs
              requires a combination of techniques, providing information about the
              structures of the redox active tyrosines in photosystem II, as well as
              information about the structural changes that occur at the manganese containing
              active site.  Site directed mutagenesis can be used to assign spectral features
              to a particular residue in the enzyme.  Ultimately, this combination of
              techniques provides new insight into the structure and function of photosystem
              II.  ***
