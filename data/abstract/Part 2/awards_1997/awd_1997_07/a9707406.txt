Abstract    :
              9707406  Brown  This project will continue the experimental studies in the
              Chihuahuan Desert near Portal, Arizona. The 20-ha study site contains 24 fenced
              plots, each 0.25 ha in area. The investigators have maintained the removal of
              some or all species of rodents and/or ants from 10 plots continuously since
              1977 and from an additional 10 plots since 1988. Standardized censuses of
              rodents, ants, and plants provide invaluable data on responses of individuals,
              populations, and communities both to experimental perturbations and to
              background temporal and spatial variation in the environment. Results to date
              demonstrate: 1) reorganization of the entire ecosystem, including large
              increases in woody vegetation and extinction, colonizations, or shifts in
              abundance of many animal species, apparently caused by a change in climate
              since the late 1970's; 2) complex seasonal and interannual dynamics of rodent,
              ant, and plant populations; 3) direct effects of seed predation by rodents,
              birds, and ants which substantially alter species composition of winter annual
              plants but leave overall population density and species diversity unchanged; 4)
              direct effects of competition by kangaroo rats on population densities and
              species diversity of other seed-eating rodent species; and 5) indirect effects
              of kangaroo rats on vegetation (summer active grasses), other rodents, birds,
              and lizards. This project will continue the experimental manipulations and
              standardized censuses of rodents, ants, and plants. In addition, the
              investigators will: 1) analyze the relationship between local abundance,
              spatial distribution, and temporal distribution of annual and woody plants,
              rodents, and ants; 2) investigate the relationships between species composition
              and ecosystem processes; and 3) assess the interacting influences of climate,
              livestock grazing, and fire on the transition between desert shrubland and arid
              grassland.
