              and the  First Southeast Asian Dendroecological Fieldweek; February 1998 in 
              Chiang Mia, Thailand    Monsoon and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
              variability impact  much of Southeast Asia and the globe.  High-resolution 
              paleoclimatic records, including tree-ring data, can yield  information about
              past behavior of climate in Southeast Asia prior  to the period of instrumental
              record.  However, few tree-ring  chronologies have been produced to date.  To
              foster development of  such records, identify critical research questions, and
              initiate  collaborations among interested scientists, this award will support 
              a workshop on Southeast Asian dendrochronology to be held in  February, 1998,
              in Chiang Mai, Thailand.  It will be immediately  followed by the first
              Southeast Asian Dendroecological Fieldweek,  which will allow scientists to
              learn techniques and initiate  projects in collaboration with others involved
              in tree-ring studies  in the region.
