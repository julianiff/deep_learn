Abstract    :
              9707428  Reeder     The scincid lizards of the Sphenomorphus group include at
              least 210 recognized species and represent a dominant component of the
              Australian herpetological (amphibian and reptile) fauna.  These lizards are
              characterized by extensive variation in reduction of limbs: eight of the
              fourteen described genera contain species that exhibit limb reduction, ranging
              from loss of a single phalange (a bony element in a finger or toe) to complete
              limblessness.  Tod Reeder of the University of San Diego will employ DNA
              sequences from the mitochondrially-encoded 12S and 16S ribosomal (r)RNA genes
              to assess genealogical relationships among over 70 Sphenomorphus species and
              allies.  He also will examine a suite of morphological characters, derived
              primarily from osteological structures and scales.  These data will be used to
              generate a genealogy of the species, in part to generate a natural
              classification.  The patterns of limb reduction in these species will be
              assessed from within the context of the genealogy in order to determine the
              number of times and trajectories of limb reduction and to determine the
              life-history traits associated with these morphological changes.  Relative
              rates of limb reduction between fore- and hind-limbs also will be assessed. 
              Results from this project will improve understanding of lizard phylogeny,
              provide empirical information on the utility of reductive characters in lizard
              phylogeny and biology, and contribute a necessary framework for the
              investigation of other biological and ecological attributes.
