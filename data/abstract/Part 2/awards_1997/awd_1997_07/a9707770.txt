Abstract    :
              9707770  Wolf    The Department of Mathematics at Rice University will purchase
              2 compute servers, 6 workstations, a laser printer, a 9.1 Gbyte hard disk, and
              backup software.  This equipment will be dedicated to the support of research
              in the mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used in several research
              projects, including Knot Theory and 3 Manifold Topology by Tim Cochran,
              Differential Geometry by Robert Hardt and Michael Wolf, 3-manifold topology by
              John Hempel, and Wavelet Analysis by R.O. Wells.    The projects require both
              numerical and symbolic computing, and depend heavily on the graphical display
              of data.
