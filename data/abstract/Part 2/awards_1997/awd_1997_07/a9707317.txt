Abstract    :
              This research is on automating the extraction of behavioral models from natural 
              language descriptions of digital systems such as specifications, proposals and 
              U.S. patents. The behavioral models are necessary for simulation in new system 
              design and test generation on legacy system replacement. Often, only the
              natural  language descriptions are available. An information extraction
              approach is being  taken to develop an interactive system to help the modeler.
              The system will scan  source documents, perform syntactic and semantic analysis
              to identify behavioral  elements (actions, states, events) and their
              relationships, and instantiate  conceptual templates from which augmented
              control dataflow graph models may be  generated. A central research issue is
              the correct selection and filling of  behavioral templates. Performance of the
              system is being evaluated on how much  of the behavioral information is
              discovered automatically and how accurately the  information is inserted into
              the templates.
