Abstract    :
                  Abstract  Schumaker    This proposal is to support the ninth international
              conference on Approximation Theory and Related Topics in Nashville, January
              3-6.  These meeting have been the main general international conferences on
              approximation theory for the last 25 years.  The objective of the conference is
              to provide a triennial forum for researchers in the field to discuss current
              work.  It also will provide a forum for the awarding of the Second Vasil A.
              Popov Prize in Approximation Theory.  There meeting will feature 7 one-hour
              survey lectures in addition to the one-hour lecture by the winner of the Popov
              Prize.     Approximation is the defining feature of mathematical analysis. 
              Compact expressions of solutions of problems arising in the physical universe
              rarely occur.  More often, the solutions must be approximated by known
              quantities which have desirable properties and are easily computed.  This
              research contributes to the dual goals of understanding the special functions
              of analysis and discovering their approximation properties.
