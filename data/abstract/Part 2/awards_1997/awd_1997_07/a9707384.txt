Abstract    :
              Bedinger  9707384    The long term objective of the research in my laboratory is
              to understand molecular events in the reproduction of higher plants, including
              gametogenesis and pollination. The study of pollen-specific gene products,
              including the Pex (Pollen-extensin) proteins, has been the focus of a major
              effort. Although we have performed molecular and localization studies on these
              proteins that strongly suggest that they play an important role in pollination,
              we lack the genetic data that firmly establishes that the Pex proteins are
              essential for pollen function. One way to obtain this data is through the use
              of antisense-expressing transgenic plants. We have cloned both maize and tomato
              versions of the Pex genes. This proposal is to fund visits to two laboratories
              to learn how to transform tomato (and tomato pollen) and maize, and to analyze
              the transgenic plants that are produced. Our assays for pollen function
              encompass genetic transmission of mutant genotypes, pollen structure, pollen
              tube germination and structure, and pollen-pistil interactions.
