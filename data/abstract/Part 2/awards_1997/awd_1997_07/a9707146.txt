Abstract    :
              9707146  MCHUGH    The symposium ORelationships of Metazoan Phyla: Advances,
              Problems, and ApproachesO, to be coordinated by Damhnait McHugh and Kenneth M.
              Halanych, will be hosted by the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology
              in Boston in January, 1998.  This symposium will provide a critical assessment
              of the current state of knowledge about the historical (phylogenetic)
              relationships among the phyla of animals, especially those that have different
              body plans.  By identifying problems and highlighting different approaches to
              reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships among animal groups, the
              symposium will play an important role in directing future research in the
              field.  The two-day schedule includes three keynote addresses and 17 symposium
              presentations from researchers on topics such as the use of mitochondrial gene
              arrangements to analyze relationships among animals, the genetic basis for
              change in animal body plans, the phylogenetic relationships among bilaterally
              symmetrical animals as assessed by both morphological and molecular evidence,
              and the possibility that the great increase in the numbers of animal taxa
              observed in Cambrian-age fossils relative to those in older rocks does not mean
              that there were fewer animal species before the Cambrian.  Symposium
              proceedings will be published in the journal OAmerican ZoologistO.
