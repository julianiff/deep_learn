Abstract    :
              BELOVSKY  9707564    The control of herbivore populations is a hotly debated
              issue among ecologists.  The PI has been studying the relative importance of
              weather, food, predators, and history on the regulation of replicated
              populations of grasshoppers in a grassland ecosystem.  This proposal is a
              renewal of a research project that has continued uninterrupted since 1992.  The
              PI has constructed a general model of population dynamics based on the manner
              that density affects population processes such as reproduction, probability of
              predation, and survival.  The model employs recruitment curves which relate
              current population levels to the previous generation.  This renewal will
              continue the experiments began four years ago to further test the PI's initial
              results that shifts in population dynamics over space and time are predictable.
                 The control of insect herbivores is of paramount interest in an economy
              emphasizing crop and timber production.  This project takes a novel approach in
              combining density-dependent and independent factors with historical factors to
              further our understanding of how insect populations are regulated.
