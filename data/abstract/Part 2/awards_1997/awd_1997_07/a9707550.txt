Abstract    :
              9707550  He    This is a Research Planning Grant for Women Scientists and
              Engineers.  Dr. He will develop diffusion or mobility ordered homonuclear
              coherence correlated NMR spectroscopy.  A dimension of electrophoretic mobility
              or diffusion will be introduced to the homonuclear correlated spectroscopy
              (COSY) by applying a pulsed electric field and magnetic field gradients. In a
              dimension of electrophoretic flow of diffusion, COSY spectra of different
              proteins will be sorted according to their electrophoretic mobilities or
              diffusion rates.  Hence, the traditional COSY spectra of the proteins will be
              separated and their interactions studied.    The technique being developed here
              will provide new information for studying folding processes and protein
              interactions during molecular signaling processes, during DNA transcription, or
              during normal and abnormal cell growth.  ***
