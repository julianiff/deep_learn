Abstract    :
              The goal of this Research Planning Grant (RPG) is to examine the temporal
              pattern of endogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release in the
              bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana. Ranid flogs are highly unique in that they are the
              only tetrapods known to date to display a true physiological preference for
              continuous, rather than pulsatile, GnRH input for the maintenance of
              gonadotropin secretion. Based on this observation, it is hypothesized that
              unlike mammals and birds, reproduction in ranid frogs is driven by continuous
              release of endogenous GnRH.    This hypothesis will be tested directly in this
              Research Planning Grant by investigating the temporal pattern of GnRH release
              from bullfrog hypothalamic slices using an in vitro perfusion system. The RPG
              results will provide the physiological basis for future investigations into the
              mechanisms by which continuous GnRH stimulation supports the overall
              reproductive functions. In addition, these data will facilitate the
              understanding of the dynamics of a potentially very novel
              hypothalamic-pituitary system.
