Abstract    :
              9707145  Naylor     Galeomorph sharks are the most taxonomically-diverse and
              dominant group of living sharks, and include many of the large and well known
              species such as the great white, tiger, hammerhead, and whale sharks.  The
              galeomorphs have an extensive fossil record that extends to the Jurassic,
              demonstrating that sharks represent an early offshoot in the vertebrate
              genealogical tree.  In this research, Gavin Naylor of Iowa State University
              will employ DNA sequences acquired from both the mitochondrial and nuclear
              genomes to study phylogenetic relationships among well over 100 species of
              sharks, including representatives of seven different orders.  Naylor will test
              whether each of the four orders of galeomorph sharks were derived from a common
              ancestor, and also will examine relationships among species in several lineages
              within each galeomorph order.  The phylogenetic hypothesis will be used (i) in
              conjunction with the rich galeomorph fossil record to assess the time or origin
              of many morphological adaptations unique to sharks, and (ii) as a framework for
              interpreting the rich, existing database on shark parasite diversity.  Naylor
              also will investigate the extent to which DNA sequence form different genes and
              from different regions of the same gene converge on the same genealogical tree.
               This analysis will provide information as to how DNA changes over time and how
              estimation of genealogical trees from DNA sequence data can be improved.
