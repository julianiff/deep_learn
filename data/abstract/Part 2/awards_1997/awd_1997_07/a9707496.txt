Abstract    :
                    9707496  Zink  Robert Zink and Sievert Rohwer of the University of
              Minnesota and the University of Washington, respectively, will carry out a
              study of the geographic divergence of mitochondrial DNA from a variety of
              widespread, Eurasian species of birds.  Their goal is to determine whether
              common patterns of genetic variation and divergence within each species across
              Eurasia can be documented.  Comparisons of DNA sequences within and among
              populations reveal whether species are genetically homogeneous across their
              ranges or whether they have responded via natural selection or genetic drift to
              isolating barriers, such as mountain ranges or glaciers that isolated ancestral
              populations.  Previous studies by these scientists among New World avifaunas
              have revealed a mixture of population structures, although characteristically,
              relatively little divergence is observed in regions that were glaciated.  Very
              little is known about this topic in Eurasia, and Zink and Rohwer predict that
              far more evident patterns will be apparent among Eurasian groups because of
              less severe impacts of the glaciers.  Their comparisons of genetic patterns
              between North American and Eurasian species will permit an assessment of
              genetic responses to environmental events common to temperate, recently
              glaciated continental landscapes.  The project also will afford a unique
              collaboration with scientists from Russia.
