Abstract    :
              1.  AWARDEE STATEMENT OF WORK    a.  Loyola College shall be wholly responsible
              for the management   and operation of the International Technology Research
              Institute (ITRI), which operates the World Technology Evaluation Center (WTEC).
               ITRI will plan, organize, conduct, and manage technology assessments, using
              the methodology and procedures described in proposal ENG-9707092, dated
              December 9, 1996, submitted by Loyola College to NSF.    b.  The mission of
              WTEC is to provide U.S. government, industry,   and academia with technical
              studies of the best research and development abroad.  In addition to conducting
              new studies under this cooperative agreement, center operations will provide
              information to the public concerning past studies, World Wide Web service of
              studies concluded under previous grants and agreements with NSF, and liaison
              with parties interested in transferring technology gained since the
              establishment of the centers at Loyola.    c.  WTEC will conduct up to 16
              studies to benchmark technologies   in foreign counties.  The studies will be
              divided among three types that differ in the breadth of their objectives, the
              extensiveness of the final report, and the methodologies for selecting the
              targeted technology and an expert panel.  The proposal forecasts six standard
              studies, five mission-directed (agency) studies, and five CISAR studies.  The
              actual blend of studies will be determined by the interest of NSF and the
              sponsoring agencies, and may differ to the extent that funding resources
              permit.
