Abstract    :
               This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student at
              the Pennsylvania State University.  The project involves changes in gender
              roles within the family as a result of international migration.  The student
              will investigate traditional gender roles in a rural community in Bangladesh,
              and also among a sample of Bangladeshi immigrants in New York City.  The
              student will test hypotheses concerning traditional gender roles, social
              networks and their change in the new urban environment.  Families with larger
              Bangladeshi social networks, and with adult women with no formal employment
              will be expected to maintain more traditional gender roles.  The student will
              draw a random sample of families in New York and in a source community in
              Bangladesh, and will administer a formal measure of gender roles as well as do
              participant observation at public events and private household contexts.   
              This research is important because modern means of transportation and
              communications facilitate rapid population movements between different
              societies.  Advances in our understanding of the effects of migration on basic
              relationships in the family will help policy makers and planners cope with
              problems rising from a mismatch between traditional and contemporary forms of
              gender relations.
