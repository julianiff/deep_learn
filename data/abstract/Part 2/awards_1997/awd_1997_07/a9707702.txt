Abstract    :
                9707702  Verona    The Maryland Virtual High School Core Models Project will
              guide Maryland secondary science and mathematics teachers in implementing
              computational science and modeling activities in their classrooms to support
              systemic mathematics and science reform efforts as specified in the Maryland
              Core Goal. The CoreModels Project will identify and adapt modeling materials
              consistent with the Core Goals, establish three regional centers to support the
              implementation of the activities, and work with the Maryland State Department
              of Education to measure the effectiveness of computational activities in
              helping students achieve these objectives. Each regional center will be
              directed and supported by teachers who are experienced in using computational
              modeling in the classroom and in leading inservice efforts.  ***
