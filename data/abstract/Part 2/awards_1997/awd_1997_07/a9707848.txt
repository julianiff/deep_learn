              Award Abstract      Fellow:   Felipe N. Soto-Adames  Proposal number:  DBI
              9707848    This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research  Fellowship
              for 1997.    This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of
              systematic biology.  The research and training plan is  entitled " Molecular
              markers and patterns of speciation in  soil inhabiting microarthropods."  The
              organisms being  studied comprise the Lepidocyrtus-Pseudosinella genera 
              complex (Hexapoda: Collembola) in greater Puerto Rico.  Collembola are the most
              diverse of the primitive, wingless  hexapods and important to soil biology. 
              Diversity and  patterns of speciation are being determined with the use of 
              molecular tools and geographical distribution to gain  insight into the factors
              contributing to the evolutionary  success of this important and under-studied
              group of  organisms.
