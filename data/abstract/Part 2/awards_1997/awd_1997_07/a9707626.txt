Abstract    :
                  This project is designed to study the evolutionary history of Arctic Brown
              Bears (Ursus arctos) in Southeast Alaska as means of understanding the general
              biogeography of arctic vertebrates.  The PI proposes to construct nuclear
              phylogenies from 1) introns of two aldolase genes, and intron of a histone gene
              and an exon from the major-histocompatibility-complex, DQa gene; and 2) the
              sex-determining region (Sry) and the last intron of the zinc-finger locus (ZFY)
              on the Y chromosome.  These loci do not recombine yet have a high rate of
              interspecific variation, and thus provide a nuclear paternal analog to the
              cytoplasmic, maternally inherited system previously described by the PI.  If
              nuclear DNA diversity between polar bears and brown bears exceeds diversity of
              mtDNAs of brown bears alone, mtDNA paraphyly via hybridization would be
              indicated.  If nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies are congruent, paraphyly
              via emergence from a common ancestor would be indicated.  The results of this
              research will indicate the relative roles of geographic isolation,
              biogeographic patterns, and philopatry in the development of endemic taxa.
