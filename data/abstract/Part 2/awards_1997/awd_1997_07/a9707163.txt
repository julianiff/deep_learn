Abstract    :
              The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Art Rodriguez of   East
              Carolina University and Ned H. Martin of The University of North   Carolina at
              Wilmington in their ongoing measurements of spin-lattice   relaxation rates as
              a function of temperature and field strength, in   various organic solvents. 
              Their goals are (i) to determine the magnitude   of the chemical shift
              anisotropy (CSA) and spin rotation (SR)   contributions to the spin-lattice
              relaxation rate of   buckminsterfullerene(C60) in various solvents; (ii) to
              determine the   relative importance of solute-solvent interactions and solvent
              free   volume on the magnitude of the CSA and SR contributions; (iii) to model 
               C60 in the various solvents; and (iv) to extend these studies to C70.   
              Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation measurements are one of the   most
              powerful techniques for investigating a variety of condensed phase   phenomena.
               The discovery of buckminsterfullerene and other related   fullerenes has
              generated a great deal of interest into the study of its   chemical as well as
              its physical properties.  While a number of   researchers have focused on
              investigating the solid state NMR properties   of this molecule, very few
              details are known concerning the condensed   phase carbon-13 spin-lattice
              relaxation rate and factors affecting this   mode of relaxation.
