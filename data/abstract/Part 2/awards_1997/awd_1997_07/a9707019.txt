Abstract    :
              9707019  Pinsky   This award provides funds to partially support the Midwest
              Probability   Colloquium. This meeting is held annually at Northwestern
              University during the month of   October. The Principal Speaker gives a series
              of two connected lectures, while two Hour   Speakers give one talk each. The
              colloquium serves also as a regular meeting ground for   75-100 probabilists
              from the greater midwest area, and allows graduate students and other   young
              investigators a chance to interact scientifically with specialists of similar
              interests.
