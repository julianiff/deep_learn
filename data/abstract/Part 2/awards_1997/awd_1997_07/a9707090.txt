Abstract    :
              ***  This  award,  in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research  mode,  will  
              investigate  ways  to  group  images  to  facilitate   the  development of
              effective indexing methods for image search.  Most  current  approaches to this
              problem focus on  texture  and  color  characteristics  in the images.  This
              effort, building  on  prior  funded  research  in  this  laboratory  on 
              nonparametric   shape  modeling, seeks to determine whether structural encoding
               can  be  used  more effectively to give the search engine more information 
              about  the  image, and thereby facilitate the search.  Generally,  contemporary
               approaches have avoided relying on such  structural  information  as  too
              difficult to obtain.  The  planned  approach  will  combine geometrical and
              topological considerations such  as  symmetry,   parallelness,  orthogonality, 
              and  connectivity   to  gainmore of an understanding of the image content,
              leading to the  production  of  digital  geometric primitives  to  aid  in 
              image  search.   These geometric/topologic primitives should  complement  the 
              texture  and  color  information  currently  used  for  this  purpose.***
