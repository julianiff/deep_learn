Abstract    :
              9707382  Raghavan    This work focuses on one of the major players of the
              cellular antigen processing machinery, the transporters associated with antigen
              processing (TAP).  The TAP proteins are members of the ATP binding cassette
              (ABC) family of transmembrane transporters.  The long term goal of this
              research is to gain insight into the mechanisms involved in substrate transport
              by ABC transporters.  The TAP proteins will be investigated as the prototype
              transporter.  Recombinant TAP proteins will be purified from insect cell
              membranes and reconstituted into artificial membranes to measure transport
              activities under strictly controlled conditions.  The coupling  between peptide
              and nucleotide binding by TAP will also be studied.  Finally, soluble TAP
              fragments will be obtained for structural studies.    A family of proteins
              called ABC transporters use the energy from ATP to transport various substances
              across cell membranes. This project uses biochemical and biophysical studies to
              understand the mechanism by which these transporters function.
