              Award Abstract      Fellow: Juan Carlos Jorge-Rivera  Proposal number:  DBI
              9707826    This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research  Fellowship
              for 1997.    This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of
              neuroendocrinology.  The research and training plan is  entitled "Functional
              role of a neurotransmitter system in  sex-specific reproductive behaviors." 
              Differences in  neuronal organization and function in the brains of males  and
              females provide the basis for sexually dimorphic  behaviors.  Benzodiazepine
              modulation of GABA-mediated  currents are being determined in sexually
              dimorphic regions  of the rat brain.  The impacts of these currents on sex- 
              specific reproductive behaviors mediated by these brain  regions are also being
              studied.
