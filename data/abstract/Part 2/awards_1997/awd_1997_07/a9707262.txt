Abstract    :
              9707262  FAWLEY    The class of green algae called the Prasinophyceae includes
              organisms similar to the ancestors of all green plants.  Some Prasinophyceae
              are flagellates, but others are nonflagellate (coccoid) unicells.  Some unusual
              pigments and cellular features that are distinct from land plants and other
              green algae occur in prasinophytes.  However, several studies have revealed
              that the Prasinophyceae is not a OnaturalO class, but may instead be composed
              of several different evolutionary lines.  Variations in cell structure and
              pigment composition that are shared among particular species of prasinophyte
              algae may indicate the presence of lineages that share a single common
              ancestor.    In thsi research, Marvin Fawley will focus on a particular group
              of prasinophytes, those that possess the carotenoid prasinoxanthin.  Several
              lines of evidence suggest that these organisms are from a single evolutionary
              lineage.  However, current classification systems place the prasinoxanthin
              possessing organisms in two separate orders.  This project will test the
              hypothesis that the prasinoxanthin possessing algae form a single lineage.  18S
              ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis as well as pigment and biochemical data
              will be  used.  Most of the organisms examined will be coccoid prasinophytes,
              because few of these organisms have been well studied.  However, the coccoid
              prasinophytes are critical to our understanding of the diversity of oceanic
              phytoplankton.  Better knowledge of the phylogeny of these organisms will
              contribute greatly to ongoing research on this diversity, as well as to our
              understanding of green plant evolution.
