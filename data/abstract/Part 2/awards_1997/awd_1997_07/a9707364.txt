Abstract    :
              INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BAYESIAN MODELINE: ISBA-1997    The funds from this
              group travel grant are to enable,   coordinate, and support U. S. participation
              in the   Fifth World Meeting of the International Bayesian Analysis   (ISBA)
              which will be held in Istanbul, Turkey during August   16-18, 1997. This
              meeting will be a satellite meeting for the   51st Session of the International
              Statistical Institute (ISI) in   Istanbul, Turkey during August 18-27, 1997.
              This meeting is   planned around the theme of linking Bayesian statistics to
              other   fields of science to stimulate cross-fertilization of theoretical,  
              methodological and computational research directions to meet   our societal
              needs by focusing attention to the arena of applied   problems in
              cross-disciplinary areas such as in computer science,   in engineering, in
              econometrics, finance, forensic and medical   sciences.     A primary goal of
              these funds is to present opportunities   for young researchers, international
              researchers, and   underrepresented groups, such as women and ethnic minorities
              and   persons with disabilities and graduate students an opportunity to  
              interact, to share, and to disseminate their research and   expertise with
              other researchers in many cross-disciplinary fields   in the international
              arena. Experts from several Western and Eastern   European countries,
              Australia, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom,   Middle East, Russia,
              Independent States of the former Soviet Union,   India, Africa, and the United
              States are expected to attend.
