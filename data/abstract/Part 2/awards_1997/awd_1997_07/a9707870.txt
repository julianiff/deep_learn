Abstract    :
              The foci of this research are two fold.  First, synthesis will be used to  
              prepare  examples of small molecule receptors that precedent suggests   will be
              selective peptide binders and then screening them for binding   with
              combinatorial libraries of ca. ten thousand different tri- or   hexapeptides. 
              Receptor designs that show high sequence selectivity will   then be used as the
              basis of libraries of receptors. Second, new   simulation methodology will be
              developed to deal with the sampling   problem involved in averaging the
              populated states of a complex molecular   system, in particular, a molecular
              system having many distinct, low   energy forms or conformers.  The methods
              developed will be used to   predict relative binding free energies of different
              substrates for a   given receptor. With this renewal award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular   Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. W. Clark
              Still of the   Department of Chemistry at Columbia University.  Dr. Still will
              focus his   work on the design and preparation of synthetic, small molecule
              receptors   for complex biological and chemical substrates.  Such small
              molecule   receptors have potential value both in understanding the basis of  
              molecular recognition and in practical applications involving chemical  
              sensing, chemical separations and catalysis. The research employs two  
              different approaches: one experimental that uses combinatorial methods in  
              receptor design and one theoretical that involves calculations of free  
              energies.
