Abstract    :
              Christine E. Evans is supported by the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry  
              Program to study the effects of pressure as a variable on the binding  
              constants of beta-cyclodextrin complexes and to determine the effects of  
              pressure on chromatographic retention and selectivity of such complexes.   
              Such host-guest interactions form the basis for liquid chromatographic   and
              electrophoretic separations of difficult positional isomers and   enantiometric
              species.  Liquid chromatographic, nuclear magnetic   resonance, and
              fluorescence measurements will be used to examine the   pressure effects. 
              Capillary electrophoresis at high pressure will be   explored and also used in
              the measurement of the pressure dependence of   these complexation reactions. 
              This work explores the use of pressure as a variable in the chemistry and  
              separation of complexes involving beta-cyclodextrin.  A better   understanding
              of the solution chemistry of these complexes and improved   methods for their
              separation has the potential to impact positively on   the preparation of pure
              pharmaceuticals and other compounds which are   needed in a high state of
              chemical purity and structure sameness.
