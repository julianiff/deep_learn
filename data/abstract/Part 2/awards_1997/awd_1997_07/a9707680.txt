Abstract    :
              9707680  McLendon  The aims of this research are to examine structure function
              relationships in the protein cytochrome C1.  Genetic and molecular biological
              procedures will be used to systematically alter cytochrome c1 (Cc1) in the
              yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Cc1 mutants will be generated by three
              procedures:  conventional oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, transformation
              of yeast directly  with synthetic oligonucleotides, and PCR-generated random
              mutagenesis.  The Cc1 mutants will be tested for functionality by growth on
              nonfermentable media (Nfs+ or Nfs-) , Cc1 levels by spectral analysis, and
              preservation of the over-all structure of Nfs- mutants by dominate-negative
              genetic analysis.  The altered forms will be used to investigate
              structure-function relationships of Cc1 and the interactions between Cc1 and
              cytochrome c (Cc), both in vivo and in vitro.  The sites of interaction between
              Cc1 and Cc, as well as between the cytochromes and Qcr6p, will be investigated
              with genetic approaches using suppressor mutations.  Reactivity in vitro will
              be studied by steady state and single turnover methods, including highly
              exergonic (G( reactions using photoinduced electron transfer from Cc.    The
              objective of this research is to examine structure function relationships in
              the protein cytochrome c1 (Cc1).  This protein plays a critical role in
              mitochodrial electron transport, and thereby helps control energy production
              within cells.  This research will probe factors which influence the redox
              potentials of Cc1, and thereby affect both thermodynamic and kinetic reactivity
              of this system.  The work will employ genetic, molecular biological and
              biophysical procedures.  ***
