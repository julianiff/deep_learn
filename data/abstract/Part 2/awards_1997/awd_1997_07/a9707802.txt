Abstract    :
              9707802  McFadyen  This activity focuses on providing opportunities for senior 
              engineering students in Biological Engineering to design and  construct devices
              and aids for students with disabilities at  the university.  These design
              projects will be incorporated  into the senior design course sequence, which
              all students  in Biological Engineering are required to take.  The design 
              projects will be developed to meet explicit needs that will  be identified each
              semester for persons with disabilities.  This activity would involve ten
              projects per year for a  period of five years.  Examples of projects to be 
              implemented during the first year include:  (1) a footmouse,  a device to allow
              operation of a computer more efficiently  for individuals with some nerve
              related disabilities which  have difficulty operating a standard computer
              mouse, (2) a  device to enable wheelchair users with cognitive impairments  to
              improve their ability to control the movement of a power  wheelchair, (3) an
              automated wheelchair guidance and  tracking system to control the movement of a
              power  wheelchair within a confined environment, (4) a wireless  telephone
              handset to allow a wheelchair user to move freely  about a room while talking
              on a telephone, and (5) a low  cost scientific calculator with voice output to
              aid visually  impaired individuals.  ***
