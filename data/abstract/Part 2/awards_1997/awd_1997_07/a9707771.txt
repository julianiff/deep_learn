Abstract    :
              9707771  Hamilton    This project develops new tests of whether an economic
              relation his nonlinear and a new method for choosing a particular nonlinear
              specification to use to describe the data.  The idea is to view the underlying
              relation as the outcome of a latent Brownian field.  The population parameters
              of this latent field are estimated by maximum likelihood.  Once its probability
              law has been specified, optimal inferences about the underlying relation can be
              obtained.  Potential economic applications include arriving at a better
              statistical description and understanding of business cycles, modeling the
              effects of oil shocks, analyzing how monetary policy affects the economy, and
              studying the convergence of income levels across different countries.
