Abstract    :
              The Divison of Statistics at Northern Illinois University will purchase
              computing equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research in
              statistics. The equipment will be used for several research projects, including
              in particular:     1. Additive models and data mining    2. Bayesian modles in
              reliability.    3. Small sample performance of models with dependent binary
              data.    4. Bayesian model selection for stochastic volatility.    5.
              Performance of bootstrap confidence intervals.
