Abstract    :
              9707108   Trotter  This is an RPG project which will give the PI an opportunity
              to develop a research project on diacylglycerol transport using a genetic
              approach in yeast.  DAG is an essential intermediate in lipid metabolism and is
              involved in cell signaling.  DAG moves between various membranes in the cell,
              but the mechanisms that mediate the movement are not known.  A mutant screen
              will be developed using a fluorescent DAG derivative to find mutants in the
              transport process.  Eventually, the genes involved can be identified and
              studied.  %%%  This is a Research Planning Grant project that will explore the
              development of methods for identifying yeast mutants that are defective in
              lipid transport between membranes.  These compounds are important for membrane
              function and cell signaling.  This work may provide new information about how
              synthesis is coordinated and regulated.  ***
