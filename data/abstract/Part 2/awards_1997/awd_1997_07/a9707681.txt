Abstract    :
                Phonological Form, Morphological Class, and Syntactic Gender: The Noun Class
              Systems of Papua New Guinea Arapesh.  This research will add to the
              understanding of linguistic clasification by collecting and analyzing data on
              the Arapesh dialects spoken in Papua New Guinea. Arapesh nouns are assigned to
              genders (agreement classes) not according to their semantics, but rather
              according to their phonological form. Arapesh speech will be carefully recorded
              so that the phonological system may be analyzed, gender agreement will be
              documented, and the precise  basis of classification will be determined for
              each of the dialects. The proposed research will (1) document an extraordinary
              linguistic system that is currently being leveled under contact pressure, (2)
              contribute to linguistic typology by drawing attention to a new dimension of
              structure which is relevant to classification, and (3) challenge the
              fundamental assumption of  modern cognitive science that subdomains of
              knowledge are informationally encapsulated.
