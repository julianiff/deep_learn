Abstract    :
              The current explosion in multimedia applications and services has been primarily
               enabled by the significant recent advances in image and video compression 
              technology, e.g., JPEG for still images and MPEG for video, which have become 
              household and marketing terms.  Digital HDTV is on the horizon, and will be
              based  on the MPEG-2 standard.  Does this mean that image/video coding has
              reached a  state of saturation where more research on compression is unlikely
              to yield  significant improvements?  This research tries to shed light on this
              by  investigating the fundamental performance bounds on image and video
              compression.   A primary goal is to uncover the performance gaps between
              existing commercial  systems and the theoretical performance optimally
              attainable, and to guide the  generation of improved compression algorithms in
              the future.    The main focus of this research is to derive fundamental
              rate--distortion bounds  for realistic classes of image and video models.  This
              enables the generation of  reliable estimates of the gap between the optimal
              performance theoretically  attainable for these models and that of specific
              coding algorithms based on them.   The analytical approach of this research
              contains the following key components:   (1) a hierarchy of increasingly
              complex and realistic image/video models; (2)  derivation of rate-distortion
              bounds for these models; (3) analysis of model  parameter identifiability and
              estimation accuracy; (4) compression based on  universal spectrum-blind
              spatio-temporal sampling techniques, and (5) model  validation on real
              images/video based on high-performance practical algorithms.
