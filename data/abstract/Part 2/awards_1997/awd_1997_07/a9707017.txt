Abstract    :
              Prof. Goodwin will continue his research on the study of catalytic mechanisms by
              means of the Steady Scope Isotopic Transient Kinetic Analysis (SSITKA)
              technique.  In this research he intends to extend the SSITKA technique to
              sequential reactions, particularly to the hydrogenation of CO into methanol and
              dimethyl ether on bifunctional catalysts, including Pd supported on silica,
              alumina, HY zeolite, silica-alumina, and silica-HY zeolite.  Surface
              concentration of reactive intermediates, specific site activity, site
              heterogeneity, readsorption of product, will be discriminated for each type of
              site, namely metallic and acidic sites.  Moment analysis, linear convolution,
              and deconvolution methods will be used to analyze the isotopic transient
              kinetic data obtained from the described reaction. The SSITKA program will be
              distributed freely.
