Abstract    :
              This comparison of solar variability with stellar analogs broadens the
              community's understanding of variability throughout the Sun's 11-year activity
              cycle.  Researchers have observed the potential for long-term brightness
              variability on 41 'sun-like' stars.  Their results show that changing visual
              brightness and magnetic activity are not simply correlated, as presumed in the
              reconstruction of long-term solar irradiance fluctuations from sunspot and
              other solar data.  This extension of stellar observations provides an unbroken
              set of precision photometric measurements, and enables comparisons of magnetic
              and brightness variations of the Sun with those of similar stars.  The research
              has direct impact on global change, as it provides estimates of the Sun's
              historic and future variations.
