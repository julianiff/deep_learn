Abstract    :
              This project will address the fundamental issues of robustness and adaptiveness
              in the identification of dynamic systems in both series-parallel and parallel
              formulations.  These two issues have been the topics of major concentrated
              research activities in system identification, control and filtering in the past
              20 years.  generally speaking, a system identifier  should be adaptive  to
              adaptation-worthy environmental parameters and robust to these which are
              adptative-unworthy.  Taking a synthetic approach inspired by the development of
              the artificial neural networks (ANNs) it will lay the mathematical foundations,
              develop the methodologies, and test their feasibility's for robust and/or
              adaptive identification  of dynamic systems in the project.  The main idea for
              adaptive identification  is to use the nonlinear and linear weights of an
              adaptive neural identifier as the long and short-term memory respectively, the
              former being determined  in a prior off-line training and the latter  adjusted
              on-line by an LMS or RLS algorithm.  Such an adaptive neural identifier is
              expected to have the advantages of minimizing  computation, focusing on
              learning about and adapting to the adaptation-worthy environmental parameters,
              and eliminating poor local extreme of the performance surface during the
              operation of the adaptive neural identifier.  This idea was inspired by the way
              a brain performs adaptation.
