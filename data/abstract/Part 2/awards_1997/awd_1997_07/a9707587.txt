Abstract    :
              Attardi  9707587         Career Advancement Awards expand the opportunity for 
              women researchers to advance their career.  Dr. Attardi will  use these funds
              to increase her knowledge of brain anatomy  and to acquire state-of-the-art
              neuroanatomical  techniques  to allow her to examine the differential actions
              of  progesterone leading to the facilitation or inhibition of  the gonadotropin
              surge.   The progesterone receptor is  unusual among members of the
              steroid/thyroid family of  nuclear receptors since, it exists in two isoforms,
              PRa and  PRb,  in all species except the rabbit.  Moreover, it has  been
              suggested that responsiveness to progesterone within a  particular tissue could
              depend upon changes in the relative  ratios of the two isoforms especially
              given that the two  isoforms change developmentally and with endocrine 
              manipulations.  Since these studies used only tissue from  the peripheral
              system, it is not clear whether the two  isoforms are involved in the mechanism
              of progesterone  action in neural tissue as well.   Dr. Attardi will now 
              examine both the presence and the regulation of the two  progesterone isoforms
              in the brain and pituitary.  She will  determine the role that these two 
              isoforms play in the  modulating the ability of estrogen and progesterone to 
              regulate gonadotropin secretion.  Understanding the  integration of this
              complex neuroendocrine mechanism is very  important since it underlies the
              perpetuation of the  species.
