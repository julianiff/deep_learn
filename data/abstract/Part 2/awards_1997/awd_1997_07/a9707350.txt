Abstract    :
              This proposal deals with the automated layout of mixed analog and digital 
              circuits. Optical interconnect interfaces which contain optoelectronic arrays 
              integrated with digital processing capability require layouts in which noise 
              sensitive analog circuits must be distributed throughout digital designs on a 
              regular pitch for alignment with guided or free-space optical inputs. New
              layout  tools must automatically incorporate application specific geometric
              constraints  and analog noise requirements to produce layouts for these
              emerging technologies.  The floor planning tool must have inputs from (1) a
              mask encapsulating the  optical interface positioning requirements, called a
              keyhole mask,(2) standard  cell and block compilers, and (3) the analog
              interfaces themselves. Problems  being investigated are (1) creating a keyhole
              mask(2) modifying the Berkeley  floor planning tool to provide feedback to the
              standard cell and block compilers  based on keyhole mask inputs, and(3)
              modifying the Berkeley standard cell  compiler to provide modified compilations
              based on inputs from the floor planning  tool.
