Abstract    :
              9707261  Shivaji  The Third Mississippi State Conference on DIFFERENTIAL
              EQUATIONS & COMPUTATIONAL SIMULATIONS will be held May 16 and 17, 1997 at
              Mississippi State University.  There are nine invited principle speakers. 
              These are:  Walter Allegretto, University of Alberta, Canada, Microsensor
              Analysis and Simulation  Jerry L. Bona,University of Texas, Stability and
              Instability of Solitary Waves and Associated Singularity Formation  Djairo de
              Figueiredo, University of Campinas, Brazil, Decay, Symmetry and Existence of
              Positive Solutions of Semilinear Elliptic Systems  S. Godunov, Sobolev
              Institute of Mathematics, Russia, Spectral Stratification in Models of Finite
              Elements for Elliptic Problems  Anthony Jameson, Princeton University, Title to
              be announced  Jean Mawhin, Universite de Louvain, Belgium, Floquet Boundary
              Value Problems for Nonlinear Differential Equations: A Blend of Topology and
              Symmetry     Stanley Osher, University of California, The Level Set Method:
              What's In It For You?  Klaus Schmitt, University of Utah, Bifurcation Problems
              for Variational Inequalities  Joseph Shang, Wright Patterson Air Force Base,
              High Resolution Schemes  for Computational Electromagnetics in the Time Domain 
              This interdisciplinary conference will provide a joint forum where
              mathematicians, scientists, and engineers from academia and industry can
              exchange research ideas involving theoretical and applied developments in
              differential equations and computational   simulations.  In addition to the
              nine principal lecturers, there will be sessions of contributed talks.  This
              conference is held bi-annually.  Reviewed manuscripts will be published as a
              special issue of the  Electronic Journal of Differential Equations. 
              Information on the conference is available on the conference home web page:
