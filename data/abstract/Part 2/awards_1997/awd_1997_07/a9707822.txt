Abstract    :
              9707822  JONES        Oregon  State University (OSU) will operate the R/V 
              WECOMA  during 1997 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of  NSF- 
              sponsored  projects.  The R/V WECOMA is a 185'  general  research  vessel 
              constructed  in 1975 and underwent a  mid-life  refit  in  1994.   OSU 
              operates the WECOMA under a charter  agreement  with  NSF.   The  ship is
              scheduled for 188 operating days in 1997,  of  which 107 days are in support of
              NSF-sponsored programs.  Of  the  remaining  81 days, 70 are in support of
              NOAA-supported  programs  and  11  are in support of Navy programs.  The WECOMA
              begins  the  year  with  cruises off the coast of northern California,  Oregon 
              and  Washington.  In mid-May the ship transit to the  Bering  Sea  for  a  70
              day NOAA cruise.  The remainder of the year's  cruises  will be in the pacific
              northwest.          This  vessel  is  part of a fleet used by  NSF  to  support
               oceanographic  research.   Most oceanographic  research  requires  highly 
              specialized equipment permanently installed on the vessel  for which the ship
              must be specifically designed.  This equipment  also  requires  highly trained
              crew members for  maintenance  and  operation.   Oceanographic vessels do not 
              operate  in  the  same  manner  as  general  cargo  or fishing  vessels, 
              therefore,  NSF  supports  the  operation  of  a  variety  of  ships 
              specifically  dedicated   to  oceanographic  research  that  are  operated   by
               universities and research institutions around the country.  ***
