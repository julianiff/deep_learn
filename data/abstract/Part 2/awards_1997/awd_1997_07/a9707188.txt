This research involves the seismological investigation of the
              crust and mantle beneath a transect extending from the Great Plains of western
              Texas through the Rio Grande rift and well into the Colorado Plateau.  By means
              of PASSCAL portable seismographs, scientists from four institutes (University
              of Texas at Austin, New Mexico State University, New Mexico Institute of Mining
              and Technology, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory) will occupy an 1100-km
              line for 10-12 months recording naturally occurring earthquakes.  Seismic
              body-wave (P and S) and surface-wave data will be collected to enable the
              construction of detailed two-dimensional maps of P and S velocities beneath
              this portion of the southwestern United States.  This mapping will be used to
              address questions such as the cause of the uplift of the Colorado Plateau, the
              depth of mantle processes that control surface tectonics, the connection
              between mantle and crustal strain beneath the Rio Grande Rift, and the location
              of the subducted Farallon plate.  Integration of surface geological information
              with the deep structure images will result in a more complete regional tectonic
              model and a better understanding of the causes of the dramatic tectonic events
              that have occurred during the last 40 million years in this region.
