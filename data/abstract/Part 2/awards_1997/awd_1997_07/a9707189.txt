Abstract    :
              9707189  Park    This research is a collaboration between Columbia University
              and  Yale University involving the investigation of different types of  mantle
              heterogeneity in the stable cratonic environment of the  northeastern U.S.  The
              strong heterogeneity in this geologically  old region is unexpected since
              lateral temperature gradients -  the main cause of heterogeneity in areas of
              active tectonics -  are probably very subdued.  Travel-time anomalies correlate
              with  shear-wave splitting variations, so at least some of the  heterogeneity
              is probably due to lateral changes in the  orientation of mantle fabrics.  This
              research will test the  hypothesis that "anisotropic domains," coherent volumes
              of  strained mantle rock related to past tectonic activity, are the  primary
              source of traveltime heterogeneity.  The data are to come  from seismograms 
              recorded by the recent high density of fixed  and portable stations in the
              northeastern U.S. to form a dataset  of body wave traveltimes and shear wave
              splitting measurements.  ***
