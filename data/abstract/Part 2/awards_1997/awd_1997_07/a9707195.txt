Abstract    :
              9707195  Ho    This project aims to use variable low temperature scanning 
              tunneling microscopy operating under ultrahigh vacuum conditions  to induce and
              view directly the dissociation and formation of  chemical bonds with atomic
              resolution of molecules adsorbed on  metal surfaces.  Chemistry is reduced to
              studying single  molecules in isolation, including the structure and reactivity
              of  individual bonds in a molecule, and as other molecules are  brought to the
              isolated molecule one at a time.  The overall  complexity encountered in an
              ensemble of many interacting  molecules will be removed and added in a
              controlled way.  %%%  This investigation will provide important advances in our
               understanding of chemical and biological systems.  The study of  the intrinsic
              properties of single molecules (isolated from  intermolecular or collective or
              environmental effects) and their  controlled interactions and reactions with
              other molecules is  relevant to the advancement of emerging technologies such
              as  those based on electronic and optical nanostructured materials.  ***
