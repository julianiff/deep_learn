Abstract    :
              9707031  Gorelick    This award provides partial support (72%) for the
              acquisition of a  computer system for the Department of Geological and
              Environmental  Sciences at Stanford University. The system will be used
              primarily  for research and teaching in the Stanford hydroscience programs on 
              a broad variety of hydrogeologic and near-surface hydrologic  problems such as
              the spatial patterns of aquifer and fractured-rock  flow, the migration of
              non-aqueous liquids through the unsaturated  zone, the use of groundwater
              storage for drought protection, and  soil classification and geostatistical
              approaches for improving the  characterization of near-surface soil hydraulic
              properties. Much of  the work of the hydrology group at Stanford requires
              intensive  computing. Stanford University is committed to providing the 
              remaining 28% of the funds required for this acquisition.  ***
