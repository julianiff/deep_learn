Abstract    :
              In this project of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in the  
              Chemistry Division with support for instrumentation from the Office of  
              Multidisciplinary Activities, Prof. Harry Tom will develop and   characterize a
              new type of coherent spectroscopy for surface optical   phonons and for low
              frequency adsorbate-substrate vibrational modes.  The   work here will
              establish general mechanisms for creating and detecting   coherent phonon
              oscillations on a large number of surfaces.  Establishing   the energy and
              dephasing relaxation times for these low frequency modes   is an outstanding
              problem in surface dynamics.  Both semiconductor (GaAs   and Si) and metal (Cu
              and alkali-covered Cu) surfaces will be examined.  The time-resolved surface
              second-harmonic generation signal (TRSHG)   technique to be developed here has
              several advantages over existing   spectroscopic techniques, such as better
              spectral resolution and higher   signal-to-noise ratio, and it is the only
              coherent technique for studying   surface phonons.
