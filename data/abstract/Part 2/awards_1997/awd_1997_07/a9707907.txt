Abstract    :
              This RUI project will investigate aspects of the coronal heating problem through
              mapping temperature of the solar corona and studying the oscillation spectrum
              of coronal loops during the low-background circumstances of an eclipse. 
              Observations provide tests of proposed mechanisms to explain the heating of the
              solar corona via weakly compressive magnetohydrodynamic waves.  The 26 February
              1998 total solar eclipse will provide more and brighter loops because of the
              rising phase of the solar activity cycle.  These new observations will greatly
              improve previously published results, as well as distinguish between standing
              and propagating waves.
