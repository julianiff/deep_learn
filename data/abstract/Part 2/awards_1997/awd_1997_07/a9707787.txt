Abstract    :
                McPeek  9707787    Almost all organisms must find enough food for themselves 
              while trying not to become food for another organism. These  are also often
              conflicting objectives; the properties that  make an organism better at finding
              food often makes it worse  at avoiding predators. Although this tradeoff in
              abilities  is commonly observed in many taxa, the underlying phenotypic 
              architecture that generates this fundamental trade-off is  poorly understood.
              In this proposal the PI will describe  research to explore the properties of
              organisms generating  such a trade-off between growth and predator avoidance in
               larval damselflies (Insecta), and to reconstruct how these  properties have
              evolved as this taxon has shifted between  habitats with different predators
              and different resource  availabilities. The PI will conduct studies of four 
              different organismal properties to explore the underlying  causes of this
              trade-off, including differences in (1)  movement and activity, (2) burst
              swimming ability and  anaerobic physiological capacities, (3) digestive 
              efficiency, and (4) aerobic metabolic capacity. Analyses  will test hypotheses
              about the functional couplings among  characters and the evolution of these
              functional couplings.  Examining how these functional couplings have evolved 
              provides valuable insights into the constraints affecting  taxa as they adapt
              to natural and anthropogenically-induced  environmental change (e.g., natural
              habitat shifts, climate  change, habitat degradation).
