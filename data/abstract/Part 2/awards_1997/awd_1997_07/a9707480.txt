Abstract    :
              9707480  Ansari    This is a Research Planning Grant for Women Scientists and
              Engineers.  Dr. Ansari intends to study the DNA helix-coil transition pathway,
              and identify and characterize possible intermediates along that pathway.  She
              intends to do this by initiating the uncoiling transition and monitoring the
              kinetics of relaxation back to equilibrium.    There is some evidence that
              suggests that flanking sequences outside a primary interaction site between a
              section of DNA and a ligand can render the DNA duplex more unstable, resulting
              in an increased reactivity with the ligand. The experiments described will
              ultimately contribute to our understanding of the interplay of the structural,
              thermodynamic, and dynamic characteristics of DNA and the recognition
              mechanisms of reacting ligands and proteins.  ***
