Abstract    :
                This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program,  
              involves bringing together a group of academic, industrial, and  governmental
              scientists, with broad experience in the area of  chemical  sensing, for a
              Workshop that aims to enhance the US position in  this field  in the global
              arena.  Professor Richard M. Crooks of Texas A & M  University, together with
              Dr. Jiri Janata of Pacific Northwest  National  Laboratory and Dr. Antonio J.
              Ricco of Sandia National  Laboratories, are  the organizing committee for this
              Workshop.  This Workshop will  describe  the current state of chemical sensing
              and then target those areas  in  chemical sensing that can be best attacked by
              an  interdisciplinary  approach.  The status of US work in chemical sensors
              will be  improved  through this Workshop.  The US is not a world leader in the
              area of chemical sensing.   This  Workshop on chemical sensing aims to describe
              the current status  of  chemical sensing in the US and then to foster an 
              interdisciplinary group  approach to moving basic laboratory research in this
              area to  practical  devices for the market place.  Workshop participants come
              from  academe,  industry, and government.
