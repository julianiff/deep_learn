Abstract    :
              Two species of African forest chimpanzees are commonly recognized, the `common`
              chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and the pygmy chimpanzee, or bonobo (Pan
              paniscus).  Biologists and anthropologists have traditionally regarded Pan
              troglodytes as having three distinct subspecies.  However, a pilot involving
              field work in Nigeria and mitochondrial DNA analysis in the laboratory, has
              revealed that there may be four Pan troglodytes subspecies, and that the
              distribution and relationships among these subspecies are different than what
              is usually portrayed.  This proposed research aims to extend the pilot study
              both by making much more extensive field collections of hairs from the sleeping
              nests of West African chimpanzees, and by analyzing a much wider range of
              mitochondrial and nuclear genes in the laboratory.  The results of the research
              will be compared with information on the distribution and evolutionary
              relationships of other African forest primates with the goal of reconstructing
              a clearer picture of the evolutionary history of our closest relatives.  The
              results will also be of great relevance to conservation.  Chimpanzees are
              becoming increasingly endangered, and in planning for their conservation it is
              vital that genetically distinct populations are given proper attention.
