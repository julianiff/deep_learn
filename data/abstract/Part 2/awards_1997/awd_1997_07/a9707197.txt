Abstract    :
              9707197  BARBER        The  HATTERAS  is  a 135' general purpose  research 
              vessel constructed  in 1981.  The ship is owned by the  National  Science
              Foundation and operated by Duke University  under a Charter  Party Agreement. 
              In February 1997 the  vessel returns to active service after  being  in  lay-up
               status  during  1996.   The  vessel  is scheduled for 235  days in 1997, of
              which 120 days are in  support of NSF-  funded programs.  The Navy will use the
              vessel for 99 days  in  support  of programs for ONR, NRL and NAVO.  In
              addition  the vessel will provide 16 days support for DOE, Sea Grant,  State 
              of North   Carolina   and  Virginia  Institute  of  Marine     Science 
              oceanographic programs.        The  HATTERAS  is  part of a fleet of  ships 
              used  by  the National             Science  Foundation  in  support  of  marine
              science  research.  Most oceanographic projects require highly  specialized
              equipment  be  permanently installed  on  the  vessel,  thus  the necessity 
              for specialized ships.  The  HATTERAS will operate  off the New England and
              mid-Atlantic  coast.  ***
