Abstract    :
              Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology which allows for visual interactive
              analyses of large data sets; essentially, VR displays interactive three
              dimensional worlds in near real-time.  Haptics is the field which studies human
              computer interaction.  Several type of haptic devices currently available are
              also capable of also delivering forces back to the user through a handle, or
              "joystick." The Finite Element Method (FEM) is an established computational
              method which allows engineers to study the deformation of physical bodies
              subjected to external force and displacements.  It is feasible to combine these
              established technologies to create a platform for Physically-Based Virtual
              Reality (PBVR).  This project will design and experiment with such a PBVR
              platform, consisting of a PC-based data-acquisition system, a haptic-feedback
              joystick, and a UNIX-based immersive visualizer.
