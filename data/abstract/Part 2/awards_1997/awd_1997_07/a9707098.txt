Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    97-07098  Vander Wall  The effects of seed water content on the
              foraging success and cache management behavior of rodents    The ways that
              animals interact with seeds are important focuses of population and community
              ecology, but the role of the physical environment in these interactions has
              often been ignored. The water content of the soil influences the ability of
              rodents to detect buried seeds using olfaction. Seeds imbibe water from the
              soil after it has rained. Rodents find seeds in moistened soil significantly
              faster than seeds in dry soil. This research project consists of four field
              experiments designed to reveal how seed/soil water affects how individual
              rodents find buried seed caches. Topics of experiments are: (1) the role of
              spatial memory versus olfaction as mechanisms for cache retrieval and
              management, (2) the comparative olfactory sensitivities of different rodent
              varieties, (3) the effect of residence time on the detectability of seeds
              buried in moist soil, and (4) how cache size and depth influence detectability
              of seeds.
