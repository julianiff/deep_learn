              Abstract  ATM-9707698  Bradley, Raymond S.  University of Massachusetts  Title:
              Precipitation Variability in the Inter-tropical Andes -  Climatological Studies
              for Paleoclimatic Reconstruction    This proposal os to study relationships
              between Atlantic SST and  the precipitation in the inter-tropical Andes on the
              inter-annual-  decadal time scales.  Isotopes data over the Andes, where
              important  ice core records were recovered, will be examined to develop an 
              empirical model relating circulation changes to isotopic  variations.  This
              study will utilize Atlantic SST anomalies data,  upper air data over tropical
              South America, precipitation data from  a dense network of stations along the
              tropical Andean range, and  stable isotope data.  This research will help
              interpreting Holocene  climatic record of tropical ice cores and will thus
              throw some  light on the climatic conditions in that distant past.
