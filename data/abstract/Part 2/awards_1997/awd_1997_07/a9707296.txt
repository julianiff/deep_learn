                    ABSTRACT    PROPOSAL # : DEB-9707296, DEB-9708376    INVESTIGATOR(S) :
              BURKE     JOHNSON    INSTITUTION: COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY         DESERT
              RESEARCH INSTITUTE,  UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA      Although much research has
              focused on the biotic mechanisms by which ecosystems retain N, there has been
              relatively little attention paid to nonbiological fixation (capture) of N in
              soils.  The available evidence suggests that soils are capable of fixing N in
              chemical sinks such as humus and clay lattices but controls on this fixation
              are poorly understood and the processes of chemical fixation are not included
              in the leading biogeochemical models.  It is important to fill this gap in our
              understanding if we are to be able to predict and understand effects on soils
              of global increases in both atmospheric N deposition and fertilizer use.  The
              aims of this proposal are to investigate controls on the long-term accumulation
              of nitrogen in soils, particularly by nonbiological chemical fixation, and to
              determine the ecosystem consequences of increased nonbiological N retention in
              grassland soils in Colorado.  The research design combines experimental
              addition of  15-N containing compounds, followed by sophisticated chemical
              analysis of chemical transformations.  A second series of experiments involves
              addition of humus precursors to the soil.
