Abstract    :
              9707051  Perry    This project deals with several problems in spectral geometry:
              the inverse spectral problem for compact surfaces; trace formulas and dynamical
              zeta functions for the Laplacian on hyperbolic manifolds and associated vector
              bundles; the scattering operator and its determinant as a function on the
              deformation space of a Kleinian group. Techniques to be employed include
              perturbation theory, global analysis, and Teichmuller theory. One of the aims
              of this project is to show that the isopectral set of a compact surface is
              finite for metrics close to constant curvature.    Spectral geometry is
              concerned with the interaction of differential-geometric properties of a
              Riemannian manifold (a curved space with a metric) with the spectra of natural
              differential operators associated with it. The spectrum of an operator often
              captures various analytic properties of an otherwise intractable differential
              operator in a discrete and computable manner. Elucidating the geometric content
              of various spectral data then is the main concern of spectral geometry.
