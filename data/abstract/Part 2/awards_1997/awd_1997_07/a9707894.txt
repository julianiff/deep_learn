Abstract    :
              9707894  Camp, Tracy  Computing Research Association    Special Project: Travel
              Grant Support for Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Conference   
              On September 19-21, 1997, the second Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in
              Computing Conference is being held at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose,
              California.  The meeting is a technical conference presenting talks by
              successful women in the computing field, short technical presentations by a
              range of conference participants, as well as panels, workshops, and
              birds-of-a-feather sessions.  This grant provides travel costs and registration
              expenses for approximately eighty people in computing and related fields who
              otherwise would be unlikely to attend.  The awards are made to selected
              advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and people early in their
              processional careers.  Cost sharing by the institutions represented covers part
              of the costs for a large majority of the participants.
