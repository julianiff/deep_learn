Abstract    :
              9707030  Reyes  This  Planning Grant  is to develop a systematic study of  the
              interaction between hydrolysable polymers and microbial  enzymes that can
              catalyze the polymer degradation.  Polymers  will be chosen that have
              potentially hydrolysable backbone  functionality, e.g., polyesters, polyamides,
              etc.  The  enzymes will be chosen from four classes of hydrolases  including
              lipases, proteases, and cutinases.  The enzymes  will be tested individually
              and in combinations.  The impact  of physical environment and the possible
              impact of natural  adjuvants such as salts and biosurfactants, will be 
              investigated.  ***
