Abstract    :
              A three-year investigation of Greenland's influence on the atmospheric
              circulation of the North Atlantic region is proposed.  Observational analyses
              and mesoscale simulations will examine the impact of extremes of the North
              Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on Greenland cyclonic activity and describe the
              casual mechanisms.  In particular, the influences of Greenland topography
              including the role of the katabatic winds are evaluated.  The observational
              analyses will provide details on cyclone climatology in this important, yet
              little-studied, region.  The mesoscale numerical model to be used is the
              Pennsylvania State University/National Center for Atmospheric Research
              Mesoscale Model version 5 (MM5) modified for ice sheet meteorology.  The
              numerical study will be divided into two parts:  a moderately high resolution
              set of seasonal simulations to produce detailed statistics for both phases of
              the NAO, and a set of very high resolution simulations of representative
              cyclonic events to better understand their dynamics.
