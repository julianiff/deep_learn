Abstract    :
              The Center for Applied Mathematics at Cornell University will  purchase computer
              equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research in the
              mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used  for several research
              projects in mathematics, including in particular:    Stochastic spatial models
              in the biological sciences    Computational analysis of dynamical systems   
              Computational research in coding theory    Computational Algebraic Geometry   
              Computation of Eigenvalues and Applications
