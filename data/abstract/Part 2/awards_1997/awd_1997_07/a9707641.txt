Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    97-07641  Kilham and Kreeger  Collaborative Research: Effects of
              Seston Quantity and Quality on Zooplankton in a Mesotrophic Lake    Zooplankton
              are small animals that abound in lakes where they serve as critical links in
              the food chain.  Zooplankton feed on microscopic plant, animal and dead organic
              material, called seston.  Like most animals, they are known to be negatively
              affected by poor food availability and quality.  This research will use
              microencapsulation technology to produce a variety of artificial seston
              particles containing specific biochemicals.  These will be analyzed for their
              suitability as zooplankton diets by measuring digestibility.  The best
              particles will be delivered to zooplankton as nutritional supplements to an
              otherwise poor diet, and any increase in animal performance will be
              definitively attributed to the specific biochemical in the supplement.  Results
              of this study will help launch a broader research program to examine how
              natural, mixed populations of zooplankton can be nutritionally limited, a topic
              widely perceived to be a fundamental hurdle to an improved understanding of
              aquatic ecology.
