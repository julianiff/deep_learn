Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT   DMS-9707022    The Twenty-first Summer Real Analysis Symposium will
              be held on the  University of Tennessee at Chattanooga campus June 18-21, 1997.
              The  chairperson for the meeting will be Harry Miller, Head of the UTC 
              Mathematics Department. Professors Ali Alikhani, Paul Humke and  Clifford Weil
              will serve on the organizing committee. It is anticipated  that  new results
              will be presented from the fields of one  dimensional dynamics, generalized
              derivatives and integration theory.   As in the past the symposium will
              continue to establish links to  different but related areas of analysis such as
              harmonic analysis,   measure theory and analytic set theory.   This conference
              will act as a staging area for future joint     research projects and will
              assist graduate students (it is   anticipated that several will attend) and
              junior faculty    along their career paths.      The Summer Real Analysis
              Symposium that will take place on   the campus of the University of Tennessee
              at Chattanooga on   June 18-21,1997 has multiple objectives. The participants
              of the   Symposium will run the spectrum from graduate students, to untenured  
              young professors to established stars in the field of real analysis.   This
              mix, with three of the four invited  principal speakers being    young
              mathematicians, who already have very fine track records,   should be very
              stimulating for all the participants.   These symposia have been  successful in
              generating both   collaborative and independent research activity. The
              Chattanooga   symposium will be  attended by a  number of mathematicians   from
              Canada and Europe.
