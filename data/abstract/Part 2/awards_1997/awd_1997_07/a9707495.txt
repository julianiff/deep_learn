Abstract    :
              The proposed experimental methods will allow: (1) the use of novel laser   flash
              techniques for unprecedented levels of control of polymerizing   systems; (2)
              measurement of concentrations of free radical polymerization   living chains
              over a broad range of conditions by a multitechnique   approach; (3)
              measurement of molecular weight distributions of living   chains by a novel
              `photocopying` technique; (4) characterization of   structures and dynamics of
              the radical end-groups; and (5) controlled   generation of well-characterized
              monodisperse macroradicals to test   fundamentals of polymer reaction kinetics
              by specific syntheses of   monodisperse macroradicals.  A range of theoretical
              predictions will thus   be tested by these experiments.    With this award, the
              Organic Dynamics Program and the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities are
              supporting the research of Drs. Nicholas   J. Turro and Ben O'Shaughnessy of
              the Department of Chemistry at Columbia   University.  The project is an
              interdisciplinary joint   experimental-theoretical effort with an object of
              obtaining a mechanistic   understanding of  free radical polymerization and the
              closely associated   phenomena of interpolymeric reactions.  The expertise of a
              photochemist   and a theoretical polymer physicist will unite to allow theory
              to proceed   in close collaboration with experiments employing novel methods to
                measure various fundamental properties of free radical prolymerization   and
              other reacting polymer systems.
