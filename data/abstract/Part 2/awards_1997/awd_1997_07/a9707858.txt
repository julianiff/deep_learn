Abstract    :
              Steven D. Schwartz of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics of the  
              Albert Einstein College of Medicine in  New York  is funded by the   Physical
              Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to study quantum   operator
              approaches to condensed phase and multidimensional reaction   dynamics. In this
              proposal the evolution operator approach to   multidimensional quantum dynamics
              developed by the PI will be used to   discuss the kinetics of chemical
              reactions in condensed  media. The   technique will be improved and further
              developed, in particular to deal   properly with nonlinear effects. These
              results will be  used to study   proton tunneling in benzoic acid and proton
              transfer in enzymes.  This research will develop a first principles theory for
              chemical   kinetics in condensed phase. The range of application of such work
              is all   of chemistry and biology, within the limits that the complexity of a  
              first principles approach.
