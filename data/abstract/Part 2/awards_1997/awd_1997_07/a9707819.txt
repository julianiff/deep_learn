              In addition they operate the submersible JOHNSON SEA-LINK  and a  Remotely

              operational days in 1997 of which 179 days  are  in  support of NSF-funded
              research.  The ship  will  support  cruises off Brazil, Barbados, s.Africa and
              Puerto Rico.        The  EDWIN  LINK is a 168' general research vessel  with  a
               schedule of 218 operational days in 1997 of which 46 days are  in  support  of
               NSF-funded research.  The ship will support  cruises  for NSF off the Bahamas
              and the Atlantic coast of the US.        The  SEA  DIVER is a 113' general
              research  vessel  with  a  schedule  of 33 operational days in 1997. None are
