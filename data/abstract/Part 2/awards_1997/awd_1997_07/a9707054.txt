Abstract    :
              9707054  Wendlandt    This grant provides $48,962 as one-half support of the
              costs of  upgrading the Cameca MBX electron microprobe (EMP) at the  Colorado
              School of Mines with a PC-based automated instrument  interface, a digital
              imaging system for analyses of backscattered  electron images and crystals
              permitting light element analyses  (i.e. Li, B).  This upgrade is a significant
              improvement over the  current and original (vintage 1980) DEC PDP-11 based
              computer  control system, which is no longer supported by the manufacturer. 
              PC-automation and digital image analysis will benefit a variety  research
              programs currently utilizing the EMP for quantitative  geochemical analysis
              including studies of the petrogenesis of  continental rift volcanics,
              elucidation of the driving forces  behind dolomitization of reef carbonates,
              studies of the phase  equilibria of carbonate systems, and metallurgical
              studies.  Furthermore, this upgrade will provide students with training on 
              software packages that are the current standard at larger  research
              institutions and laboratories.  ***
