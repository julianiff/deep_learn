Abstract    :
              9707270  LiWang    This is a Research Planning Grant for Women Scientists and
              Engineers.  Dr. LiWang will study the interactions involved in dimer formation
              of representative members of the chemokine family of proteins, using a
              combination of biochemical methods and NMR spectroscopy.  This family has
              unique structural properties that allow a detailed assessment of important
              amino acid interactions in the formation of quaternary structure.    
              Chemokines have been divided into two subfamilies, characterized by the ability
              to form different dimer structures despite having similar monomeric subunits. 
              A structural investigation of a chemokine dimer will therefore lead to an
              understanding of the interactions that form the structure of these proteins
              themselves, and shed light on the protein-protein interactions that are
              responsible for dimer formation and stabilization in general.  ***
