Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    97-07461  Heneghan  Linking spatial variation of below-ground faunal
              assemblages with the structure of herbaceous vegetation    Research on the
              ability of plant roots to forage for soil nutrients has shown that dominant
              plants forage widely and ignore small 'hotspots' of high nutrient availability;
              rarer plants forage locally and can locate these hotspots. Arthropods living in
              terrestrial detritus are not uniformly distributed. Their feeding (primarily on
              the microbes involved in the decomposition of detritus) results in the
              liberation of essential nutrients into the soil where growing plants capture
              them.  Thus the heterogenously distributed arthropods create a highly variable
              mosaic of nutrient availability. Combining our knowledge of plants' foraging
              strategies with insights into the faunal genesis of nutrient hotspots in the
              soil the investigators hypothesize that soil faunal activity contributes to the
              maintenance of high plant diversity. This idea will be tested in custom built
              "mini-landscapes" into which soil animals will be introduced and nutrients and
              plant diversity will be subsequently monitored.
