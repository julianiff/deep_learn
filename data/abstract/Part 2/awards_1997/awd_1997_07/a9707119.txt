Abstract    :
              9707119  Farley         This grant provides $149,996 as three years partial
              salary  support for a technician to oversee operation and maintenance and  to
              provide training to new users of the Caltech Noble gas  geochemistry
              laboratory. The addition of a skilled technician to  this facility will allow
              the PI to continue development of novel  and exciting techniques utilizing rare
              gas geochemistry to  elucidate fundamental problems in the Earth sciences. 
              Specific  examples of the PI's accomplishments to date include, the PI's 
              development of apatite helium thermochronology.  This technique  utilizes known
              diffusional rates of 4He from decay of uranium and  thorium series nuclides in
              apatite to constrain cooling  histories.  Additionally, the PI's discovery of
              correlations  between the flux of extraterrestrial helium to seafloor sediments
               and global climate and faunal changes are potentially significant  for our
              understanding of the linkages between the Earth's climate  and extraterrestrial
              factors.  ***
