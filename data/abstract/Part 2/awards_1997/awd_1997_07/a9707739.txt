Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at Brown University will  purchase computer
              equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research in mathematics.
              The equipment will be used  for several areas of mathematics, including number
              theory, problems in the calculus of variations, harmonic analysis, and partial
              differential equations.
