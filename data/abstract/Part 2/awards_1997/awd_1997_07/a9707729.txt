Abstract    :
              9707729  Baneyx  The purpose of  this research is to minimize the improper 
              folding and aggregation of proteins produced in E. coli,  hence reducing a very
              costly part (refolding) of the  downstream processing.  This proposal follows
              previous  observations that a low-temperature, inducible cold-shock  promoter
              drives the proper folding of recombinant proteins.  Unfortunately, after a
              short period the promoter is  repressed at the lower temperature and protein
              production  drops.  The two major aims of the research are to eliminate  the
              repressor gene segment believed to lie on the 5' non-  coding region of the
              cold-shock promoter gene and to  coexpress protein disulfide isomerases to
              promote the proper  folding and disulfide bonding of the proteins.  ***
