Abstract    :
              9707151  Clearfield  The aim of this proposal entitled Pillared Layered
              Compounds:  Their Synthesis, Structure and Properties is to synthesize and 
              characterize novel materials obtained from the pillaring of  layered compounds
              both with inorganic polymers and organic cross-  linking agents.  Four areas
              are emphasized:  pillared metal  phosphates; organically pillared phosphates;
              pillared clays; and  layered double hydroxides.  A large amount of synthetic
              work will  be carried out coupled with materials studies related to  structure
              determination, magnetic measurements, and sorption and  catalysis.  %%%  The
              emphasis on the synthesis of novel materials and their  properties, and the
              manipulation of layered compounds to produce  porous materials with unusual
              properties such as knowledge of  magnetic phenomena in layered compounds, will
              result in  significant contributions to materials chemistry of potentially 
              functional materials for applications such as sensors, molecular  sieves,
              separations media, and catalysts.  ***
