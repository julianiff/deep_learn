Abstract    :
              9707129  Casson  This is an award to provide support for a conference and 
              workshop to discuss progress that has been made in assessing  the survival of
              the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) when  subjected to environmental stress
              in wastewater collection  systems and treatment processes and to identify any
              further  research needs associated with this matter.  Investigators  and
              co-investigators who have conducted and are conducting  research on this and
              related topics with support from the  National Science Foundation and others
              will present their  findings for the purpose of discussion, critical review and
               identification of any further research needs on issues  associated with the
              survival of the HIV when subjected to  environmental stress beyond those
              addressed by current and  past awards.    Results of this conference and
              workshop are expected to  provide guidance for conduct of further research on
              issues  involving survival and fate of the Human Immunodeficiency  Virus (HIV)
              under various environmental conditions.  Conference participation is expected
              to include research  personnel from the National Institutes of Health, the
              United  States Public Health Service, the Environmental Protection  Agency and
              other Federal agencies.  The conference and  workshop will be held at the
              University of Pittsburgh.  ***
