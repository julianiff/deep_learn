Abstract    :
              Professor Jean Chmielewski, Department of Chemistry, Purdue University is  
              supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Program of the Chemistry   Division
              under a Career Advancement Award to enhance her research   expertise in the
              area structural elucidation using heteronuclear NMR   techniques.   The
              interactions leading to the aggregation of five   amphiphilic alpha helical
              peptides, rather the expected four monomeric   units, and the unexpected
              formation of a 1:1 complex between synthetic   helical peptide monomers in
              solution are accessible by heteronuclear NMR.     Professor Chmielewski is a
              highly competent PI, and a sabbatical year   spent in the laboratories of
              investigators at the forefront of protein   structure elucidation by
              heteronuclear NMR will maintain her position at   the cutting edge of the
              protein assembly field.  Proteins and peptides are large, flexible molecules
              whose properties in   fluid solution are determined by the molecular structure
              and aggregation   of the monomeric subunits.   Heteronuclear NMR offers a means
              to   elucidate the structure of these molecules, and to probe the interactions 
               resulting in aggregation of the monomeric subunits in fluid solution.    
              Professor Chmielewski has embarked on a successful academic career, and  
              expertise in heteronuclear NMR will allow her to continue a very   promising
              research program.
