Abstract    :
              The Institute of Statistics and Decision Sciences at Duke University (ISDS) will
              purchase four high-performance graphics workstations with double buffered 3-D
              accelerated graphics, one file server with 26Gb ultra/wide scsi hard disk, and
              a high-performance 100Mbps Fast Ethernet switch.  The equipment will be
              dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical sciences.  It will be
              used for several research projects in spatio-temporal statistical modeling
              including: Dependent spatial point-process models; Interactive design of
              experiments for spatial/temporal data; Statistical models for automated image
              understanding; and Multivariate dynamic models in complex stochastic systems.
