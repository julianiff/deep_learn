Abstract    :
                DEB 9707693  McDade    This project will enable the PI to acquire the skills
              needed to carry out a number of techniques in molecular biology with the goal
              of applying evidence from these techniques to her on-going research in plant
              evolutionary biology.  In particular, the PI's projects that will benefit
              greatly from acquisition of molecular data are:  (1) phylogenetic relationships
              and evolutionary patterns within the large flowering plant family Acanthaceae;
              (2) the pattern of hybridization between species of tropical plants, and the
              evolutionary and conservation implications of such hybridization; and (3)
              patterns of evolutionary differentiation among populations of plants that occur
              on a series of mountain top habitat islands in southwestern North America (U.S.
              states of Arizona and New Mexico, plus the northwestern Mexican states of
              Sonora and Chihuahua).    The research plan has two key components.  First, the
              PI will visit three very active laboratories of molecular plant systematics
              which complement each other in terms of expertise and interests.  These are at
              the Smithsonian Institution (the Laboratory of Molecular Systematics, Dr. E.
              Zimmer, sponsor) and the University of Washington (laboratories of Drs. R.
              Olmstead and  H. Bradshaw).  In addition to providing expertise in key
              techniques that the PI seeks to acquire, these working visits will lead to
              collaborative research efforts.  Second, the PI will implement all of the
              techniques that she acquires via these visits in a communal molecular
              laboratory at her home institution.  This component is critical to ensure the
              long-term success of the project in adding to the PI's suite of research tools.
