Abstract    :
              DEB-9797400  Reynolds     Patrick Reynolds of Hamilton College will examine
              phylogenetic relationships among genera of the Class Scaphopoda, the tusk
              shells.  Scaphopods comprise one of nine classes in the Phylum Mollusca, the
              second largest phylum of animal (and which also includes snails, clams, and
              squid), and are very poorly known in terms of historical genealogy (phylogeny).
               Reynolds will employ soft-part anatomical and ultrastructural characters for
              morphological comparisons and phylogenetic analysis.  Issues to be addressed
              directly in the research are: (i) monophyly of the Orders Dentaliida and
              Gadilia; (ii) monophyly of scaphopod families; and (iii) a system of
              classification for Scaphopoda that reflects phylogenetic relationships and the
              familial and ordinal levels.  The project will have impact on present
              understanding of scaphodpod biology and will provide a significant framework
              for future studies of character evolution, phylogenetic position of fossil
              taxa, and historical biology.  The project is an RUI award and there is
              significant involvement of undergraduate students at Hamilton College in the
              project.
