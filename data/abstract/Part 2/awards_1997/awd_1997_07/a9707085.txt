Abstract    :
              9707085  Pfeiffer  The University of Delaware will operate the R/V CAPE 
              HENLOPEN during 1997 as a general oceanographic research  vessel in support of
              NSF-supported research projects.  The  HENLOPEN is a 120' vessel owned and
              operated by the  University.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 184 
              operational days during 1997, of which 88 are in support of  NSF-supported
              investigators.  The remaining cruises will  support Navy projects.  The
              projects scheduled on the  HENLOPEN span all oceanographic disciplines and will
              fully  utilize the capabilities of the vessel.  All operations are  along the
              U.S. mid-Atlantic coast, including Delaware and  Chesapeake Bays.  ***
