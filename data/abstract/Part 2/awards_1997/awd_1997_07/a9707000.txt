Abstract    :
              Abstract - Puri      This is an experimental and numerical investigation of
              transient effects on the structure and stability of partially premixed
              hydrocarbon-air flames.  The dominant reaction pathways, and their dependence
              on the elvel of premixing, are identified for both steady and unsteady flames
              in both coflow and counterflow configurations.  The effects of perturbing the
              inner layer through acoustic forcing of specified amplitude and frequency on
              the distributin of carbon monoxide and hydrogen as well as on the reaction
              rates of these species and the heat release rates are examined.  Similarly, the
              effects of perturbing the outer layer on ignition and heat release are
              quantified.  Parametric comparisons between sealar profiles and reaction rates
              in coflow and counterflow flames are performed.  Experimental measurements
              include velocity, species, temperature measurements, and high-speed videography
              of flame unsteadiness.
