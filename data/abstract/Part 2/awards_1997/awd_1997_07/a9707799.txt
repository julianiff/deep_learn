Abstract    :
              9707799  Boggess  The PI will study ultrafast carrier dynamics in the
              narrow-band-gap nanostructures typically employed to produce mid-wave infrared
              radiation.  Characterization activities undertaken will specifically focus upon
              the impact of hot carriers on MWIR diode laser performance.  ***
