Abstract    :
                  9707620  Kelley    Sexual reproduction among plants and animals is thought
              to serve an important function   which is to either reduce the incidence of
              disease, by producing genetically variable   offspring which escape infection,
              or to repair genetic damage caused by deleterious   mutations, which accumulate
              in organisms.  The proposed research will investigate the   importance of
              disease and mutation for offspring fitness, using a plant which is capable of  
              both sexual and asexual reproduction.   The fitness effects of viral disease
              and mutational   damage will be measured in a field situation.  Results
              obtained from this research will explain the evolutionary and ecological
              significance of genetic diversity in natural populations.  They will provide a
              measure of the speed with which diseases can evolve increased virulence in
              response to particular host genotypes.    These results will be directly
              relevant to understanding the origin of emerging diseases.    Finally,
              experiments will yield an estimate of the consequences of genetic damage for  
              natural populations.  The consequences of environmental changes affecting
              mutation rates   can be better understood as a result.
