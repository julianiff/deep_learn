Abstract    :
                  9707759  Henter  The proposed research will examine the degree of local
              adaptation in resource use within and between natural populations of a
              parasitic insect over two different ecological scales.  The investigator will
              determine whether parasitoid populations are equally well adapted to  1)
              different beetle host species on the same plant species, and 2) the same beetle
              host species on different plant species.  Quantitative genetic techniques will
              be used to test the null hypothesis that the parasitoid Uscana semifumipennis
              is a generalist across these environments.  Reciprocal transplant experiments
              will allow examination of the whole suite of characters involved in the
              parasitization process.    This information will be placed in an ecological
              context through examination of the temporal distribution of the different hosts
              in their natural environment.  To understand the factors affecting
              parasitization, selection on parasitoids by their hosts will be measured. This
              information will improve our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics between
              host and parasitoid populations, and will assist biological control workers and
              conservationists in their assessment of the lability of host associations in
              entomophagous species.
