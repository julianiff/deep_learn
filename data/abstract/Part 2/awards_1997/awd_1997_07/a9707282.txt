Abstract    :
              9707282  Bhushan  Support is provided for a symposium on the tribological 
              research needs in the area of  micro-electro-mechanical  systems (MEMS). 
              Experts in MEMS and in nanotribology will  assess the state of the art and
              outline the most pressing  needs for basic research to address these needs,
              including  lubricant design, surface treatments, silicon nanotribology,  and
              tribological issues in  MEMS manufacturing.  ***
