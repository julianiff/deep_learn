Abstract    :
              9707800  Snider  A novel technique combining far infra-red spectroscopy and
              near-field scanning microscopy will be used to both investigate the electronic
              subband structure electrostatically-confined and self-assembled quantum dots,
              and to investigate the electronic coupling of these dots.  Electronic coupling
              of dots is of profound importance in device applications.  ***
