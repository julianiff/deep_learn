Abstract    :
              9707973  Aspray, William  Computing Research Association    Special Project: 
              History of the Academic Discipline of Computer Science/Engineering   1945-1980 
                This grant provides support for work toward the development of a history of
              computer science and engineering as an academic discipline in the United States
              in the years 1945 to 1980.  This period begins with the completion of the first
              computer and ends at a time when most research universities had established a
              Ph.D. program in computer science and many colleges and universities had opened
              undergraduate programs.  This project will result in drafts of some of the
              chapters of the history, will include several oral history interviews and will
              culminate in a proposal for completion of the overall effort.
