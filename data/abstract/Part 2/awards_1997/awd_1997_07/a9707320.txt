Abstract    :
              DMR-9707320    A  modest  level of support is being provided  to cover  the 
              costs  associated  with  convening a Planning  Committee  to  institute  the 
              NSF  Workshop on Solid State  Chemistry  and  Materials to be held late in
              1997. Support from NSF will  be  used  to  cover  travel  expenses for  the 
              members  of  the  planning  committee,  and to provide for  meeting  space  at 
              O'Hare Airport in Chicago on Saturday, January 25, 1996.  %%%  An  ad  hoc
              group participating in the 1996 Gordon  Research  Conference  on Solid State
              Chemistry met in July to  discuss  organizing a Workshop in Solid State
              Chemistry and Materials  (SSCM).  A planning committee was formed which then 
              met  at  the  Materials  Research Society Symposium  on  Solid  State 
              Chemistry of Inorganic Materials in Boston in December, 1996  at   which  time 
              the  Proposal  for  Convening  a  Planning  Committee  to Institute a Workshop
              on Solid State  Chemistry  and  Materials  was  discussed and finalized.  The 
              Planning  Committee  meeting will be held on Saturday, January  25  at 
              Chicago's  O'Hare  Airport.   A follow-up  session  is  then  planned  which 
              will involve the Planning Committee  members  who  will  attend  the European
              Gordon Conference  on  Solid  State  Chemistry  in Oxford in the Fall  of  1997
               with  the  objective  of  finalizing  participation  in  the  NSF  SSCM 
              Workshop by the international community working in areas  of  solid state
              chemistry and materials.  ***
