Abstract    :
              9707820  Carignan         The R/V BLUE FIN is used primarily to support research
               programs in biological, physical and chemical oceanography  on the S.E.
              Continental Shelf between Capes Hatteras and  Canaveral. The  Blue Fin is a 72'
              general purpose research  vessel owned and operated by Skidaway Institute of 
              Oceanography.  The vessel is scheduled for 116 operational  days in 1997, all
              are in support of NSF-sponsored research.        The BLUE FIN is part of a
              fleet of ships used by the  National Science Foundation in support of marine
              science.  Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized  equipment and
              extensive support from highly trained crew  members. Increasingly, research
              projects require equipment  which must be permanently installed on the vessel,
              thus  requiring specialized vessels. These vessels do not operate  the same as
              general cargo/fishing vessels, as a result NSF  supports the operation of a
              variety of vessels specifically  dedicated to oceanographic research that are
              operated by  universities and research institutes around the country.  ***
