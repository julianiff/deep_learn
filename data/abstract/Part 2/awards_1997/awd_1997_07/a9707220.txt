Abstract    :
              9707220       Palumbi    The genetic basis for variation in fertilization
              success will be determined by examining the interaction of eggs and sperm from
              a well-studied species of coastal marine invertebrate. Prior work on this
              species, the Hawaiian sea urchin Echinometra mathaei, has shown that different
              males possess different alleles for a gene that determines the attachment of
              sperm to eggs. The proposed research will determine whether males with
              different alleles have sperm with different attachment properties, and if eggs
              tend to be fertilized better by sperm from males with particular alleles. We
              will use a combination of microscopic eterminations of fertilization success of
              different males, and a PCR assay of which sperm actually fertilize which eggs
              to determine the degree to which genetic variation at the sperm attachment
              locus influences fertilization success.   The interaction of eggs and sperm is
              crucial to successful fertilization, yet is one of the most difficult
              biological processes to study. The ability of different males to fertilize eggs
              from a particular female sometimes varies enormously, but we have little idea
              what types of mechanisms might cause this variation. Recently, it has been
              shown in some species that different males differ genetically at loci that
              determine aspects of sperm-egg attachment, and this provides a powerful system
              to investigate for the first time the genetic basis for differences in
              fertilization. The results will illuminate how natural selection might be
              acting to maintain fertilization polymorphisms in natural populations, and may
              help explain the rapid and novel patterns of molecular evolution at genetic
              loci involving gamete interactions.
