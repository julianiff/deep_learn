Abstract    :
              INT 9707863  Beltz        This U.S.-Czech engineering research project between
              Glenn Beltz of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Anna Marchova
              of the Czech Institute of Thermomechanics, Prague, will address mechanical
              failure and atomic scale defect formation.  These processes influence the
              ductile versus brittle nature of structural materials.  Such characteristics
              have significance when considering the performance and reliability of high
              strength steels and advanced intermetallic alloys, especially when they are
              subject to adverse conditions such as low temperature or harsh chemical
              environments.    The researchers intend to model this material behavior on
              macroscopic to atomistic scales.  Specifically, efforts will feature
              examination of: 1) the phenomenon of "brittle" crack growth in pre-existing,
              apparently mobile, dislocations and 2) the role of nanoscale blunting of a
              sharp crack spreading through a dislocation-free zone, embedded in a
              plastically deforming medium.  Results are expected to improve our
              understanding of brittle-to-ductile transition and to yield practical methods
              for reducing the likelihood of brittle failure of structural metallic alloys.  
               This materials engineering research project fuldills the program objective of
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and
              Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence.    ??
