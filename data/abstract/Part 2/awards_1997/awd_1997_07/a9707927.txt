Abstract    :
              ECS-9707927  Dayawansa    It is proposed to study two related aspects of the
              robust stabilization of a parameterized family of nonlinear systems.  The first
              aspect has to do with stabilization of a family when the parameters hover
              around a nominal value at which the linear approximation has a nontrivial
              unstable uncontrollable part.  Such systems are referred to as undergoing
              C-bifurcation.  Proposed research aims at developing analytical tools to
              systematically study dynamical behavior of a control system near a
              C-bifurcation point.  Included among the sought after tools are ways to extract
              out a low dimensional subsystem which contains crucial information, definition
              of pertinent equivalence relations and group actions and ways to study them via
              properties of their linearization, classification, recognition and normal forms
              of low CO-dimensional C-bifurcation, and classification of robust
              stabilizability properties of such normal forms.  The second aspect has to do
              with parameterized families where the parameters are time dependent, but in a
              way in which only partial knowledge is available a priori.  To simplify matters
              parameter variation is assumed to be piecewise constant in time.  Feedback
              control laws are sought to robustly stabilize the family.  Proposed research
              will be carried out within the framework of differential geometric methods in
              nonlinear control theory.  Basic tools will come from singularity theory and
              global differential topology.
