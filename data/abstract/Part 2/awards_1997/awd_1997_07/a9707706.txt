Abstract    :
                  9707706   Service   The goal of this project is to identify genes that
              control senescence in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.  The fruit fly is
              a "model" organism that has been used for many years to investigate fundamental
              genetic questions.  The flies to be used in this study are from populations
              that have a more than two-fold difference in average life span as a result of
              selective breeding in the laboratory.  This difference in life span is due to
              differences in rates of senescence.  Flies that undergo more rapid senescence
              have shorter life spans.  This project will provide data on the number of genes
              responsible for differences in life span and senescence between these fly
              populations.  It will also enable identification of the approximate chromosomal
              locations of these genes.   This project will contribute to our understanding
              of the molecular and genetic basis of aging.  Because all animals share many
              basic similarities at the molecular and cellular levels, this project may
              provide results that are broadly applicable to the many animal species that
              undergo aging and senescence, including humans.
