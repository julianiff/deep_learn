Abstract    :
              DMS-9707673    The Department of Statistics at Case Western Reserve University
              will  purchase computer equipment which will be dedicated to the support of
              research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used  for several
              research projects in mathematics, including in particular: inference and
              diagnostics for generalized linear mixed models, nonparametric inference
              including bump hunting problems, development and study of fractal and enhanced
              Burgers-KPZ hydrodynamic interface-growth models, projection pursuit and biased
              sampling, small area inference for random variables, Bayesian order restricted
              inference, spatial statistics and design of experiments for high dimensional
              problems.
