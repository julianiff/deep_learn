Abstract    :
              LOMOLINO  DEB-9707204    The proposed study will assess the effects of
              fragmentation and the potential benefits of corridors on the diversity of small
              mammals inhabiting old-growth forests of the Olympic Peninsula in northwest
              Washington.  The investigators will study and characterize the differences in
              mammalian communities inhabiting continuous old-growth, fragmented old-growth,
              riparian corridors of old-growth, and second-growth forests.  The investigators
              will study patterns in species richness and species composition and investigate
              how these patterns are influenced by landscape connectivity.  This information
              has, and will continue to contribute, to the development of a species-based,
              hierarchical model of biogeography.      The results of these studies will
              provide information critical to conserving native communities in these ancient
              temperate rainforests.  Because many of the mammal species studied serve as
              prey for other vertebrates, including spotted owls, this study will also
              provide important information for endangered species management and the use of
              forests as a resource in the Pacific Northwest.
