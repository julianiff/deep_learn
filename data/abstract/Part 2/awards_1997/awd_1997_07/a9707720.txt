Abstract    :
              9707720  Erlandson  This activity focuses on the expansion of the Enabling 
              Technologies Laboratory (ETL) at the university.  The ETL is  involved in the
              execution of inter-disciplinary student design  projects.  These projects cover
              many areas of engineering  including robotics, computer science, and mechanical
              engineering.  The student projects are based on consumer/user needs for a range
               of individuals with severe, multiple impairments to those with  mild cognitive
              impairments.  The proposed projects include game  packages with therapeutic or
              educational content, multi-media  language and mathematics assessments for
              pre-school and early  elementary school children, and a variety of sorting
              devices and  material handling systems for vocational rehabilitation.  ***
