Abstract    :
              9707529  Stegeman  Professor Stegeman will extend his studies of bright spatial
              solitons in quadratic nonlinear media using nonlinear materials with larger
              quadratic nonlinearities, and will demonstrate utility of such solitons in a
              variety of applications.  ***
