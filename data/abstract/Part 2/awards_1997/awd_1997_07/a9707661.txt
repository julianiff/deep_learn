Abstract    :
              9707661    Simon    The spectral analysis of Schrodinger operators with slowly 
              decaying or ergodic potentials will be studied.  Making use  of recent results
              of Last-Simon, Kiselev-Last-Simon, and  Jitomirskaya-Last, the project examines
              fractal properties  of spectral measures and related issues of long time for  
              quantum dynamics.  A major thrust will be to attempt to extend  to general
              dimension the ideas, techniques, and results  developed for one-dimensional
              systems.  Among open questions  which will be examined is the existence of  
              mixed singular continuous and absolutely continuous spectra  in explicit
              models.    Spectral analysis of differential operators has been a major  theme
              of twentieth century analysis and theoretical physics.  Recent studies have
              shown that potentialities that were allowed  by classical works of Weyl,
              Titchmarsh, Hartman, and Wintner  not only occur, but are not pathological as
              was suggested  by these classical works.  Links were made with ideas of   chaos
              science, particularly with notions of Hausdorff dimension.  It is proposed to
              study these ideas further, to extend them from  the model one space dimension
              of earlier works to physically  relevant three dimensions,  and to explore the
              consequences for  the long-time dynamics of quantum systems.
