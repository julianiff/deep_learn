Abstract    :
                  This study proposes to conduct a preliminary survey of arctic sea stars in
              the family Asteriidae located in the Bering Sea.  The PIs are proposing an
              exploratory molecular phylogenetic study that addresses a fundamental question
              about the evolution of echinoderm larval forms and adaptation to polar
              conditions.  The study will investigate the evolutionary history of brooding
              and non-brooding sea stars the central and southern Bering Sea by taking
              advantage of an extensive database on reproductive mode in Arctic sea stars and
              a unique opportunity to collect critically needed sea star species.  The work
              will involve the use of an already planned cruise in the Bering Sea by the
              USFWS vessel Tiglax in the summer of 1997 to the Pribilof Islands and central
              Aleutian Islands.  Because these opportunities are time sensitive and likely
              not to occur again for a decade, the PIs have chosen to submit a proposal of
              limited scope under the guidelines of the Small Grants for Exploratory Research
              (SGER) program.
