Abstract    :
              9707368  Maddison    The proposed work is a reconstruction of the phylogenetic
              history of jumping spiders of the genus Habronattus, a primarily North American
              group of 95 described species. DNA sequence data from about 70 species will be
              gathered for at least three genes, which together with morphological data will
              be analyzed to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of the species. 
              Then, using the phylogeny, patterns of character change in chromosomes and
              behaviors will be studied.  Available data indicate that an XXXY chromosome
              system has arisen several times independently.  One question to be studied is
              whether shifts in chiasma localization released a constraint to allow repeated
              derivations of the XXXY system.  Another focus is courtship behavior.  While
              females are cryptically colored, males of many species have elaborate and
              colorful markings and structures, and engage in complex behaviors during
              courtship.  Behavioral data will be analyzed on the phylogeny to seek patterns
              in the character changes by which one complex style of courtship is derived
              from another, and in distributions of colors and motions in male behavior. 
              These studies will advance our understanding of chromosomal and behavioral
              change, and hence of the forces and constraints underlying diversification.
