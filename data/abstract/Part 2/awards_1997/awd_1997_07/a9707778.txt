Abstract    :
                  CTS-9707778  R.G. LARSON  UNIV. OF MICHIGAN          SUMMARY       Brownian
              dynamics simulations will be performed to predict the stretching    behavior of
              long DNA molecules in simple flows, including uniform extensional,     
              uniform, shear, and plane Poiseuille flows.  The results of these simulations
              will be     compared directly with experiments on single long, fluorescing,
              molecules of DNA in    corresponding simple flows.     The research will
              consider the transient process by which long polymer molecules    stretch out
              in extensional or shear flows, and determine whether or not the physical forces
                 that describe uniform flows at steady state work for the complex unraveling
              transient     flow processes.  The simulations, when combined with the
              experimental results, may also     help explain why light scattering studies
              indicate little polymer stretching in such flows.    These studies have
              applications not only in traditional areas of polymer fluid mechanics,    Such
              as turbulent drag reduction and now through porous media, but are also relevant
              to     Technologies involving DNA micro-manipulation, including the new
              technology of    "fluid fixation", i.e., the use of hydrodynamic flows to
              stretch long DNA molecules to aid    in genetic mapping.
