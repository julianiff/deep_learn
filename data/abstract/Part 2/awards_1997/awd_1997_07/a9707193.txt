Abstract    :
              9707193  Silver    Extensive geophysical and geochemical evidence indicates that
              mantle plumes interact strongly with nearby ocean ridges.  The PIs propose a
              four-part study to investigate the dynamics of this   process and its
              geophysical implications.  The first involves numerical modeling of plume-ridge
              interaction using lubrication theory, a 3-D convection model with variable
              viscosity,  and boundary integral methods. The principal aim will be to
              determine scaling laws for the length of ridge affected by the plume, the
              fraction of the plume flux reaching the ridge, and the maximum plume-ridge
              interaction distance.  The second task is laboratory experiments on the
              chemical and thermal the interaction of plumes with stationary and migrating
              ridges. This work will provide an experimental test of the scaling laws
              determined in part 1.  The third task is the application of the 3-D convection
              model to the Galapagos hotspot with the goal of constraining critical aspects
              of the dynamics and structure of the mantle beneath the hotspot, such as the  
              excess temperature and the distribution of buoyant material and geochemical
              heterogeneities. 3-D dynamical modelling of seismic anisotropy and shear-wave
              splitting observations near the Iceland hotspot are the fourth project task.
              The aim is to resolve the controversial question of the width and excess
              temperature of the plume that generates Iceland.  ***
