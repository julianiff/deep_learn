Abstract    :
                  Goda, Yukiko  IBN - 9707516  Information in the brain is encoded as
              electrical impulses.  The transfer of information between brain cells - a
              process  critical for myriad of brain function - is accomplished by  converting
              electrical signal into  chemical signal at synapses  which are specialized
              points of  cell-cell contact.  It is likely that cell surface  adhesive
              molecules play an important role at synapses much  like adhesion molecules
              present at cell-cell contact sites  of non-brain cells.  Nevertheless, little
              is known of the  role of cell surface adhesive molecules at brain synapses. 
              There are many different classes of cell surface adhesion  molecules that are
              classified according to their functional  and structural relatedness.  This
              project addresses the role  of protein family known as Integrins are important
              for  linking extracellular matrix molecules with intracellular  proteins
              crucial for maintaining the structural organization  within cells.  The aim of
              this proposal is to establish the  expression pattern of integrins at brain
              synapses, and to  determine the role of integrins in regulating signal 
              transfer across synapses.  The experimental system consists  of dissociated
              brain cells which after culturing in an  incubator, form synapses with
              physiological properties  indistinguishable from those found in living brain. 
              Preliminary results demonstrate that integrins are present  at synapses in
              cultured brain cells, and regulate functional  aspects of signal transfer at
              synapses. The experiments  outlined in this proposal are designed to further
              delineate  the mechanism by which integrins modulate information  transfer at
              synapses.
