Abstract    :
              9707117  Kindervater    "Constructivist Reflections: World of Water Project
              Planning" is a  planning activity to be carried out by Discovery 2000, Inc. 
              They  are developing a 14,000 sq. ft. area of aquatic exhibits and  support
              spaces that will increase visitors understanding of the  science concepts
              related to water, aquatic habitats, and organisms.   The exhibit area will be
              developed in two phases.  Phase I will be  completed in the spring of 1998.  It
              will consist of 15 or so  fresh-and saltwater habitat tanks, a learning
              laboratory, a small  program theater, a salt marsh touch pool and eight
              interactive  exhibits.  Phase II, for which this planning support will be used,
               will consist of an additional 25 interactive exhibits and  associated
              programs.  The Phase I area will serve as an  experimental laboratory for the
              creation of the Phase II learning  activities.    With this planning grant,
              they will hold three staff development  workshops, a planning seminar focusing
              on the learning theory of  constructivism and how it can inform and drive
              exhibit and program  development, produce a report of the seminar proceedings,
              and  identify and recruit a national advisory team to assist with the 
              development of Phase II.  As a result of the planning activity  their staff
              will be informed about constructivist theory and its  application to museum
              exhibits and activities, they will increase  their knowledge of front-end
              evaluation strategies, they will  develop new community and professional
              partnerships, and they will  have a plan to use as they move forward with the
              implementation of  Phase II exhibits.
