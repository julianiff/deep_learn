Abstract    :
              Abstract    OPP-9707960    Koester/Syron    This dissertation research studies
              the development of Magadan, Siberia as a penal colony in the Stalinist period
              and evaluates the role of memories of this experience in the historical
              consciousness, social relations, and institutions of Magadan. As rapid social,
              political, and economic transformation takes place in Russia, memories of
              Soviet times are affecting and selectively being brought to bear on the
              present.  By observing the effects and studying the conscious deployment od
              these memories, the project offers insight into the impact of socialist and
              nationalist ideologies, state policies of cultural reform and social
              construction, and the construction of historical representation, individual
              experience, and personal memory.   These are addressed using personal
              testimonies of ex-prisoners and early residents, in-depth interviewing, and
              archival research.
