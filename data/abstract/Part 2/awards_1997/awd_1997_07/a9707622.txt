Abstract    :
              9707622  Fitzpatrick  This proposal will support the continuation of a long-term
              study of the ecology, demography, and conservation biology of the Florida Scrub
              Jay, a species listed as federally threatened. The study of a color-marked
              population at Archbold Biological Station in south-central Florida has
              proceeded uninterrupted since 1969. The study has produced a important
              discoveries in animal behavior, sociobiology, demography, life history theory,
              evolution, and ecology, and has spawned widespread attention to the
              conservation biology of an ancient ecosystem unique to Florida. In addition to
              labor-intensive demographic monitoring of about 60 Florida Scrub Jay
              territories, current field work emphasizes 1) distribution of arthropod,
              vertebrate, and plant food resources through space and time, 2) long-term
              effects of natural fire cycles and post-fire succession on jay demography,
              resource availability, and oak reproductive effort; 3) the role of episodic
              disease in population regulation; and 4) source-sink dynamics in natural as
              compared with human-modified habitats. Recent completion of a major program of
              GIS data-preparation, and a series of large-scale field experiments employing
              prescribed burning, have opened new opportunities to understand the long-term
              effects of environmental variation and natural perturbation within the Florida
              scrub ecosystem. Overall, this project uill continue the extensive regime of
              question-driven ecological monitoring which represents the foundation of this
              long-term study.
