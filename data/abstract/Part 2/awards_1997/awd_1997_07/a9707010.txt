Abstract    :
              This research is an important step to modeling contributions to the solar
              irradiance and full-Sun indices often used as substitutes for direct solar
              irradiance measurements.  The PI will address three major aspects of magnetic
              fields' variability and their relation to emission sources on the Sun as solar
              activity moves from low to high levels with the rise of cycle 23.  First, she
              will investigate how redistribution of magnetic flux and the changing
              connections between magnetic structures resulting from the emergence and
              evolution of active regions relate to identifiable variations in spectral
              irradiance.  Second, she'll question the effect of coronal holes in modulating
              the UV and EUV irradiance, potentially a significant player in the radiative
              output at shorter wavelengths.  Finally, she hopes to more fully understand the
              mapping functions between spectral intensity and magnetic flux density for
              different magnetic structures, particularly in the differences between plage
              and the network.  This will then relate magnetic field intensities to
              measurable parameters of the magnetic field structure and its evolution, and
              thus, effect on, irradiances.
