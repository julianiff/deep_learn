Abstract    :
              This project is experimenting with languages, compilers, and architectures for 
              large-scale multiprocessors based on functional programming and single
              assignment  data structures.  The project includes work at USC on translators
              for functional  languages, and work at the University of Delaware on
              architectures and  simulations.  The key insight motivating the work is that
              functional programming  can increase performance of multithreaded systems.  One
              increase of performance  comes from the ability to move threads among
              processors.  Another is the  possibility that single assignment data structures
              can be cached with no need for  coherence traffic, potentially increasing
              performance of parallel systems.   Research will include development of a
              program execution model and memory model,  design of a cache management
              protocol for single-assignment data structures,  translation of benchmarks such
              as SPLASH 2 into a functional language, and  simulation of the benchmarks
              running on the new execution model with cache  protocol.  The goal is to
              measure the extent to which the new models and cache  protocols provide a
              performance advantage over execution models that permit  multiple assignments.
