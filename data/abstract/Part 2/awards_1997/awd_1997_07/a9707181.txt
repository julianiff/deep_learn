Abstract    :
              9707181  Kenny  This is an NSF/DARPA/NASA collaborative project in which Kenny
              (Stanford) will continue the development, testing, packaging and integration of
              Micromachined Calorimeters for insertion in Deep Space 1, a NASA technology
              validation program.  Micromachined calorimteres will be used to study the
              effects of the ion engine exhaust plume on passive infrared radiators, used to
              reduce heat from the spacecraft core and from science instruments.  These
              calorimeters offer a significant improvement over conventionally-built
              calorimeters.  ***
