Abstract    :
              9707359  Richard S. Varga      The goal of this proposal is to attack basic
              problems in polynomial and   rational approximation, with varying weights, in
              the complex plane, by means  of potential theoretic techniques. Recently, the
              proposers have begun fruitful  initial investigations in this area, resulting
              in a number of new research   manuscripts, which we consider to be of
              break-through character. We clearly  feel that these initial investigations are
              so promising as to warrant the   submission of this research proposal to the
              National Science Foundation.   But, an important and novel feature of this
              proposal is that connections,  with the efficientsolution of large nonsingular
              systems of linear equations  by iterative methods, are directly associated with
              this theoretical work in   the complex plane by potential theoretic methods.
              Thus, the proposed research  bridges research in complex function theory and
              numerical analysis, and will  have a strong numerical component.      Problems
              arising in large-scale circuit design, oil recovery via petroleum  reservoir
              machanics, and the design of nuclear reactors for generating   electrical
              power, all have the following item in common: the modeling of   these physical
              phenomena leads to massive nonsingular systems of linear   equations, whose
              unknowns can exceed one million. To efficently solve these  systems, iterative
              methods are commonly used. One aim of this proposal is to  use tools, from the
              fields of potential theory anddd complex function theory,  to theoretically
              attack a specific question on how best to iteratively   such large systems of
              equations.
