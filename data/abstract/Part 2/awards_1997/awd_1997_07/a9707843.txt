Abstract    :
              Award Abstract      Fellow:   Raquel-Olguin Jaakkola  Proposal number:  DBI
              9707843    This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research  Fellowship
              for 1997.    This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of
              animal behavior and cognition.  The title of the research  and training plan is
              "An experimental technique for testing  if dolphin whistles are used as names."
               @ottlenose dolphins  produce individually distinctive "signature" whistles. 
              Previous research has assumed that these whistles function  to broadcast
              individual identity; but it has not been tested  whether signature whistles
              actually label individuals, that  is, serve as referential names.  This
              research develops a  technique for testing whether dolphins can identify other 
              individual dolphins on the basis of their signature  whistles.
