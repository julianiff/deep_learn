                    ABSTRACT    PROPOSAL # : DEB-9707556    INVESTIGATOR(S) :  NEPSTAD AND
              DAVIDSON    INSTITUTION: WOODS HOLE RESEARCH CENTER    Severe droughts
              associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO) have been
              common in tropical regions in recent years, and long-term reductions in
              rainfall in the tropics are predicted from many climate models. Up to two
              million km2 of Amazonian forest, representing one-fifth of the world's moist
              tropical forest, depends on annual recharge of deep (>2 m) soil moisture, and
              is therefore susceptible to rainfall reduction. As a result, forests that
              normally extend like firebreaks through the forest-pasture landscape become
              flammable.  The mortality of drought-vulnerable understory and hardwood trees
              leads to a reduction in above-ground biomass.  Soil water depletion also leads
              to a reduction in below-ground production and, hence, in soil respiration and
              soil carbon storage.  In this research, responses to drought of two tropical
              forests with similar rainfall patterns and soils will be compared:  a high
              evergreen forest of eastern Amazonia and a low evergreen forest of the Cerrado
              Region of central Brazil.  The response of these forests to rainfall reduction
              will be compared to the response of the grass-dominated ecosystems that are
              common in both regions.  Rainfall will be reduced experimentally using a
              network of clear, portable panels that intercept incoming rain during the
              rainiest months and transport this water outside of the plots. Canopy phenology
              and stem sapflow, fine fuel characteristics, soil respiration and water
              content, root distribution and tree mortality will be compared for control and
              rainfall-excluded plots.
