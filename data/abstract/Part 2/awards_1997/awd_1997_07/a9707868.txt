Abstract    :
              9707868  SOLTIS     The angiosperms (flowering plants) represent the largest and
              most economically-important assemblage of land plants in the world, there being
              over 300,000 different species.  Diverse angiosperm forms appear in the fossil
              record a little over 100 million years ago, and many additional species appear
              to have arisen rapidly following the origin of the assemblage.  However,
              despite extensive effort, our understanding of relationships among angiosperm
              groups remains far from complete, especially among groups that arose early
              during angiosperm diversification.  The research proposed by Drs. Soltis and
              Soltis will help clarify phylogenetic relationships among major groupings of
              angiosperms, and perhaps more importantly, help identify relationships among
              the most ancient members of the assemblage.  The latter will prove especially
              critical in providing the basis for new interpretations of the patterns and
              rates of diversification.  The work will entail acquisition of DNA sequences
              from three distinct genes (rbcL, 18S rDNA, and atpB) that will be used to infer
              relationships among roughly 400 angiosperm species that were selected as
              representatives of all major groups of angiosperm species.  The work ultimately
              will lead to a new classification of flowering plants that will reflect more
              accurately both historical and genealogical relationships.  The project also
              will lead to new analytical methods for inferring family trees that involve
              extremely large data sets for large groups of species.
