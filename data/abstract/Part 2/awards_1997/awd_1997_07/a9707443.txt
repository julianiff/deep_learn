Abstract    :
                  9707443  Lackmann       The ultimate goal of this project is to gain
              insights into the large-scale atmospheric flow patterns that precede and
              accompany heavy precipitation events (HPE).  HPE's are here defined as those
              events where precipitation exceeds the average 24 hour seasonal rainfall totals
              by two standard deviations.  If characteristic flow patterns associated with
              such events can be identified , new insights about the diabatic heating and
              precipitation processes and feedbacks involved may be obtained.  This
              information, in turn, could serve as the basis for better parameterization of
              the physics in numerical forecast models.   The principal investigator has
              obtained some promising results with a preliminary study of HPE's over western
              Canada.  This study will examine HPE's in the northeastern part of the U.S.,
              principally in the cold season.  His analyses will involve both composite and
              case studies of these events diagnosed from a quasi-geostrophic potential
              vorticity perspective and will examine the role of moisture transports in the
              evolution of HPE's.     This award is part of NSF's Research in Undergraduate
              Institutions activity.  Dr. Lackmann will involve several undergraduates
              directly in his research.
