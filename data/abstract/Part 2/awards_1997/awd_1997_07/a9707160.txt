Abstract    :
              9707160  Khan  Aqueous solutions of galactomannan-based natural polymers  are
              used extensively as hydraulic fracturing fluids to  enhance productivity from
              gas and oil wells.  Chemical or  enzymatic hydrolysis of the galactomannan
              polymers is  necessary to remove the polymer residue and open the  fracture for
              oil or gas flow.  For environmental and  processing reasons, the use of
              hemicellulosic enzymes has  become the preferred route for hydrolysis. 
              However, little  is known about the mechanisms by which these enzymes 
              hydrolyze galactomannans or about the relationship among  biocatalysis,
              physical chemistry, and rheology of these  systems.  The objectives of this
              collaborative study are to  understand the physical chemistry and rheology of
              existing  and proposed polymeric fracturing solutions during enzymatic 
              hydrolysis at high temperatures.  Results are to produce a  new generation of
              stimulation fluids that would increase  accessible oil and gas reserves,
              demonstrate the  technological utility of a new class or thermostable and 
              thermoactive enzymes, and provide a fundamental  understanding of the kinetics
              and mechanism of hydrolysis of  galactomannan solutions and gels.  ***
