Abstract    :
              9707153  Halliday    This award provides partial funding (50%) for improvements
              to the  instrumentation of the Radiogenic Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory 
              housed in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University  of Michigan.
              The University of Michigan is committed to providing  the remaining funds
              necessary. The Radiogenic Isotope Geochemistry  Laboratory is involved in a
              wide range of research requiring modern  geochemical instrumentation including
              studies of the origin of the  solar system, the early differentiation history
              of the Earth, the  accretion history of other planets, the tectonic history of
              the  Grenville Province, and the chemical composition of the Earth's  mantle.
              The improvements to the laboratory's instruments will  include acquisition of a
              direct injection nebulizing system for the  laboratory's plasma-source mass
              spectrometer and an ultraviolet  laser ablation system.  ***
