Abstract    :
                The acquisition of a matrix assisted laser desorption ionization 
              time-of-flight mass spectrometer is supported by the Analytical and  Surface
              Chemistry Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities.  Professor
              Hercules and his students at Vanderbilt  University will use this instrument to
              study problems such as the  characterization of diverse polymer systems, the
              rapid qualitative  and quantitative analysis of thin-layer chromatography
              plates, the  quantitative analysis of FKBP binding proteins to better
              understand  its role in calcium homeostasis, and the detection of aflatoxins.  
              This instrument is central to this research program and it will  replace a
              failing fifteen year old instrument.  A replacement mass spectrometer is being
              purchased with the  capability of doing highly sensitive and selective analysis
              of  complex organic and biological materials.  The materials being  studied
              cover a wide range of polymers and include important  biological compounds such
              as the binding protein FKBP and the  highly toxic aflatoxin B1.  A very broad
              range of applications and  methods of analysis will be developed using this
              instrument.   Important components of this mass spectrometer include matrix 
              assisted laser desorption ionization sample introduction and time-  of-flight
              mass analysis.
