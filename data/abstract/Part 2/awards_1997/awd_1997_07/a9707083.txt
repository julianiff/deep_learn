Abstract    :
              9707083  Goad       The University of Michigan will operate R/V LAURENTIAN 
              during 1997 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of  NSF-funded
              research projects.  The LAURENTIAN is an 80'  general research vessel
              constructed in 1974 and owned by the  University of Michigan.  The ship is
              scheduled for 60  operating days in 1997, of which 35 days are in support of 
              NSF-sponsored programs.  The ship operates primarily in the  Great Lakes.      
              The R/V  LAURENTIAN is a capable vessel for the work  proposed.  The program
              considers the ship important part of  the fleet due to its location.  The
              Laurentian is the only  UNOLS vessel that operates in the Great Lakes, and the 
              University of Michigan should be encouraged to improve usage  of the vessel.   
                 This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National  Science Foundation to
              support oceanographic research  projects.  Most oceanographic research projects
              require  highly specialized equipment and extensive support from the  ship's
              crew.  Oceanographic projects require permanently  installed specialized
              equipment on specially designed  vessels.  This equipment also requires highly
              trained crew  members for maintenance and operation.  The ships do not  operate
              in the same manner as general cargo or fishing  vessels.  Therefore, NSF
              supports the operation of a variety  of vessels specifically dedicated to
              oceanographic research.  These vessels are operated by universities and
              research  institutions around the country.  ***
