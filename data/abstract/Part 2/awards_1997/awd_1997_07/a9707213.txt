Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9707213    Principal Investigator:  Maria Tamargo    Title:
               Improved materials for wide bandgap II-VI visible emitters and devices   
              Analysis:     In this research, the optimization of a class of II-VI materials
              for the design of visible emitters grown on III-V substrates will be
              investigated. The II-VI materials system under investigation is MgZnCdSe and
              the III-V substrate is InP. A strong advantage of the proposed system is the
              good lattice match between the film and the substrate which should result
              increased device lifetime and reliability.  The new research will include
              investigations into (1) an interface termination or "capping" scheme for
              reduction of defects at the interface, (2) Te incorporation for high p-type
              doping and (3) Be incorporation for lattice hardening.    Important
              applications of such systems include blue-green light emitting diodes, and
              laser diodes.
