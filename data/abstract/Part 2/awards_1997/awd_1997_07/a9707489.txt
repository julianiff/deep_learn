Abstract    :
               9707489 Galloway  This RPG proposal requests funds for assisting the PI to
              diversify her interests towards thin film synthesis and analysis of
              scientifically challenging and technologically important microelectronic
              materials.  She will investigate TiN films with respect to potential
              applications in microelectronics.  TiN film growth by Dual Ion Beam
              Sputtering(DIBS) will be used to integrate TiN as a diffusion barrier and
              conductive layer with other materials. The project will be conducted in
              collaboration with researchers at Lucent Technologies. %%% The project
              addresses materials science and engineering research issues in a topical area
              of materials science having high technological relevance.  The research will
              contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to
              important aspects of electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuits. 
              Additionally, the fundamental knowledge and understanding gained from the
              research is expected to contribute to improving the performance of advanced
              devices by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and
              producing improved materials. ***
