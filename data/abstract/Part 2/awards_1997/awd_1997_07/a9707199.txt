Abstract    :
              9530925  Hansell      The PI proposes to purchase shipboard instrumentation  in
              support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be  used abroad the R/V
              Weatherbird II, a general purpose  research ship owned and operated by the
              Bermuda Biological  Station for Research (BBSR), Inc., a Bermuda based United 
              States non-profit research and education institution.  The  proposal
              concentrates on increasing the reliability and  extent of data collection
              capabilities aboard the  Weatherbird II.  Instrumentation includes a relative 
              humidity sensor and precipitation gauge for the ships IMET  system; backup
              dissolved oxygen sensor and pump for the CTD  package, along with an altimeter
              for the rosette; backup  thermosalinograph, remote temperature sensor and
              diaphragm  pump for the underway system; and a dynamic color correction 
              capability for the liquid scintillation counter.  ***
