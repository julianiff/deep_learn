Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematical Sciences at Clemson University will  purchase
              workstations which will be dedicated to the support of research in the
              mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used  for several research
              projects, including in particular:     1. Algorithmic strategies for discrete
              optimization problems    2. Industrial applications of nonlinear dynamical
              systems    3. Modeling of composite materials    4. Simulation in stochastic
              modeling    5.Applications to cryptography
