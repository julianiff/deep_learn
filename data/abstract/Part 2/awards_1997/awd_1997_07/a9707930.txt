Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematicals at Texas A&M University will  purchase a
              high-performance multiprocessor computer which will be dedicated to the support
              of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be usedfor several
              research projects, including in particular: the numerical simulation of flow
              processes; computational algebraic geometry; and inverse problems in partial
              differential equations.
