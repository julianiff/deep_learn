Abstract    :
              ATM-9707535  Saltzman, Eric S.   University of Miami    Title: Extraction and
              Analysis of Methyl Bromide in Greenland Ice  Cores    Polar ice cores represent
              a potential archive for paleo-atmospheric  methyl bromide.  Such data will be
              useful in constraining the  biogeochemical cycle of methyl bromide and in
              understanding its  climatic sensitivity.  Polar ice core measurements will also
              help  explain recent observations regarding the distribution of methyl  bromide
              in air extracted from polar firn.  This project will  consist of the extraction
              of air from shallow and deep Greenland  ice core samples and the development
              techniques for the analysis of  methyl bromide using gas chromatography with
              electron capture  detection and gas chromatography with mass spectrometric
              detection.  Developing historical records of atmospheric methyl bromide over 
              time scales of 102-103 years would lead to new insight in to the  range of
              natural variability in atmospheric methyl bromide  concentrations and its
              relationship to climate change.
