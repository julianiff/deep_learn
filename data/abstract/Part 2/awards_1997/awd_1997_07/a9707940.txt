Abstract    :
              Serra  9707940  The goal of this project is to determine the effect of sequence
              and divalent ions on the stability of RNA.  This project has four specific
              goals: 1) to test the limits of a model for the prediction of RNA hairpin
              stability, 2) to provide the thermodynamics parameters for the prediction of
              RNA bulge loop stability from sequence, 3) to determine the effect of metal
              ions on the stability of RNA secondary structural motifs, and 4) to determine
              the stoichiometry and affinity for metal ion binding to RNA secondary
              structural motifs. RNA oligomers will be prepared by chemical synthesis.  The
              structural stability of the RNA oligomers will be determined by Van't Hoff
              analysis of optical melting curves of the synthetic oligomers.  Interaction of
              metal ions (Mg2+ and Zn2+) with RNA will be determined by observing their
              effect on the thermal stability of RNA oligomers in optical melting studies. 
              The stoichiometry and affinity of the metal ion binding will be determined by
              equilibrium dialysis.    The overall goal of this research is to determine the
              effect of sequence on the structural stability of RNA oligomers and to
              understand the molecular forces responsible for their stability and to provide
              thermodynamic parameters for the prediction of those stabilities.   ***
