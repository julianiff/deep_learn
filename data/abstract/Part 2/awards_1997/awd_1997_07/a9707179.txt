Abstract    :
              9707179  Ramesh       The American Power Conference (APC), sponsored by the 
              Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), is an annual national  forum the
              discussion of the broad overall aspects of generation,  transmission,
              distribution and utilization of power.  APC has  significant educational value
              particularly for undergraduate  students  who aim to learn more about the
              industry with a view  towards deciding their career options.  In recognition of
              this  fact, IIT has been conducting a special program for faculty and  students
              in conjunction with APC.  This program is called the Ben  Elliott Sponsored
              Student Faculty Program (BESSF).  The program  features special breakfast
              sessions and other events for students  (like plant tours) in addition to the
              regular APC sessions.       Through utility sponsorship, the program has been
              successful  in enabling over 120 students and faculty to participate in APC 
              each year.  However, many undergraduate and graduate students are  currently
              unable to attend due to lack of industry sponsors.  The  emerging competitive
              utility environment makes it difficult for  existing sponsors to even maintain
              their current levels of  sponsorship.       In this proposal, we request travel
              funds, for 35 students  to attend APC and participate in the BESSF program for
              the APC-  97. The amount will be cost-shared with funds from utilities and 
              from universities of the students.  The students will be selected  from among
              those enrolled in U.S. universities per the following  criteria:       o
              Undergraduate students, in particular, sophomores and               juniors
              will be given priority.         o Women and under-represented minorities will
              be given first         preference.         o U.S. citizens and permanent
              residents will receive greater         consideration than non-citizens.        
              o Students who have demonstrated prior interest in the power         industry
              either through power engineering courses or                through internships
              will receive additional consid eration.         o Graduate students who intend
              to present papers at APC will         be given preference over other graduate
              students.              This grant will significantly aid the BESSF program in
              its  mission of encouraging more students (especially undergraduates)  to
              pursue careers in power engineering.  ***
