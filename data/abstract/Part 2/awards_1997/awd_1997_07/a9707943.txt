Abstract    :
              9707943  Waguespack  This  research  planning  grant  for  women  scientists 
              and  engineers  entitled Luminescence Studies of a  Novel  Organo  Gel  with  a
               "Stacked" Phenol Microstructure  will  utilize  luminescence  studies  to 
              explore  low  dimensional  energy  transfer pathways exhibited by these gels. 
              Reaction centers  that   are  created  by  doping  the  gel  with  photoactive 
              molecules  such  as 2-naphthol or pyrenol  will  provide  an  opportunity to
              study the luminescent reaction center and any  low  dimensional  energy 
              transfer to  another  intercalated  molecule.  Laser lifetime decay curves will
              be compared  for  the luminescent gels and one dimensional solid crystals.  %%%
               These novel gel systems have wide application in materials  science as
              materials for temperature and moisture sensing.  Furthermore, the highly
              ordered microstructure can be used  to synthesize highly ordered phenolic
              polymers, polymer-  ceramic composites, and semiconducting nanostructures such 
              as quantum plates, wires or dots. ***
