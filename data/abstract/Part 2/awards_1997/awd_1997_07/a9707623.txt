Abstract    :
                    9707623  Lydeard   Charles Lydeard of the University of Alabama and
              Winston Ponder of the Australian Museum will generate a comprehensive molecular
              and morphological database from which to infer relationships among cerithiodean
              snails.  These snails are a fascinating group of about 19 families, 200 living
              genera, and several hundred species.  Cerithioideans are distributed throughout
              the world in a variety of marine and freshwater habitats, including mangrove
              forests, estuaries, seagrass beds, rocky intertidal shores, algal fronds,
              fast-flowing streams and rivers, and quiet lakes.  Cerithioideans are often an
              important component in marine and freshwater communities and play a prominent
              role in the ecosystems they inhabit.  Lydeard and Ponder's central objectives
              are to examine roughly 115,000 base pairs of DNA sequence from mitochondrial
              DNA (including parts or all of the ribosomal (r)RNA genes) and a suite of
              anatomical characters in order to generate a historical, genealogical framework
              that will be employed to address ecological, evolutionary, and other
              hypotheses.  Of primary interest are questions that relate to how such as
              diverse group has adapted to such a wide array of habitats.  Of importance is
              that many gastropod organisms are targeted by Systematics Agenda 2000 as
              understudied creatures.  Lydeard and Ponder's work will provide the first
              comprehensive phylogeny of cerithioideans.
