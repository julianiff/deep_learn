                          for 1997                                                           
                     Review Context Statement and Summary of Panel Deliberations     
              Thirty-one applications were received for the fiscal year  1997 competition in
              which it is expected that 10 fellowships  will be offered.  Two applications
              were determined to be  ineligible and were returned to the applicants as 
              inappropriate.   One application was withdrawn by the  applicant who received
              funding from another Federal agency.    A panel of experts from fields relevant
              to the fields of  biology supported by the Directorate for Biological Sciences 
              was convened for a meeting in Arlington, VA on March 31 and  April 1, 1997. 
              Prior to the meeting panelists had received  copies of all applications and
              written preliminary reviews  on 12 applications.  Each application was reviewed
              by 3  panelists using the review criteria outlined in the program 
              announcement, NSF 94-133.  Panelists were asked to assign a  preliminary rating
              of excellent, very good, or good to each  application.    After reading the
              references, the panelists discussed the  applications individually in random
              order and assigned each  one a final rating as follows:                Final
              Rating         # Applications                                                  
                         Excellent                 7                E/VG                    5
                           Very Good                 9                Good                   
              7        The panel rated your application as excellent/very good.  It  is not
              possible to fund all applications with this rating.  In this application, there
              is an excellent link between the  planned fellowship activities and the
              applicant's career  goals.
