              Abstract  ATM-9707899  Woodcock, Deborah  University of Hawaii    Title: Woods
              from A Tropical Forest Region (Peru) as Climate  Indicators and Development of
              a Preliminary Model for  Reconstructing Climates Based on Fossil Wood    Fossil
              wood has a high potential to yield information about past  climates and may
              prove to be particularly important as a record of  climates in continental
              interiors where few other types of plant  remains are found.  Fossil wood can
              also provide environment  information independent of leaf physiognomy and other
              climate  indicators; and maybe an important source of information about past 
              precipitation variability.  Climate interpretations are hindered,  however, by
              our limited understanding of the way in which climate  affects wood structure. 
              This award supports a project designed to  examine woods from wet and montane
              tropical forest trees and to  construct a database relating climate to wood
              characteristics. The  project will systemize the characters used to describe
              wood,  particularly vessel size and distribution, which have been shown to 
              display climate sensitivity; and compare of woods from  forest/climate types to
              data from elsewhere in the world to  identify those characters most promising
              as climate indicators.   This work will also develop a multivariate model
              expressing the  wood:climate response that will permit detailed reconstruction
              of   quantitative climate estimates to be carried out on fossil wood.
