Abstract    :
              Koester  Columbia University      This workshop will bring together Russian,
              American, German, and Canadian researchers who have been studying the
              environments and cultures of the Kamchatka peninsula on the Russian far east
              coast.  Until 1991 this area was closed to foreign researchers and restricted
              for Soviet citizens.  There has been no organized opportunity for these
              researchers to meet, share results, or plan cooperative projects.  The results
              of the workshop should help avoid redundancy in the research designs being
              planned and executed, lead to enhancement of data gathering and sharing, and
              provide greater opportunity for comparative research.
