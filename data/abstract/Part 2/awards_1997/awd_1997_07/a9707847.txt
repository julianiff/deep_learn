              Award Abstract      Fellow: Cathryn A. Shaw-Reid  Proposal number:  DBI 9707847 
                This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research  Fellowship for 1997.
                 This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of metabolic
              biochemistry.  The title of the research and  training plan is "Biosynthesis
              and resistance mechanisms of  the antibiotic bacitracin."  The goal is to
              elucidate the  mechanisms of biosynthesis and resistance using various  methods
              of enzymology.  Bacitracin is a non-ribosomal cyclic  polypeptide that prevents
              peptidoglycan formation in  bacteria.  A focal point of this study is to define
              the role  of 4'-phosphopantetheine (4'-PP) in the peptidyl-carrier  protein,
              bacitracin synthetase.
