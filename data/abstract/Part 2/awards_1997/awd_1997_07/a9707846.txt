              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research  Fellowship for 1997.  
               This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of  ecological and
              evolutionary physiology.  The title of  the research and training plan is
              "Fluid dynamics and  functional morphology of pectoral fins during swimming in 
              benthic and pelagic sharks."  The classical model of shark  locomotion is
              tested, and pectoral fin function during  swimming is evaluated in sharks. 
              Comparative ecomorphology  of sharks is analyzed using fluid dynamics,
              kinematics, and  motor pattern.  The integration of functional morphology, 
              performance (fluid flow), and ecology (realized niche) is  necessary to
              accurately interpret the ecological role and  evolution of organismal design.
