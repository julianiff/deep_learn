              ATM-9707492  Nishiizumi, Kunihiko  University of California, Berkeley  Title:
              Cosmogenic Radionuclides in the GISP-II Ice Core 10Be, 26Al,  and 36Cl    This
              project is intended to provide a record of cosmogenic  radionuclide
              concentrations in the Greenland summit ice cores as  part of the GISP-II
              program.  The investigators will measure annual  profiles of 10Be and 36Cl in
              the entire 200 m shallow ice core which  spans the time period from the present
              to about 700 years BP.   These measurements will complete the cosmogenic
              nuclide  measurements in the entire 3054 m GISP-II ice core.  Cosmogenic 
              radionuclides in polar ice cores have been used to study long-term  variations
              in several important geophysical variables, including:  solar activity,
              geomagnetic field, atmospheric circulation, snow  accumulation rates, and
              others.  The resulting time series of  nuclide concentrations will be applied
              to three main problem areas:  deducing the history of solar activity, deducing
              the history of  variations in the geomagnetic field, and a detailed comparison
              of  10Be, 36Cl production and the 14C profile.  Cosmogenic radionuclide 
              concentrations will be used to study climate history through the  effects of
              atmospheric circulation and of atmospheric chemistry on  nuclide deposition. 
              The measurements are to be carried out at the  Lawrence Livermore National
              Laboratory (LLNL) accelerator mass  spectrometry (AMS) facility.  This proposed
              work will be undertaken  in coordination with other GISP-II investigators.
