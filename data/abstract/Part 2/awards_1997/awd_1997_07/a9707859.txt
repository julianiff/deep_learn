              George Washington University    Title:  Career Advancement Award: 
              Magnetostatic modes and losses in planar microwave ferrites with inhomogeneous
              magnetization distribution      An extension of the Principal Investigator's
              research in magnetism and magnetic materials to microwave phenomena and
              measurements, and microwave magnetism in monolithic microwave integrated
              circuits (MMICs) will be performed. A key problem in MMICs, the performance of
              the ferrite devices within such circuits as the circuits become smaller in
              size, and as they are required to operate at higher frequencies, will be
              investigated.  It is known but not understood that the performance of the
              ferrite circulator within the MMIC depends very strongly on the ferrite
              thickness.  The Principal Investigator will calculate analytically and
              numerically the magnetostatic modes in the microwave spectra of planar ferrite
              with inhomogeneous magnetization distribution.  The validity of the theoretical
              work will be also checked by measuring the thickness dependence of the
              Ferromagnetic Resonance Spectra of a series of thick single crystal ferrite
              films.  The results will be disseminated through journal publications,
              conference participation and the development of an undergraduate research
              program and revised laboratory course which includes microwave magnetism.
