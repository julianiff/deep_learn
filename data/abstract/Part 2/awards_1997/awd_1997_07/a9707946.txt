Abstract    :
                    9707946 Cutter/ 9714308 Fisher        Collaborative Research: The Chemical
              Speciation of Dissolved and  particulate Selenium in        an Estuary: Effects
              on Trophic Transfer and Biogeochemical Cycling             This proposal was
              submitted in response to the Environmental  Geochemistry and    
              Biogeochemistry (KGB) solicitation, NSF 06-152. It  is being jointly funded by
              the NSF      Division of Ocean Sciences, the  Division of Chemistry and the MPS
              Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities.             The proposed research will
              improve our understanding of the  speciation and trophic transfer of selenium
              in San Francisco Bay.  Estuaries such as this, are complex physical, chemical
              and  biological environments that are not only geochemically crucial  (e.g.
              elemental transfer from the trash water to the marine  environment), but are
              also economically vital (e.g. fisheries,        transportation). The estuarine
              geochemistry of trace elements has  been well studied, but the      linkage
              between the chemical speciation  of these trace elements and their cycling
              throughout the whole  estuarine food web is largely unknown. The combination of
               innovative field and lab studies proposed here will allow  researchers to more
              accurately predict the impact of Se input and        speciation on the entire
              trophic structure of these environments.  Moreover, the methods and approach
              used here for Se should be  applicable to other trace elements and other
              estuarine  environments.     Cuner, OCE-9707946; fisher OCE-9714308
