Abstract    :
                      ABSTRACT      CTS-9707780   AICHE  Dale E. Brooks        The concept of
              the WISE was proposed in 1978 in response to concerns of the engineering
              community that few engineering students have the opportunity to learn about
              public policy, legislative and regulatory processes, and their relationship to
              technological change.    The WISE program is designed to accommodate 15 to 16
              students each summer.  Since 1983 the number of students selected for any given
              summer has depended on the level of support provided by the sponsoring
              engineering societies.  Those provided by the sponsoring engineering societies
              include:  AICHE, ANS, ASAE, ASAE, ASEE, ASHRAE, ASME, ASTM, IEEE, NSPE, ORSA,
              SAE, and SME.    Engineering students entering their last full year of
              engineering make up the eligible students population.  Students are drawn from
              a national pool and the competition is extremely keen.  From these candidates,
              the sponsoring societies have selected 12 students to participate in this
              year's program.    During the 10 week program, WISE interns meet with
              government policy-makers, attend seminars and conventions, and visit agencies
              and corporations to learn how technological issues are legislated.  This year,
              the interns will visit the Office of Technology Assessment, the House Committee
              on Science,  Space and Technology, the National Academy of Sciences, the
              National Science Foundation and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission-to name only
              a few.
