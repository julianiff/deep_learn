Abstract    :
              9707285  Hemminger     This project will explore the fundamental kinetics and
              mechanisms of the reactions of solid sodium chloride and hydrated salts, such
              as calcium chloride and magnesium chloride, with gases such as nitric acid,
              dinitrogen pentoxide, and chlorine nitrate, using surface science techniques
              including x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron microscopy.  Other
              surface spectroscopic techniques, such as high resolution electron energy loss
              spectroscopy and laser-induced desorption mass spectrometry, will also be used
              as warranted during the project. The reactions to be studied are believed to
              contribute to the formation of  hydrochloric acid, nitryl chloride, and
              molecular chlorine, respectively. The latter two are of particular importance
              since their photolysis produces chlorine atoms which may compete with hydroxyl
              radicals in initiating the oxidation of organics in the troposphere. Particular
              emphasis will be placed on studies to elucidate the importance of water on the
              rates of these reactions and on morphological changes in the surface structure
              as the reactions occur.
