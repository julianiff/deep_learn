Abstract    :
              9707568  Lamb    Biogeography addresses the influence of earth history on the
              diversification of life.  Isolation plays a key inceptive role in this
              diversification: groups of organisms separated geographically from others
              assume their own phylogenetic and biological trajectory.  One potential effect
              of long-term geographic isolation is the divergence (origin) of unique species
              that are restricted or endemic to an isolated area (e.g., marsupials in
              Australia).  In this research, Lamb and Bauer will examine the role that
              geologic and climatic events have played in shaping the extensive regional
              endemism observed among lizards in southern Africa.  To assess the influence of
              regional events on lizard diversity, they will utilize more than 2,000 base
              pairs of DNA sequence (sampled from three mitochondrial genes) and a suite of
              morphological characters to construct a genealogical or phylogenetic tree
              (topology) for each of five different lizard genera.  The five different
              topologies will then be compared for similarities (congruence) in overall shape
              in order to identify common patterns and biogeographic factors.  Hypotheses
              that divergence of these lizard taxa are linked to geotectonic episodes and
              paleoclimatic shifts in the early Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene periods will be
              tested.  The research also will provide phylogenetic and classification
              information for several taxa that are poorly known.  Finally, there is
              substantive involvement of undergraduate students in almost every phase of the
              project.
