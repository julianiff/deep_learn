Abstract    :
              The foci of this research are the preparation and characterization of a  
              variety of linear perphenyl acenes and numerous macrocyclic and branched  
              polyphenyl aromatics.  The key steps in the syntheses of the former class   are
              Diels-Alder reactions of polyphenyl arynes and dienes.  Syntheses of   the
              latter compounds will depend heavily on the reactions of aromatic   alkynes and
              polyphenyl arynes with an array of   polyphenylcyclopentadienones.  The ease of
              synthesis, ease of   derivatization, well-defined conformation, great stability
              and excellent   solubility properties make the compounds excellent candidates
              for study   and application.  Applications for use in electrochemical,
              photochemical   and host-guest purposes will be probed.  With this renewal
              award, the   Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Robert
              A.   Pascal of the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University.  Professor 
               Pascal will focus his work on the preparation and characterization of   very
              large polyphenyl aromatic compounds.  These compounds have potential   for
              having great value in electrochemical,  photochemical and host-guest  
              applications.
