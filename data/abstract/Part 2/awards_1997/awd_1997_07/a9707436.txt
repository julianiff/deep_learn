Abstract    :
              The Index Nominum Algarum  is a card file of all the published names of all
              known species of algae.  It includes about 184,000 names and 70,000 literature
              references that have been amassed during the entirety of the career of the PI,
              who is an imminent authority on algal systematics. Currently, this card file
              exists in only a single paper copy.  Having this resource archived in CD-ROM
              format (as images of the cards) will ensure that the resource will not be lost.
               This conversion to CD-ROM will also facilitate further conversion to an
              electronic database that will be of exceptional use to a wide variety of users
              in governmental and non-governmental agencies, research and education.  This
              project is co-funded by NSF and the Biological Resources Division of the USGS
              on behalf of the Integrated Taxonomic Information Service of U.S. government
              agencies.
