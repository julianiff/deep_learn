Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    CTS-9707009  S. Kim  U of Wisc-Madison    The International Union of
              Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) 97-9 Symposium Rheology and
              Computation will be hosted by the University of Sydney, July 20-25, 1997. 
              Participation will be restricted to invited scientists (40 oral presentations,
              and 100 active participants in the Symposium).  The IUTAM Symposia are well
              established venues for presentation of research results and will attract
              participants from many disciplines in engineering and applied science
              departments.    The aim of this conference is to bring together an
              international group of researchers from different fields of rheology.  The five
              themes include:      Suspension Rheology       Boundary Conditions      
              Molecular Dynamics       Computational Methods       Experimental Studies    In
              recent years, there has been dramatic progress in various rheology
              subcommunities, especially with respect to improved efficiency and quality
              control for the benefit of industry.  The goal of the IUTAM conference is to
              strengthen bridges from complementary perspectives and length scales, ranging
              from molecular to macroscopic/continuum levels.
