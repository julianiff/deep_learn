Abstract    :
              9707426  Bridgham    The aims of this research are to investigate interactions
              between plant community composition, whole-ecosystem C budgets, and energy
              balance in northern peatlands.   The central hypothesis of the research is that
              climate forcing of heat loading and water table depth will determine plant
              community and ecosystem structure, which in turn will have a feedback effect on
              the energy budget of the system.  The research plan involves a continuation of
              ongoing research in a unique series of whole-system microcosm experiments that
              include manipulations of temperature and water regimes.  Processes to measured
              include the major carbon, water and energy fluxes, which will be incorporated
              into an ecosystem simulation model.  Understanding the feedbacks and
              interactions among the processes to be studied are a high priority not only in
              the arena of global change but also in the broader arena of
              biodiversity/community structure effects on ecosystem functions.  The site of
              the research is in northern Minnesota.
