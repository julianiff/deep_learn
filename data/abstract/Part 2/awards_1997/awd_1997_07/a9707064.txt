Abstract    :
              9707064  Sakimoto  Lava flows, present on all terrestrial planets, are the
              surface expression of the thermal and chemical evolution of a planet.  However,
              because an active extraterrestrial lava flow has yet to be observed,
              emplacement parameters (such as effusion rate and flow velocity) must be
              inferred from the final flow morphology.  Channelized, or leveed, lava flows
              (flows that solidify only at their margins during emplacement) have relatively
              simple geometries, and thus have been the subject of many numerical models
              attempting to relate eruption and emplacement conditions to final flow
              dimensions.  However, lava is a complex fluid with temperature- and
              strain-rate-dependent behavior, and no extant model accurately describes all
              aspects of the emplacement of channelized lava flows.  In contrast,
              computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations are designed to treat complicated
              fluids such as lava.  By combining CFD simulations of lava flows with results
              from analog experiments using polyethelyne glycol wax to simulate lava, a new
              model will be generated that relates the emplacement dynamics of channelized
              flows with the morphology of the final lava flow form.  Once the CFD simulation
              is shown to accurately reproduce and predict the behavior of simulated lava
              flows, it will be tested on the well-documented 1984 Mauna Loa, Hawaii flow.
