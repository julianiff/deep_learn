Abstract    :
                  9707665  Werren  Wolbachia are a widespread group of intracellular bacteria
              that are found in the reproductive tissues of many invertebrates.  These
              bacteria are "inherited" through the eggs and alter reproduction of their hosts
              in several interesting ways. For example, many strains of Wolbachia cause
              "cytoplasmic incompatibility" an incompatibility between sperm and egg that
              causes destruction of paternal chromosomes and prevents development of the
              embryo. Wolbachia are of special interest because they may accelerate the
              formation of new species, and are of wide interest as potential agents for
              insect pest control and for studying fertilization and early development. 
              Research here focuses on the question "Are Wolbachia involved in reproductive
              isolation between populations and species (i.e. are they a mechanism of
              speciation)?".  The proposed research will address this question in a series of
              laboratory and natural population experiments  By combining studies of natural
              systems and experimental populations, this research should contribute
              significantly to our understanding of the potential role of Wolbachia in
              causing reproductive isolation, and the ability of Wolbachia to move between
              closely related species.
