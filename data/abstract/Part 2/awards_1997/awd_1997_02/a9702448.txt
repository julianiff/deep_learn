Abstract    :
              9702448  Acoff    This CAREER research plan addresses the autogenous 
              weldability of intermetallic compounds using gamma TiAl as  the model material.
               Objectives of the research are:  (1)  Development of fusion welding processes
              for cast and wrought  alloys of intermetallic compounds using autogenous
              welding,  identifying the causes of cracks and voids; (2)  Determination of the
              effects of energy input on the weld  microstructure and the mechanical
              properties (hardness,  fracture toughness, tensile properties); (3)  Simulation
              of  the autogenous fusion zone and heat-affected zone  microstructures using
              computer modeling to predict weld and  heat-affected zone microstructures and
              properties.  The  educational plan of this project complements the research 
              plan outlined above.  Objectives of the proposed educational  plan are:  (1) 
              Enhance the undergraduate materials  curriculum with increased computer
              simulation and modeling;  (2)  Involve undergraduate minority students from
              Stillman  College in research activities; and (3)  Attract minority  students
              to graduate study at the University of Alabama.  %%%  As a class of materials,
              intermetallic compounds and alloys  are of technological interest because they
              are lightweight  and maintain high strengths at elevated temperatures (over 
              1100 C).  One such intermetallic compound, gamma-based  titanium aluminide, has
              been of particular interest because  its properties demonstrate excellent
              potential performance  in aerospace, structural, and high temperature
              applications.  ***
