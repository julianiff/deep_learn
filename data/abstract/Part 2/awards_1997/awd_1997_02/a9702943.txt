Abstract    :
                                      ABSTRACT       The proposed research seeks to develop a
              tomographic technique for nonintrusive heat transfer measurements in 3-D
              unsteady flows in complex geometries.  The technique involves combining
              tomographic reconstruction and holographic interferometry.  Laser beams are
              used to probe the flow field from different directions.  The data is used with
              tomograpahic reconstruction algorithms to obtain the temperature field.  As
              part of the educational plan, CD-ROM based interactive course materials will be
              developed.  The  principal investigator will also introduce opportunities for
              students to gain hands-on experience and engage in collaborative projects with
              industry.
