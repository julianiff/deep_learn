Abstract    :
              9702791  Andino     The project will be conducted as part of  the NSF CAREER
              Program.  The science plan is focused on two areas: 1) gas-phase studies
              (including reaction kinetics and product determinations) of the hydroxyl
              radical reactions with oxygenated organic compounds (e.g., saturated alcohols
              and ethers); and 2) heterogeneous studies of the kinetics of the hydroxyl
              radical with four low molecular weight hydrocarbons (methane, n-butane,
              n-nonane and tert-butyl alcohol) in the presence of  chloride, nitrate, or
              sulfate particles.  This research will utilize a glass-enclosed photochemical
              reaction chamber and a combination of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
              (FTIR) and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) for
              measurements of the chemical reactants and products within the chamber. 
              Complementary ab initio calculations will be performed to identify likely
              reaction pathways.  These gas-phase and the heterogeneous studies will improve
              the accuracy of urban air quality models by providing essential information
              about the photochemistry of oxygen-containing organic compounds and the
              gas-particle effects on reaction kinetics.    For the educational plan, the
              investigator will improve teaching methods for atmospheric chemistry by
              incorporating modeling activities within the classroom setting.  The
              environmental engineering courses the PI plans to develop are centered on
              aspects of problem-solving including: understanding a problem, describing its
              components, proposing a solution(s), and executing the solution. In addition,
              the PI has outlined a recruitment program to attract and retain
              underrepresented students in environmental science and engineering.
