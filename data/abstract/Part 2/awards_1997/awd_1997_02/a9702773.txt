Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    CTS-9702773  John Walz    The effect of surface roughness on the
              interaction forces between colloidal particles and surfaces is a subject of
              great interest.  Surface roughness is frequently given as a possible cause of
              the discrepancy between predicted and measured deposition rates in packed bed
              filtration experiments.  Although numerous roughness models have been
              developed, no direct experimental measurement of the specific effect of
              roughness on the van der Waals or electrostatic interaction forces between
              surfaces has been obtained.    The objectives of this research are to,  (1)
              develop a general theoretical model for predicting the interaction forces
              between rough surfaces in which the mathematical description of the roughness
              is consistent with surface characterizations (e.g., SEM micrographs, AFM
              profiles);  (2)measure experimentally the interaction energy profile between
              well-defined rough surfaces;  and (3) measure the effect of surface roughness
              on the capture rate of particles flowing through a packed bed.  The energy
              profile measurements will be obtained using the optical technique of total
              internal reflection microscopy (TIRM).  Measurement of the effect of roughness
              on both the long range secondary energy minimum as well as the primary energy
              barrier will be made.  The latter experiments are extremely useful since it is
              the height of the primary energy barrier which controls the rate of particle
              deposition in transport through porous media.  The experimental procedure to be
              used will allow measuring specifically the effect of roughness on surface
              forces both with and without hydrodynamic effects.    The educational objective
              is to improve the relationship between Tulane's chemical engineering department
              and the local oil and chemical industry.  Such an improved relationship will, 
              (1) provide better employment opportunities for our students;  (2) provide
              increased financial support for our department;  (3) improve the engineering
              education provided to our students;  and  (4) provide a valuable resource for
              supporting the local chemical engineering community.
