Abstract    :
              This is research is on formal verification and logic synthesis of VLSI designs. 
              In the verification area, heuristics for verification of large, heterogeneous, 
              hierarchical designs, are being explored. These include: property specific
              design  reduction, use of symmetries, coverage directed simulation, and
              hierarchical  verification. In addition, methods to verify gate-level designs
              containing blaak  boxes, i.e. components whose functionality is arbitrary are
              being developed.  In  the synthesis area, methodologies for hardware-software
              codesign and core based  design methodologies are being investigated.
              Appropriate logics for specifying  and modeling components which may contain
              abstract, heterogeneous designs,  embodying asynchrony and complex datatypes
              are being developed. From these  logics, the project is building a theory and
              practice for formal analysis and  synthesis of such designs.
