Abstract    :
              9702217  Morton  Optimization algorithms from linear, nonlinear, and integer
              programming are powerful tools for solving mathematical models of many
              important planning problems.  Strictly deterministic models, however, do not
              capture the uncertainty inherent in many systems, and their "optimal solutions"
              often fail to hedge against model uncertainties.  Stochastic programming
              techniques, on the other hand, explicitly capture uncertainty, but have to date
              suffered from a high degree of computational complexity.  The research plan of
              this CAREER award is directed toward developing and constructing
              computationally tractable algorithms for two approaches to solving stochastic
              programs.  The first approach is based on solving an approximating problem
              generated by randomly sampling a set of scenarios.  The second approach takes
              advantage of the associated special structure within a sequential approximation
              method.  Both approaches will make use of promising variance reduction
              techniques to reduce computational overhead.  In the educational plan, the
              investigator will undertake a number of activities, including facilitating the
              active involvement of students in local industry, developing a new course in
              stochastic optimization, and building a computational operations research
              laboratory.     In the past decade, advances in computing technology have
              prompted renewed interest in developing optimization algorithms that directly
              incorporate uncertainty for a wide range of short- and long-term planning
              problems.  Large-scale stochastic programming models have been used quite
              successfully in such diverse industries as electric and natural gas utilities,
              freight vehicle transportation, manufacturing, structural design, and
              telecommunications.  This work has the potential to significantly advance the
              state-of-the-art in planning models for these fields, and should therefore lead
              to improvements in the delivery of the products and services produced by these
              industries.
