Abstract    :
              This CAREER project develops an adaptive space-time finite  element methodology
              that allows for accurate and efficient  prediction of the dynamic response of
              complex structural acoustic  systems over a broad range of scales and
              frequencies - including  the mid-frequency range. The methods employ finite
              element  discretization of the time domain as well as the usual  discretization
              of the spatial domain. This novel approach to the  modeling of the temporal
              variables allows for the consistent use  of adaptive solution strategies for
              unstructured grids in  both  time and space: a technique which significantly
              improves the  efficiency and reliability of the resulting computational 
              algorithm over standard methods. By orchestrating the  distribution of mesh
              sizes and spectral orders in space-time, a  modeling technique is obtained
              which has significant flexibility  and scope. The educational plan enhances the
              learning process for  both undergraduate and graduate students through a
              comprehensive  array of innovative teaching activities and industrial
              exchanges.  Educational activities include development of a curriculum in 
              finite element analysis, setting up experimental, computational,  and
              multimedia laboratories for graduate and undergraduate  teaching, use of
              symbolic computing systems for innovative  teaching and learning, involving
              undergraduate students in  collaborative research projects, educational
              collaborations with  industry, and outreach activities including delivering
              short  courses and workshops over the Internet via video conferencing  and the
              World Wide Web.
