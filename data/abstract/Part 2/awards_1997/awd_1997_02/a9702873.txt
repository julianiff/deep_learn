Abstract    :
              This CAREER Award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry
              Program supports the research and education plans of Charles R.   Cornman of
              the North Carolina State University.  The goal of the proposed   research is to
              develop metal-based complexes that can mediate biological   signal
              transduction.  An aim is to define the details of vanadate   inhibition of
              protein tyrosine  phosphatases (PTPs), which are components   of signal
              cascades that regulate growth and cell differentiation, and to   use this
              knowledge to prepare vanadium-polypeptides that should act as   inhibitors of
              specific PTPs.       Vanadium complexes will be designed in an attempt to
              control   specific intracellular signals pertaining to cell growth and disease.
               An   introductory chemistry course will be developed that allows for exploring
                shared interests between instructors and students, with electronic  
              communications enhancing this interaction.  In a second educational   project,
              student groups will propose a project to reproduce a published   result with
              real-world constraints of time, cost and instrument   availability.
