Abstract    :
              Research in this project seeks to address issues arising in two computationally
              challenging problems with great economic potential, namely the analysis of
              dental implants and supporting bone structure, and the modeling of complex
              time-dependent 3D viscous flows.  These applications will drive development of
              an integrated problem solving environment that can subsequently be used to
              solve many similar problems.  The overall goal of the research is the
              simultaneous optimization of the computational process with adaptive hp
              discretizations and the use of the most powerful HPC hardware available, namely
              massively parallel distributed memory parallel architectures.  This combination
              of technologies should allow realistic computer simulations of the complex time
              dependent behavior inherent in both of these problems, for the first time. 
              However, this goal needs several advances in the enabling technologies required
              for parallel adaptive methods - data structures, mesh partitioning,
              inter-processor communications, error estimation, adaptive mesh design
              strategies, and fast and stable solvers for adaptive grids in multiprocessor
              environments.
