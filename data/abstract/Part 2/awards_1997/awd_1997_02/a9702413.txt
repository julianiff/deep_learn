Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Proposal Number: CTS-9702413  Principal Investigator: van Zanten   
              This is a CAREER award to study complex fluids such as solutions containing
              surfactants, polymers, colloids or a combination of these components.  Such
              fluids are ubiquitous throughout the chemical and materials processing and
              biotechnology industries. Non-invasive experimental capabilities are necessary
              for flow studies where the shearing force induced by a mechanical rheometer may
              lead to gross structural changes.  Optical techniques offer noninvasive,
              accurate approach to study such materials under biologically and industrially
              relevant conditions.  The goal of this research program is to develop novel,
              state-of-the-art optical methods for characterizing complex fluids in their
              quiescent state.  A key educational component of this research is to train
              undergraduate and graduate chemical engineering students to use such methods
              and apply them to solve engineering problems.  This goal will be met through
              the establishment of a capstone laboratory course for our evolving
              macromolecular science curriculum in which students will be exposed to a wide
              array of experimental tools.
