Abstract    :
              This CAREER award made to James E. Hutchison at the University of Oregon   is
              supported by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division.   The
              goal of the research is to develop new molecular approaches for   optimizing
              the conductivity, processability, nonlinear optical response   and/or
              electrochromism of pi-conjugated conducting polymers.  Two new   classes of
              self-organizing polythiophenes will be studied: (1)   regioregular
              poly-4-alkyl-2,2'-bithiophenes prepared by chemical   polymerization methods,
              and (2) polybithiphene/polypeptide hybrids   prepared by molecular templating.
              Physical studies of these polymer   classes will  determine their extent of
              conjugation, degree of interchain   charge transport, conductivities, band gaps
              and nonlinear optical   responses. The polythiophene/polypeptide hybrid
              polymers provide enhanced   supramolecular order and opportunities to prepare
              discreet molecular   wires of Angstrom-scale diameter which may be useful as
              interconnects   between molecular electronic devices such as transistors,
              molecular   switches or sensors.  The CAREER educational plan will provided
              research and classroom training   to better prepare students to excel in
              multidisciplinary research   environments. Objectives include integrating
              research into the   undergraduate curriculum, promoting peer- and self-learning
              and   instilling a `can-do` problem-solving attitude in all students.  
              Establishment of virtual office hours, and a surface science discussion   group
              will foster collaborations. Faculty-mentored, self-taught courses   will be
              designed to build problem-solving skills.
