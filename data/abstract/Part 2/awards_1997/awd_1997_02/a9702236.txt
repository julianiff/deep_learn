Abstract    :
              In order to shorten product development cycles for integrated circuits and 
              systems, pre-designed cores are widely used as part of the on-chip logic.
              Testing  core-based designs is a major issue because the internal design of the
              core may  not be known if it is intellectual property. In that case standard
              manufacturing  test strategies will not suffice. This research is exploring new
              methodologies  for testing chips with embedded cores. The approach is to find
              methods for  synthesizing the user-defined logic, in which cores reside, so
              that the whole  design meets area, performance and test criteria. Synthesis
              algorithms are being  developed which address the   following concerns:  1.
              Application of test vectors to inputs of the core.  2. Observation of outputs
              from the user-defined logic that drive the inputs of  the core.  3. Testing the
              user-defined logic driven by the outputs of the core.   4. Observation of
              outputs from the core.
