Abstract    :
              Networks of workstations have been proposed for parallel computation, but slow 
              and unpredictable communication has made performance worse than expected.  This
               project is developing a network interface that reduces the cost of sending 
              messages, to guarantee fast, fair, and predictable performance.  The essential 
              idea is to provide a virtual network interface for each user process, with 
              registers for message buffering and with a simplified process to process 
              communication path.  The project is investigating several design issues within 
              such an interface, including efficient user-level access to the interface, lazy
               swapping of interface state, access control, interactions with the operating 
              system kernel, and network fairness.    The educational portion of this project
              updates the computer engineering  curriculum.  At the undergraduate level this
              includes course material on  processor architecture and pipelining.  At the
              graduate level a course in  advanced computer architecture is being developed,
              to span computer architecture  from technological constraints through operating
              systems requirements.  In  addition to course work, students will be involved
              in hands-on digital design.
