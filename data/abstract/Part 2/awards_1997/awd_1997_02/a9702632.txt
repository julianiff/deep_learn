Abstract    :
              9702632  Xiaoxing Xi    The research of this CAREER project studies the
              dielectric  nonlinearity and microwave losses of ferroelectric thin films 
              deposited by Pulsed Laser Deposition.  Compared to bulk single  crystals, the
              nonlinearity of ferroelectric thin films is smaller  and the loss is higher,
              the cause of which is not well  understood.  This project aims to address these
              problems by  focusing on the effects of four factors: (1) Stoichiometry; (2) 
              Crystallinity; (3) Interface layers and space charges; and (4)  Soft-mode
              phonons. The goal of the research is to reveal the  fundamental mechanisms so
              as to reduce the losses while  maintaining a high nonlinearity in ferroelectric
              thin films.  The  education plan is to develop a "Ferroelectric Thin Films" 
              experiment for the Physics undergraduate laboratory course, which  includes
              film deposition, structural and electrical  characterizations and data
              analysis.  %%%   This integrated CAREER research and education project focuses
              on  ferroelectric thin films used in voltage-tunable microwave  devices.  Such
              application requires large dielectric nonlinearity  and low microwave losses in
              ferroelectric thin films.  This  research aims to reveal the fundamental
              mechanisms that determine  these properties in order to improve them thus
              impacting the  development of ferroelectric tunable microwave device 
              technologies.  The education plan attempts to incorporate  research experience
              into the physics undergraduate curriculum.  A  "Ferroelectric Thin Films"
              experiment will be developed and  included in the regular laboratory course so
              that students can  get real-life research experience in this course.  ***
