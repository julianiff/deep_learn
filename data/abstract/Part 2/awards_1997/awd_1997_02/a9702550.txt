Abstract    :
              The emergence of patterns as an organizational and design tool  can help abate
              what Brooks calls the accidental complexity of  software development.  This
              project addresses practical and  pedagogical concerns of the computer science
              and software  engineering communities with an integrated approach to the use, 
              learning, and teaching of patterns.  Work in Design Patterns to  date has
              focused on the recognition, cataloging, and finding of  patterns with little
              attention to the use of patterns by  experienced software practitioners and
              particularly by students  and practitioners not well-versed in object-oriented 
              technologies.  The foundation of the project is the design,  development, and
              delivery of a layered support structure for  design patterns.  The first layer
              focuses on how to use catalogs  of patterns, idioms, and architectures
              accessible to those  without a deep background in object-oriented programming
              and  methodologies.  The second layer builds on this catalog by  developing
              methods for using patterns based on heuristics for  recognizing when specific
              patterns are applicable and relevant.  As part of both layers, the project
              bridges the gap between  novice and expert designers by developing resources to
              aid in the  recognition and discovery of patterns.
