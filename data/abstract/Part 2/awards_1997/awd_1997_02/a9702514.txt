Abstract    :
              9702514  Rappe  This is a CAREER award to a new faculty member.  The  research
              component involves theoretical studies of the  interactions of molecules with
              surfaces.  Because these  interactions are strong, it is important to treat the
               molecule-surface as a single system.  Theoretical models  will be developed
              and applied to increase our understanding  of the electronic, structural and
              vibrational properties of  molecules interacting with metal surfaces.  The
              methodology  to be used will be state-of-the-art quantum mechanical  density
              functional theory.    The educational component of this award involves
              extensive  participation of undergraduates in research projects and the 
              development of distributed research projects for all  undergraduate science
              majors.  %%%  This is a CAREER award to a new faculty member.  The  research
