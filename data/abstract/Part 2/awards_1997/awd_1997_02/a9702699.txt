              ABSTRACT    Proposal Title:   Educational and Research Opportunities in    
              Environmental Engineering: Catalysis as a Tool for      Solving Environmental
              Problems.  Proposal Number:  CTS-9702699  Principal Investigator: Fabio H.
              Ribeiro  Institution:    Worcester Polytechnic Institute    This study will be
              focused on the hydrodechlorination of chlorofluorocarbon compounds on Pd single
              crystal and Pd supported on carbon and other supports. Better understanding of
              these catalytic reactions will impact environmental technologies of remediation
              as well as pollution prevention. The scientific issues are the identification
              of mechanisms of dechlorination and of Pd deactivation, and of the structural
              effects on catalytic activity and selectivity. Among the possible structural
              phenomena, the PI will address organic compound structure effects, metal
              structure sensitivity, support effects, and crystallite size effects. The
              techniques to be used include surface structure and composition analysis under
              UHV conditions (LEED, AES, XPS, TPD), in-situ ultraviolet Raman in a
              high-temperature (500 C) and high-pressure reactor (1.5 atm), and isotopic
              exchange reaction in a separate batch reactor. The restructuring of Pd on
              supports other than C will be studied while addressing in detail the role of
              the support in the reaction. The educational plan includes the strengthening of
              an environmental orientation for WPI chemical engineering students. Projects at
              the junior through graduate levels will involve students studying and solving
              real problems prompted by existing environmental agency regulations or defined
              in accordance with industrial collaborators.
