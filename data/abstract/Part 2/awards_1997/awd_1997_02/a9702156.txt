Abstract    :
              9702156  Taleff    The engineering of economical, enhanced-ductility aluminum 
              alloys requires significant advancements in understanding of  three scientific
              areas, which are the principal research  goals of this grant.  These goals are
              to create a  quantitative, predictive understanding of the following: (1)  the
              effects which ternary solute additions in Al--Mg  materials have on the
              solute-drag creep deformation  mechanism; (2) the nucleation and growth of
              cavities during  solute-drag creep as a function of particulate content and 
              solute chemistry; and (3) the tensile ductility in materials  subjected to
              deformation by solute--drag creep through a  better understanding of the
              mechanisms of necking and  cavitation, which govern ductility.  The CAREER
              educational  activities consist of four fundamental goals, as follows:  (1) a
              unique instructional approach for undergraduates in  the mechanical behavior of
              materials by incorporating  lectures on materials theory with hands-on
              laboratory  activities; (2) unique graduate courses in the mechanical  behavior
              of various classes of materials which utilize  research experience and data as
              educational examples; (3)  incorporation of undergraduate students into
              scientific and  engineering research as a significant enhancement to their 
              educations; and (4) the scientific education of high-school  students through
              association with existing mentoring,  outreach, and University programs.  %%% 
              Success of this research activity is expected to have  significant long-term
              effects in manufacturing.  The  creation of economical, enhanced-ductility
              aluminum alloys  will significantly decrease the price of superplastic  forming
              as a manufacturing alternative.  ***
