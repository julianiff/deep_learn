Abstract    :
              This CAREER award supports research and curriculum activities for applied
              engineering analysis and product development.  More specifically, the grant
              will enable a design environment which reveals the first-order effects that
              drive the design behavior, aiding the engineer to better internalize the
              causality between critical design decisions and a product's performance.  The
              critical activity of the project is the development of analysis and design
              objects that permit automatic application of analytical methods, appropriate
              boundary conditions, and numerical solution to the features of a designed
              component. To develop and demonstrate the methodology, cost and cooling
              analyses are to be developed and applied in the design of injection molded
              parts. The developed methods can later be extended to mechanical assemblies,
              different manufacturing processes, and additional analysis types for
              integration into engineering education and practice.  The research results will
              be translated to academic curricula and industry application through
              integration with commercial design environments.  If the goals are achieved,
              engineers would gain the ability to synthesize designs with real-time feedback
              regarding the product's purpose and performance.  In academia, students could
              gain more thoretical understanding, engineering intuition, and confidence by
              exploring analysis in the context of design synthesis.  In industry, the
              integrated environment should aid engineers develop more robust molded parts
              with reduced time, effort, and cost.
