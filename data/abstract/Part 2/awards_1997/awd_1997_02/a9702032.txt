Abstract    :
              Fitt  9702032         The majority of reef building corals throughout the
              tropics contain  high densities of the symbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium
              sp.commonly  called zooxanthellae. These algae are vital to the health of the 
              individual coral colony as well as major contributors to the overall  primary
              productivity that allows these reefs to flourish in the  oligotrophic waters in
              which they reside. Recent wide spread bleaching  events, correlated to elevated
              water temperatures, have occurred world  wide in which corals have lost their
              zooxanthellae at alarming rates.  While it has been shown that these algae are
              adversely effected by  elevated temperature, the precise mechanisms of the
              cellular events that  lead to a loss in photosynthetic ability have yet to be
              established.         Objectives of this proposal are: (1) to investigate if
              different  types of zooxanthellae in vitro exhibit differential levels of
              damage or  protection to specific polypeptides of photosystem II at the
              biochemical,  translational, and post-transcriptional level, and (2) to
              determine if  similar processes exist for dinoflagellates living in different
              hosts that  reside within habitats with different levels of temperature
              variability.  These mechanisms of damage and protection appear to play a major
              role in  determining the ecological distribution, as well as the ultimate fate
              of  algalinvertebrate assemblages during periods of environmentally relevant 
              stress.
