Abstract    :
              P.I.: Armbrust  Proposal  Number:  97-02158     Institution:  University  of 
              Washington  Title:  CAREER:  Control  of sexual reproduction  in  marine 
              diatoms: a molecular and genetic approach      This  Faculty  Early  Career 
              Development  (CAREER)  project  focuses  on  the  development of molecular
              genetics  in  the  unicellular algae known as diatoms.  Diatoms are one of  the
               most  abundant  groups of aquatic eukaryotic  microorganisms  found in nature,
              with a wide distribution in both marine and  freshwater  habitats.   Due to
              their  dominance  in  oceanic  upwelling zones and in regions over the
              continental shelves,  diatoms  play a critical role both in generating the
              earth's  oxygen  and  in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  The
              research described in this CAREER project is designed to  dissect,  at a
              molecular level, how marine diatoms  perceive  and  respond to environmental
              change.  Environmental  stress  frequently  induces a transition from
              essentially "immortal"  vegetative  growth  to the terminally differentiated 
              sexual  stages.   The  change  in patterns of gene  expression  that 
              accompanies this transition will be identified.  The methods  and  logic  of 
              molecular genetics will also be incorporated  into a graduate course on the use
              of molecular techniques to  address  ecological questions and an undergraduate
              fieldwork  and  research  course.  Additionally,  a  short,  "hands-on" 
              laboratory  course  on  the use of molecular  techniques  to  study  marine 
              organisms will be provided  for  high  school  teachers.
