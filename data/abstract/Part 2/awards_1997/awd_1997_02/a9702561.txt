              Abstract  Proposal: CMS 97-02561  PI:  Linda K. Nozick, Cornell University   
              "Career:  Integration of Education and Research in  Transportation Engineering"
                   This research focuses on the development of more robust  methods to
              optimize the routing and scheduling of hazardous  materials shipments. 
              Analyses with which these decisions  are currently made fail to fully consider
              the multi-  objective nature, the stochastic elements, and the inherent  time
              dependency aspects of this problem.  The research will  develop advancements in
              multi-objective network analysis and  methods to identify the appropriate scope
              of analysis given  the decision situation.    Careers in transportation are
              increasingly systems-oriented,  extend beyond the bounds of traditional civil
              engineering,  focus on opportunities for the inclusion of non-traditional 
              resources to cope with increasing financial and  environmental pressures, and
              involve multiple stakeholders  often with conflicting objectives.  Therefore, 
              transportation professionals are increasingly being asked to  conduct analyses
              which are multi-objective, involve the  evaluation of the inclusion of
              "non-traditional;" resources  and high levels of uncertainly.    For these
              reasons, the teaching activities to be  accomplished here involve the redesign
              of three courses at  the undergraduate level.  At the M.S. level, the
              activities  focus on the creation of two semester, real-world team  design
              projects which incorporate many of these same  elements and ask the students to
              propose creative solutions  which can be realistically implemented based on 
              sophisticated analyses.  The characteristics of hazardous  materials
              transportation decision situations include all the  elements necessary to
              provide an excellent set of homeworks  and projects for both the undergraduate
              level courses and  the master's level projects.      ***
