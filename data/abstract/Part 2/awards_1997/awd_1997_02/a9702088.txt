Abstract    :
              9702088  Margulies  The primary objective of this integrated research and 
              educational plan is to develop research and educational  programs that span the
              interdisciplinary chasm between the  level of the cell and the organ, with an
              emphasis on the  effects of applied physical forces on function and  structure.
                 The research plan is a first step towards the long-term  goals of
              understanding the deformations of the epithelial  lining of the lung in vivo,
              and determining the effects of  these deformations on the lung's adverse
              effects.  Barotrauma, or the presence of extra-alveolar air after  rupture of
              over-distended alveoli, is the consequence of a  sustained mechanical
              ventilation with large tidal volumes.  The overall hypothesis is that the
              alveolar epithelial  lining of the lung is vulnerable to injury from large
              static  and dynamic deformations during mechanical ventilation.  The  research
              plan relates mechanical deformation to disruption  of the epithelial
              surfactant-producing and barrier  properties of the lung using in vitro cell
              culture studies,  mathematical models, and in vivo experimental studies.    The
              long-term goal of the educational component of the  career development plan is
              to create Bioengineering graduate  courses that integrate fundamental
              engineering theories with  biomedical applications.  Three courses will be
              developed:  1) a course in integrated cardiothoracic physiology that  brings
              together basic knowledge and recent research findings  from the molecular,
              cellular and organ levels to correlate  cellular and molecular mechanisms with
              macroscopic  functional responses; 2) a course in viscoelastic tissue  behavior
              and large strain measurement techniques and  analysis; and 3) experimental
              design and analysis, and  scientific responsibility.    The dual mission of the
              integrated research and educational  career development plan is to meet the
              growing need for  research and educational opportunities that cut across 
              disciplines to answer fundamental scientific questions.   ***
