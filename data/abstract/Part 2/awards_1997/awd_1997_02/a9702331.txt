Abstract    :
              A central aspect of a natural language understanding (NLU) system  is  the 
              creation and manipulation of complex symbolic structures  that encode
              grammatical knowledge.  However, equally important is  the   ability  to  weigh
               numeric  influences,  such  as  lexical  frequencies,  that determine the
              preferred interpretation  of  an  ambiguous   utterance.   Traditional 
              approaches  to   NLU   have  emphasized  the symbolic aspects of language,
              while connectionist  models have focused on the numeric aspects.  In this
              research,  a  hybrid connectionist framework is developed that fully integrates
               the  two  types  of  knowledge  within  a  uniform  computational  approach.  
              Within  an  implemented prototype,  symbolic  feature  passing  encodes  the 
              rich grammatical structures  of  a  recent  linguistic theory, while
              competitive numeric processing  captures  the  influences  that  disambiguate
              an utterance.   This  project  involves  a  number of extensions to the model 
              that  necessitate  significant  developments  in  the integration  of  symbolic
               and  numeric processing within a parallel network architecture.  Novel 
              algorithms  are  explored within distributed symbolic  processing  and  the 
              control  of  complex competitive  dynamics,  especially  focusing  on the
              structural and numeric influences of  individual  lexical   information.   The 
              research  also   investigates   the  hypothesis  that accurate numeric
              preference information  can  be  extracted from large text corpora.
