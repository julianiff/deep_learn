Abstract    :
              Schematic heterogeneity arises when information that is represented as data
              under one schema, is represented within the schema in another, for example as
              relation or class names. Schematic heterogeneity is an important class of
              heterogeneity that arises frequently in multimedia databases, semi-structured
              data and in integrating legacy data for data warehousing applications.
              Traditional query languages and view mechanisms are insufficient for
              reconciling and translating data between schematically heterogeneous schemas.
              The goal of this research project is to permit the cooperative use of
              schematically heterogeneous schemas and the data structured under these
              schemas. The project addresses the development of novel languages and
              techniques for: (1) the transformation and integration of schematically
              heterogeneous schemas; (2) the integrated querying of data from schematically
              heterogeneous schemas; and (3) the efficient evaluation of queries over
              integrated views. The techniques are analyzed for efficiency, correctness and
              completeness. In addition, the techniques are implemented within a
              heterogeneous repository of medical data. An evaluation of this implementation
              is used to refine and extend the results. The educational component of this
              project aims to enhance undergraduate and graduate participation in research,
              particularly among women and minority students. This is accomplished through
              curriculum enhancement, expanding undergraduate research opportunities and
              establishing academic enrichment programs for graduate minority students.
