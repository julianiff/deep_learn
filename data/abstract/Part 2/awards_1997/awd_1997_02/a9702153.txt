Abstract    :
              Linda Peteanu of Carnegie-Mellon University is supported by the   Theoretical
              and Computational Chemistry Program to investigate   excited-state
              intramolecular proton transfer reactions in the condensed   phase.  She will
              use Stark spectroscopy to obtain experimental data   regarding the charge
              distributions and structures of molecules that   undergo excited-state
              intramolecular proton transfer.   The dipole   moments and polarizabilities
              that will be measured are critically needed   to model the effects of the
              solvent media on the rates of proton transfer   reactions.    Ideas for
              extending an understanding of spectroscopic techniques into the   classroom and
              teaching laboratory will be implemented.  These include (a)   the design of a
              course in molecular spectroscopy that incorporates   research literature as a
              teaching tool; (b) the integration of   research-based techniques into the
              physical chemistry laboratory; (c) the   incorporation of research-based skills
              in electronics and optics into the   laboratory to increase students'
              understanding of scientific equipment;   and (d) introduction of lasers. 
              Problem-solving skills will be   emphasized.
