Abstract    :
              This CAREER project develops a systematic and unified  methodology for control
              of mechanical and structural systems  such that an integrated design of plant
              parameters and  control parameters is achieved to provide optimized total 
              systems; low-order controllers are obtained to satisfy  hardware and control
              implementation constraints; special  mathematical form of structural system
              models is exploited  to provide simplified design schemes and simpler control 
              laws; saturation constraints and control-loop time-delays  are taken into
              account explicitly in the design process; and  innovative computational
              algorithms using a unified Linear  Matrix Inequality (LMI) based formulation
              are developed. The  education component seeks to address some important 
              challenges in the effective teaching and training of  students and practicing
              engineers in the systems and  controls field today. In particular, the
              education goals of  this career plan are the following: (i) to promote an 
              interdisciplinary systems and controls education at the  university of Houston
              (UH) by fostering cross-departmental  teaching activities, (ii) to contribute
              to the continuing  education of practicing control engineers that are 
              disconnected from the rapid changes and advances in the  field, (iii) to
              provide industry's perspectives in systems  and control education and to
              address real-world problems in  the systems and controls curriculum, and (iv)
              to attract  freshmen students into control engineering and to motivate 
              high-school students towards science and engineering. A  project on control of
              plasma process is used as a  demonstration paradigm for the interdisciplinary
              teaching of  systems and controls at UH. This education project will be 
              pursued in collaboration with the Chemical Engineering  faculty at the Plasma
              Processing Laboratory. Close  collaboration with Cummins Engine Company, Hughes
              Aerospace,  the Payload Integration Company and other companies is  pursued to
              strengthen the industrial relevance of research  and education components of
              this project.
