Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9702327    In this project, a novel strategy for enhancing growth
              rates of solid particulate products of combustion is tested.  The technique
              involves the irradiation of the effluent stream from a dirty combustion system
              by an intense acoustic field; this enhances the aggregation of the soot and
              facilitates its subsequent collection. Also, interesting flame dynamics occur
              when the flame is embedded in the acoustic field.  The coupling of the
              combustion processes to  the acoustics are determined.  Control of flame
              properties by tuning the acoustic field is attempted.  Diagnostic's track soot
              production from the flame through the acoustic field.  Soot morphology is
              determined by sampling and  scattering measurements, impactor measurements
              characterize the soot size distribution, and effects of the acoustic field on
              local flame properties are followed by  flowfield, temperature, and species
              measurements in the flame zone.  Computations complement the experimental work.
                 The benefits of clarifying soot-growth physics are significant.  Most
              practical large-scale burners use turbulent nonpremixed flames which
              potentially produce large amounts of soot, and the impact of reducing the soot
              number concentration from the flame is environmentally significant.  Current
              regulations do not require characterization of particulate size distribution in
              emissions, but recent fundings on health risk factors many change this.
