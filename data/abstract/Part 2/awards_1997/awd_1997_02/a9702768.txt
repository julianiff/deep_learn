Abstract    :
              The realistic deployment of highly articulated robots relies on a  provably  
              complete  sensor  based  planner  for  these   robots.  Consequently,  the
              operation of such robots motivates  the  long-  term  research  effort to
              develop a sensor based  planner  for  a  broad  class of highly articulated
              robots. The research considers  the  next step towards this goal: this approach
              introduces a  new  roadmap structure for an arbitrary shaped object. The
              roadmap  is  termed the hierarchical configuration Voronoi graph (HCVG) and it 
              can  be used to plan a path between two points and to explore and  map  an 
              environment. Furthermore, and perhaps more  importantly,  the  HCVG  applies to
              situations where the robot has no a  priori  information about its environment
              and thus, the robot  must  rely  on  its  sensor  information to achieve  its 
              goal.   A  powerful  feature  of  the HCVG is its incremental construction 
              procedure,  which  is a necessary component of a sensor based planner because 
              there typically is no one vantage point from where the robot  can  ``see'' the
              entire environment; the robot needs to couple sensing  with  motion.  Four key
              aspects of this ppocedure are (1) it uses  only  line of sight distance
              information, (2) it requires minimal  sensor  processing,  (3)  it  need  not 
              explicitly  compute  the  configuration  space of the robot, and (4) it is
              complete.   This  incremental  construction procedure is  general  to  any 
              roadmap  method  and thus provides a framework in how local line of  sight 
              information  can be used to create a global map.  This  award  is  coordinated 
              with  a  companion award from the  Office  of  Naval  Research in support of
              this research.
