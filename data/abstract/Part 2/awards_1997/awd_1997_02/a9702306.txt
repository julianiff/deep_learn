Abstract    :
              This  research investigates optimization methods for constructing  higher-order
              learning machines to solve very large classification  problems  such  as  those
               found in  data  mining  and  character  recognition.    In  higher-order 
              learning  machines,  the  input  vectors  are  mapped nonlinearly into a
              higher-dimensional  space  and  then  a  linear discriminant is constructed in 
              the  higher-  dimensional space. The resulting discriminant function may  be  a
               polynomial, neural  network, radial basis function classifier, or  decision 
              tree.    Vapnik's Statistical Learning Theory  is  used  within  the  problem
              formulation to avoid over-fitting  or  over-  parameterizing  the  
              discriminant  function.    To   solve   the  resulting  minimization problem,
              innovative optimization  methods  are  developed.    This work will have both 
              an  educational  and  research  impact.   The optimization methods  for 
              classification  problems will also be used within computer-based course
              materials  for  teaching concepts of mathematical programming and as a basis 
              for  research  projects for undergraduates.  The research  impact  will   be  
              the   development  of   novel,  fast,  and   accurate  classification  methods 
              based on  statistical  learning  theory.  These   methods   will  be  applied 
              to   very  large   practical  applications  in a diverse set of fields, for
              example:  character  recognition  in  engineering,   cancer  diagnosis   in 
              medicine,  database  marketing  in  business,  and  prediction  of  mortgage 
              prepayment in finance.
