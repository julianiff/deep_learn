Abstract    :
              At a time when our civil infrastructure systems are in dire need of renewal,
              efforts are being made to improve maintenance procedures and condition
              assessment practice.  This Career development plan addresses current issues
              related to infrastructure renewal.  The research work is integrated into a
              research and education program which revolves around topics related
              infrastructure renewal engineering.  As part of the research program,
              performance-based prediction models for bridge deterioration will be developed.
              The prediction models will track component and system parameters (such as
              component capacity and system load rating) as a function of time and will be
              based on the mixed quantitative and qualitative information obtained in the
              field.  By  using case histories developed for individual bridges and isolating
              parameters which relate specific causes to bridge deterioration it will be
              possible to generalize the models to a set of parameters which consider bridge
              type, use, and environmental conditions.  The prediction model will consider
              changes in structural performance due to deterioration and damage.
