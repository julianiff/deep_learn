Abstract    :
              This project aims at the advancement of the ability to extract spatial
              information from digital aerial imagery by taking advantage of geospatial
              databases to support and guide object extraction operations. It deals with
              aerial images representing scenes for which prior or complementary information
              already exists. Examples of such information are pre-existing digital maps,
              digital terrain models, and spatial information systems in general. The
              research plan involves: (1) matching images to existing databases for change
              detection; (2) analysis of scale differences between database information and
              image; and (3) developing metadata structures to convey accuracy information
              for objects contained in geospatial databases. By embedding object extraction
              processes within the framework of spatial information systems, digital image
              analysis will be able to exploit the advantages offered by the availability of
              spatial data from various sources and in diverse formats, and, in turn,
              contribute to the improvement of the temporal and quantitative quality and
              completeness of the data contained in those sources. The educational aspect of
              the project includes initiatives designed to take advantage of and incorporate
              the project research advancements in the graduate and undergraduate curriculum,
              as well as in the high-school outreach program of the Department of Spatial
              Information Engineering. A 3-day workshop, with participation of U.S. and
              international experts is also planned. Combined, the issues addressed in this
              project will substantially advance science in digital image processing and
              analysis, and will complement parallel advancements in a variety of related
              disciplines, most notably digital libraries, geographic information systems,
              and remote sensor technology.
