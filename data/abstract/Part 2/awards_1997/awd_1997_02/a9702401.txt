Abstract    :
              Extraction of structures in volumetric images is an important early task in
              visualization.  Following structure extraction, the structures can be rendered
              for final display for scientists or clinicians.  Dataset registration is also
              important for monitoring change and assessing intervention strategies.  This
              project will focus on visualization of tomographic data, although the methods
              developed are likely to be useful for related problems in other volumetric data
              domains. The project will empirically test the PI's methods on other (non
              medical) volumetric datasets to examine the general utility of the methods.  In
              traditional medical applications, tomographic data has not been thoroughly
              exploited.  A key part of this research is support of more effective
              utilization of volumetric data.  In particular, for medical application, the
              visualization stages addressed in this proposal must be accomplished in near
              real-time to support diagnosis, treatment planning, intervention guidance, and
              treatment assessment.
