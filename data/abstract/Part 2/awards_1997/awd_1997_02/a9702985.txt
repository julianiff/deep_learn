Abstract    :
              9702985  Ross  The research portion this proposal is directed toward an 
              understanding of the cell adhesion process between bacterial  cells and
              collagen extracellular matrices.  The ultimate  goal is to better understand
              the bacterial disease  initiation process.  The PI's hypothesis is that the
              ability  of S. sureus to adhere to collagen under physiological flow 
              conditions is directly related to the number of collagen  receptors on the
              bacteria.  Thus, the number of collagen  receptors will be determined, the cell
              adhesion measured,  and the correlation tested.  The impact of fluid shear on 
              receptor expression will also  be determined.    The educational plan centers
              around increasing the  participation of women in the engineering profession. 
              Academically talented young women will be coached from high  school through
              their undergraduate engineering training.  Research opportunities will be
              developed for juniors and  seniors.  ***
