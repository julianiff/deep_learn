Abstract    :
              Micro-electro-mechanical Systems (MEMS) are miniature electro-mechanical sensor 
              and actuator systems developed from the mature batch-fabricated processes of
              VLSI  technologies.  Advances in MEMS design tools and process technologies
              have  resulted in a growth in MEMS applications.  This research is exploring
              testing  methodologies for systematically addressing issues of MEMS quality,
              and a  comprehensive MEMS testing methodology is being developed.  The approach
              uses  MEMS process simulation to predict the effects that spot contamination
              has on the  physical properties of surface micro-machined sensing devices. 
              Perturbed device  properties are mapped to their corresponding faulty behaviors
              and are used to  classify the likelihood and nature of deviant behavior.  The
              resulting MEMS-based  fault models are used to develop testing strategies,
              design-for testability (DFT)  techniques, and methods for effective defect
              diagnosis.  Also, testing methods  developed for regular CPU circuits, along
              with techniques from analog and mixed  signal testing are being adapted to MEMS
              testing.
