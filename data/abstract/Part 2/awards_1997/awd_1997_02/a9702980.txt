Abstract    :
              The  goal of this research is to investigate the use of  critical-path length to
              accurately predict performance in  several domains, including wide-area
              multithreading,  microprocessor architecture, and high-performance 
              filesystems.  For wide-area multithreading, the strategy is  to develop
              conservative work scheduling algorithms for a  distributed-RAM model of
              computation, and to demonstrate  that the critical-path length can be used to
              predict the  performance of the resulting system.  For microprocessor 
              architecture, the strategy is to gain a fundamental  understanding of the
              average parallelism of ordinary serial  C programs by compiling them into
              dataflow graphs and  measuring their critical-path length. Given that 
              understanding, the effectiveness of hardware mechanisms can  be evaluated. For
              high-performance filesystems, the strategy  is to use critical-path length to
              measure the average  parallelism of a filesystem workload.  The educational 
              component of this project includes teaching how to measure  and achieve
              high-performance using a critical-path length  methodology.  A new course in
              advanced computer architecture  is being developed which will focus on
              microprocessor  performance, and a senior/graduate-level operating  systems
              course will be reoriented to emphasize performance.  Eventually, a course on
              algorithmic parallel computing will  be developed.***
