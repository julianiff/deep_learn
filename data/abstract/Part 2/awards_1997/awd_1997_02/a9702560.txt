Abstract    :
              9702560  Karbhari   This research is aimed at the integrated investigation of
              the effects of interphase formation through fiber sizings and finishes on the
              processing of composite, in particular, in the fabrication of large structural
              components such as in civil infrastructure.  The outcome of this study could
              develop a fundamental science base for advanced microstructural control of
              composites through interphase tailoring.    The activities of  this project
              will be balanced by an education plan to improve the quality of graduate and
              undergraduate education at the University of California-San Diego.
