Abstract    :
              This CAREER Award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry
              Program supports the research and education plans of Patrick J.   Farmer at the
              University of California at Irvine.  The goal of the   proposed research is to
              understand new biomimetic chemistry of myoglobin   (Mb) contained within a film
              on an electrode.  Such Mb-films have   electrocatalytic nitrite and sulfite
              reductase activity.  By using   modified myoglobins, functionally active
              structural models for the   reductases will be studied by electrochemical
              methods.  Aims of the   research include identifying the nature of
              intermediates leading to N-N   and S-S products and to probe oxygen atom
              transfer reactions from reduced   Fe-bound N- and S-oxide intermediates.      
              Modified myoglobins in thin films will be used as models of nitrite   and
              sulfite reductase enzymes.  An undergraduate course aimed at students  
              interested in health-related careers will be developed and a training   program
              for graduate students instituted involving collaborative   research, rotations
              in research laboratories and seminars.
