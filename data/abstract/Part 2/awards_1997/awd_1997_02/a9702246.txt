Abstract    :
              This CAREER Award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry
              Program supports the research and education plans of Karin   Ruhlandt-Senge of
              Syracuse University.  The goal of the proposed research   is to develop
              reliable synthetic routes to organoalkaline-earth   derivatives. Initial
              studies will be directed toward facile routes to   prepare diorgano
              alkaline-earth species and organo alkaline-earth   halides.  Possible
              applications in synthetic inorganic, organic, polymer   and materials chemistry
              will be explored.        The advantages of heavier organoalkaline-earth
              derivatives over   organomagnesium derivatives will be investigated.   Graduate
              students and   students in undergraduate laboratories will be involved in the
              work and   will learn to prepare air-sensitive compounds and handle them by
              Schlenk   and dry-box techniques.  Ruhlandt-Senge has developed a combined  
              laboratory experience involving mentorship between seniors and first year  
              chemistry students in which they prepare and investigate carefully chosen  
              inorganic compounds.  Ruhlandt-Senge is also involved in the Minority   High
              School Student Apprenticeship Program and participates in the   training of
              high school and prospective high school teachers.
