Abstract    :
              This CAREER Award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry
              Program supports the research and education plans of Victoria   J. DeRose at
              Texas A&M University.  The goal of the proposed research is   to use
              paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic techniques to investigate the   roles of
              divalent metal ions in the phosphoryl transfer reactions   performed by RNA and
              DNA polymerases and catalytic RNA molecules.  The   paramagnetic ion, Mn(II),
              will be substituted for Mg(II) so that EPR and   Q-band ENDOR probes can be
              used.        Biophysical studies crossing the boundaries between biological,  
              physical and analytical chemistry will be used to probe basic questions   of
              nucleic acid metabolism and provide interdisciplinary training for   both
              graduate and undergraduate students.  Biological topics will be   integrated
              into undergraduate physical chemistry courses and a   biophysical/biomaterials
              course will be developed for graduate and upper   level undergraduate students.
