Abstract    :
               Microstructure and material properties define the functionality of all
              engineered composites, from advanced fiberglass-epoxy automotive body panels to
              composite biomaterials such as wood, bone, or myelinated axons. For full
              exploitation of these advanced materials, variability of microstructure,
              loading conditions and manufacturing processes must be addressed
              simultaneously. This career plan is focused on development of a set of novel,
              unified predictive tools for improved selection and repair of fibrous
              materials, validated in each focus area with tightly coupled experiments.  A
              new set  of mechanics techniques, referred to collectively as the Fiber Network
              Theory, is used to allow applications of the research to three distinct fields
              of engineering endeavor: power storage; structural design; and human biology.  
              The investigator will develop both undergraduate and graduate curricula and
              integrate them into research activities.  In addition, this CAREER plan will
              explore the teaching techniques and encourage women and minority students to
              participate in engineering and research.
