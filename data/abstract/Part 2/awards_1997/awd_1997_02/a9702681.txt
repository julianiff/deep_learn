Abstract    :
              9702681  Many practical problems such as compile-time analysis of  programs,
              verification of concurrent systems, planning by  intelligent agents, and
              diagnosis of physical systems have  in common the fact that they can be easily
              specified using  logic. However, attempts to execute such specifications  using
              traditional logic programming techniques usually do  not terminate, and are
              thus impractical.  This project seeks  to create a logic programming system
              which can solve such  problems and draws on recent research in tabled and 
              constraint logic programming. Tabled logic programming,  particularly the XSB
              system, terminates for large classes of  programs, and permits reasoning in the
              presence of  inconsistent information through its semantics for default 
              negation. Constraint logic programming allows problems in  theories such as the
              real numbers to be expressed  declaratively and solved automatically. The
              project will  create a unified computational basis for the two paradigms  using
              XSB as a starting point. For certain problems in the  verification of
              concurrent systems and in program analysis,  large programs based on C already
              have been replaced with a  few hundred XSB rules with no loss in efficiency.
              The  project will increase the number of such problems for which  a logic-based
              specification leads to an efficient, practical  system.  ***
