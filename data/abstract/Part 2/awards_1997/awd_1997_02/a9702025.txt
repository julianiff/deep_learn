Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9702025       ANDREAS, EDGAR      COLD REGIONS RESEARCH      AND
              ENVIRONMENTAL LABORATORY       This research project is a key component of a
              large, coordinated, multi-investigator program, Surface Heat Budget of the
              Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean.  The research program will be conducted for 14 months
              from a ship frozen into the ice pack. These investigators will measure
              atmospheric conditions near the surface of the permanent ice cap of the Arctic
              Ocean to determine the flux of heat radiating onto and off of the ice floe.
              They will determine how atmospheric heating is coupled to adsorption of heat by
              the ice. These measurements are critical to understanding how heat is reflected
              or absorbed by the ice as it melts in the summer and thickens in the winter in
              response to seasonal variations in climate. The heat flux measurement program
              makes an essential contribution to the SHEBA team of researchers who will
              measure atmospheric vapiables with a large array of instruments on the ice floe
              and aircraft flying above as well as ice and ocean property measurements made
              on and below the ice floe. The combined set of measurements in SHEBA will allow
              refinement of climate models for the Arctic region. Those improved models will
              lead to better predictions of the climate and the permanence of the Arctic ice
              cap under a proposed global warming that could occur if atmospheric carbon
              dioxide levels are increased above present levels.
