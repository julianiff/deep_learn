Abstract    :
              This award supports an integrated multidisciplinary program of education and 
              research in computer engineering that addresses the real-time computational 
              requirements of multimedia systems.  The approach is based on parallel, fine 
              grain hybrid analog-digital computing, using adaptation inspired by
              neuromorphic  engineering to compensate for inaccuracies in the analog
              implementation.   Research in this program is coordinated with classes,
              projects, and workshops in  the curriculum of the university.  At the graduate
              level, projects will include  focal-plane arrays, speech classifiers, and A/D
              converters.  At the advanced  undergraduate level, classes include experimental
              projects on a smaller scale.
