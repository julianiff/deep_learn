Abstract    :
              9702582  Linden  The Principal Investigators (PIs) propose to fill the need  for
              a more rational approach to optimization of production  conditions for new
              compounds derived from plant cell  cultures.  They plan to exploit evolving
              knowledge of signal-  transduction pathways in plants with experiments using 
              metabolic transport inhibitors, precursors, and signaling  compounds (e.g.
              elicitors and plant hormones).  This  approach is to lead to working models of
              TAXOL synthesis,  release, and degradation in Taxus sp. cell cultures.  The 
              PIs believe the proposed approach should be generalizable to  compounds other
              than TAXOL that are derived from plant cell  cultures, and provide biochemical
              engineers a tool to  achieve rapid production of novel therapeutic compounds
              from  plant cells.  ***
