Abstract    :
              This research is on asynchronous (self-timed) VLSI circuits. High performance 
              design, and testing of self-timed circuits are being investigated. Research 
              focuses on developing tools and methodologies in the following areas. First, a 
              new data transmission scheme for self-timed VLSI systems, the bounded-skew 
              protocol, is being defined. Second, techniques and tools to test self-timed 
              circuits with special emphasis on modeling and testing the actual delays in 
              asynchronous circuits are being developed. Third, methods to reduce power 
              consumption in self-timed circuits by trading concurrency for power and using 
              voltage scaling techniques are being examined. Finally, the potential of 
              asynchronous VLSI design is being demonstrated through implementing prototype 
              VLSI chips in arithmetic and signal processing applications.
