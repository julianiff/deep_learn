Abstract    :
              This work will advance automatic storage allocation through  the use of
              experimental techniques, and will advance  education in experimental computer
              science. Automatic  deallocation of dynamically allocated storage is called 
              "Garbage collection" (GC). GC helps to avoid a variety of  common but serious
              programming errors. Unfortunately, it may  adversely affect program
              performance. Modern collectors  probably provide acceptable performance, but
              there is a lack  of experimental evidence to support this claim, hindering  the
              adoption of GC, despite its advantages.  The goal of  this work is to provide a
              better understanding of GC  performance, both aiding its adoption when
              performance is  adequate, and providing detailed quantitative information 
              about how performance needs to be improved when it is  inadequate. In
              particular, the work will compare the  performance of copying and
              mark-and-sweep collection on  modern computer architectures. The focus of the
              work will be  building a GC testbed, which will facilitate the systematic 
              comparative study of a variety of GC techniques. The  educational goal is to
              improve the teaching of experimental  computer science. A new course is
              proposed that will  explicitly teach experimental CS. The pedagogiaal approach 
              is the standard one used to teach other experimental  sciences, in which
              well-known experiments are repeated,  enabling students to gain hands-on
              experience with the basic  methodologies and techniques.***
