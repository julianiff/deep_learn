              ABSTRACT    Proposal Title:   Synthesis, Characterization and Catalytic
              Evaluation of     Novel Dealumination Zeolite-based Catalysts for the     
              Alkylation of i-Butane with 2-Butene.  Proposal Number:  CTS-9702081  Principal
              Investigator:   Panagiotis Smirniotis  Institution:    Univ. of Cincinnati    
              Dealuminated ZSM-12, a large-pore, one-dimensional, high-silica, 12-member ring
              zeolite, will be studied for the alkylation of i-butane with 2-butene. High
              stability is expected as a consequence of low coking formation, and it is the
              goal of this research to understand the coking mechanism and the zeolite
              features leading to stability.  Dealumination of structurally selected Al will
              be studied as a means to improve anti-coking behavior. For this purpose,
              zeolite L, which contains long channels connecting large cavities, will be
              utilized. Selective dealumination of Al at channel-to-cavity connections will
              be effected by the dimer of 5-bromomethyl-m-phthalic acid produced inside the
              zeolite cavity. The dimerization will be initiated by a suitable radical
              initiator. Characterization of the zeolite will involve X-ray diffraction, 27Al
              NMR to distinguish framework from non-framework Al, SEM, infrared spectroscopy
              of adsorbed bases to determine Bronsted and Lewis acidity, XPS to distinguish
              types of framework Al, ammonia TPD to measure their acidity, and EXAFS to
              investigate Al coordination and location. The removal of Al from channel-cavity
              intersections in zeolite L will be assessed with cyclopentane isomerization.
              The coking mechanism will be studied by gravimetry and by mass spectrometry of
              soluble coke, and the alkylation mechanisms will be studied kinetically. The
              research is significant to the fuel industry and leads to environmentally
              benign processes.
