Abstract    :
              9702897  Marsh  The ability to capture the key dynamics of precision machines is
              critical to the design of precision machines to meet the manufacturing
              challenges of the future.  This Career plan addresses this need by seeking
              means for representing critical machine dynamics reliably and efficiently.  The
              research will begin by capturing analytically the important behavior of several
              classes of machine components such as spindles, bearings and bolted/welded
              connections.  The relevant behavior of each component from the component models
              will then be integrated into the model of the entire machine system and used to
              study chatter avoidance, tool development, and machine design.  The Career plan
              also offers education of engineers capable of accurately modeling and analyzing
              precision machines.  The development of models to represent the key dynamics of
              precision machines is central to the design of precision machines and their
              components to meet tomorrow's manufacturing challenges.  The integrated
              research and education program enables the creation of young engineers
              specializing in machine design for dynamic performance.
