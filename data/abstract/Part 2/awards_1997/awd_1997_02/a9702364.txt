Abstract    :
              Efficient Multilevel Methods for Electromagnetic Finite Element Analysis  Finite
              Element (FE) analysis is very widely used for computer simulation  of
              electromagnetic fields in various electric machines and devices.  Although 
              significant progress has been achieved over the last two  decades, considerable
              computational difficulties remain.  For complex engineering electromagnetic
              problems, three dimensional FE  meshes often have hundreds of thousands of
              elements or more and the  computational time may be prohibitively high.  As a
              result of the  proposed project, the speed of electromagnetic FE analysis will
              be  increased substantially.  This will be achieved by implementing and 
              employing  Multilvel Preconditioners.  The computational accuracy will  be
              significantly improved by using the Fully Adaptive Multigrid  algorithm. 
              Applications of the proposed methodology to magnetic recording problems  will
              be explored.  In particular, efficient FE simulation of  multiparticle systems
              typical for magnetic tapes should  become  possible.  The ultimate goal is to
              make FE modeling considerably more accurate,  fast and practical for
              engineering electromagnetic  problems.  This will  facilitate analysis of
              electric machines, magnetic tapes and recording  heads, and will have important
              implications for nondestructive testing,  optimization, computer aided design,
              rapid prototyping, and in other  areas.
