Abstract    :
              The  award supports research on a collection of projects, all  of  which address
              the problem of individuals or groups learning to be  more  productive  in an
              environment containing other  individuals  and  groups. The gamut of
              multi-agent learning scenarios  covered  ranges from completely cooperative
              groups, where the sole goal of  each   individual  is  to  server  group 
              interests,  to   purely  competitive situations in which individuals learn to
              exploit  the  weaknesses of competitors. On another dimension, the award treats
               both individualistic learning schemes, where each agent learns by  itself, and
              shared learning approaches, where two or more  agents  actively  participate 
              in learning about each  other.  To  enable  shared learning in cooperative
              groups, a group infrastructure  is  necessary.  Work under this award will
              study a group architecture  and  a  flexible commitment framework that allows
              agent  to  make  sensible   decision   about 
              predictability-versus-responsiveness  tradeoffs as necessitated by
              environmental dynamics.
