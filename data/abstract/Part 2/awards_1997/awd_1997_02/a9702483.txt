Abstract    :
              This research involves the creation of a co-processor architecture evaluation 
              environment which integrates architecture-level simulation with industrial CAD 
              tools. The end-goal is to facilitate the design of high-performance 
              domain-specific co-processors. In the evaluation environment, the designer will
               have the capability of 'test driving' a wide variety of design alternatives
              with  respect to real application ppograms. The mechanism is to `drop-in'
              components  into predetermined templates, gauge their effect on virtual machine
              instruction  execution, and use that information to evaluate virtual machine
              instruction  traces. There are three aspects to this research: (i) integrating
              existing or  user-constructed component libraries and synthesis tools into an
              architecture-  level model generator, (ii) integrating the same into an
              interprocessor network  simulator, and (iii) extending an existing
              architecture-level simulator to  include data parallel SPMD architectures. A
              graphic user interface is being  developed to help the user mix-and-match
              components. The resulting environment  will target not only professional
              designers, but also students in computer and  advanced digital design classes.
