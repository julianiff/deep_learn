Abstract    :
              The core of this project is to investigate the design and implementation of a 
              Field-Programmable Mixed analog and digital Array (FPMA) analogous to the
              concept  of a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for implementing various
              mixed-signal  circuits.  An FPMA as an integration of a Field-Programmable
              Analog Array (FPAA),  FPGA, and Reconfigurable Data Converter (RDC) will be
              developed.  An FPMA will  contain: (1) an FPAA that integrates a general
              purpose FPAA and dedicated cells  to realize various sampled-data and
              continuous-time circuits found in mixed-  signal systems, (2) an area-efficient
              FPGA that combines a data-path FPGA and a  bit-level FPGA to realize data-path
              circuits, finite state machines, and random  logic, and (3) an RDC that can be
              configured to realize a number of high accuracy  ADCs and/or DACs with
              different throughputs and resolutions for interfacing  analog and digital
              signals.
