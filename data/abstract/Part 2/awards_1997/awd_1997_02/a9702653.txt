Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9702653  Themis Matsoukas  Penn State    The goal of the proposed
              research is to develop a radio-frequency low-pressure plasma process for the
              deposition of thin polymer films onto the surface of powders suspended in the
              plasma.  Hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon-based coatings with controlled porosity,
              cross-linking and permeability would have a significant impact on a broad range
              of technologies based on particle processing as in powder metallurgy and
              ceramic processing.  With the development of proper coatings, it may be
              possible to improve the flow-characteristics of powders, prevent the
              irreversible agglomeration between particles, provide protection against harsh
              environments and facilitate sintering by reducing the need for binding agents. 
              The advantages of plasma-deposited polymeric films have been long recognized
              and have lead to the development deposition processes on flat substrates. 
              However, film deposition onto powders has not been attempted, largely due to
              the difficulty in exposing powders uniformly to a low-pressure plasma over the
              time necessary for deposition.  Recently, it has been demonstrated that
              particles in plasmas may become electrostatically trapped and remain suspended
              over extended periods of time.  It is then possible to sustain a fluidized
              cloud of fine (micron and submicron) particles in a low-pressure environment
              and expose their surface to the reactive environment for any desired length of
              the time.  In parallel with the experimental part, theoretical and numerical
              studies of the fundamental processes in low-pressure plasmas containing
              particles will be conducted.    The educational plan is focused on the
              undergraduate program and aims at maximizing the educational benefits of
              students in one of the largest chemical engineering programs in the country. 
              Its goals span three specific levels- bridging the gap between engineering
              education and industrial practice; searching for new paradigms in teaching
              beyond the conventional models; and developing speci alty courses from the
              research experience and interests of the PI.
