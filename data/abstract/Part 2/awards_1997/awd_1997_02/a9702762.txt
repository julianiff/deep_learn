              ABSTRACT    Proposal Title:    Molecular Engineering of Catalytic Surface      
              Chemistry Through First-Principles Simulation  Proposal Number:  CTS-9702762 
              Principal Investigator: Matthew Neurock  Institution:    University of
              Virginia, Charlottesville    Density functional theory (DFT), transition state
              theory (TST), and Monte Carlo simulation (MC), are combined to study the
              mechanism of chemical reactions on metal surfaces. In particular, this proposal
              is focused on the synthesis of vinyl acetate on Au-promoted Pd catalyst. The
              reaction is of relevance in the plastics industry. Some fundamental issues,
              such as the effects of surface structure and adsorbed oxygen, are not
              completely understood. This selective oxidation chemistry is analyzed in terms
              of metal cluster structure and composition, adsorbate bonding, oxygen coverage
              and possible pathways. Energetics of adsorption and energy barriers of
              intermediate formation are calculated with DFT, intrinsic kinetics of the many
              possible steps are computed from TST, and macroscopic kinetics are calculated
              from MC simulations. The experimental validation of energetics and kinetics
              involves temperature-programmed desorption at UHV and reaction both at UHV and
              ambient pressure conditions, in work to be carried out by collaborators at
              DuPont. At the educational level, the PI will strengthen the chemical
              engineering curriculum in the area of computational chemistry. Two new courses
              in computational chemistry for undergraduate and graduate students and a course
              in molecular modeling for industry will be developed.
