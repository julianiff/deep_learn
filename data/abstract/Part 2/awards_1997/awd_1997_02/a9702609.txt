Abstract    :
              Magnetic disk drives are expected to increase in capacity  and drop in price at
              a rate of over 50% per year for at  least a decade.  By 2010, a terabyte of
              magnetic disk  storage for personal computers will cost a few hundred  dollars.
              The Personal Terabyte Project is developing a set  of tools for managing and
              exploiting this large personal  data repository.  To guarantee reliability of
              personal  terabyte data, backup techniques including compression,  incremental
              backups, and selective backups of essential data  will be implemented, as will
              disk array redundancy  techniques.  Future homes will have a variety of network
               connections, from high-bandwidth, inexpensive broadcast  connections to
              higher-cost, lower-bandwidth point-to-point  links.  The personal terabyte will
              cache relevant data that  arrives on broadcast networks and aggressively
              prefetch  additional data over point-to-point, on-demand connections.  As data
              are stored on the personal terabyte, the toolkit  will perform automatic
              indexing of text, images and video to  facilitate finding data on the massive
              file system.  To  address the gap between memory and disk access times, the 
              toolkit will prefetch data from disk to main memory.  Finally, to improve
              application performance, the toolkit  will facilitate sharing of the disk cache
              among local and  remote processes.***
