Abstract    :
              9702836  Yau    This project deals with research in complex geometry. More
              specifically, the investigator is to pursue the classification problem for
              Cauchy-Riemann manifolds, the complex Plateau problem, and the problem of
              estimating integral points in tetrahedra.    The problem of estimating the
              number of integer points in tetrahedra has applications in number theory as
              well as algebraic geometry. In particular, such an estimate can be ussed to
              find better primality testing and factoring algorithms. The complex Plateau
              problem is a fundamental problem in complex geometry: it seeks to describe
              those manifolds that can arise as the boundaries of complex domains.
