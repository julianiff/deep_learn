Abstract    :
              HRD-9702034  Howell    Through committed leadership and an innovative use of
              resources, The South Carolina Alliance  for Minority Participation (SCAMP) has
              been effective in increasing the participation of  underrepresented students in
              science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) fields.   An
              underrepresented level of collaboration among Alliance partners has fostered
              the development  of new outcomes that have increased student success as
              demonstrated by the gains in enrollments  and degrees awarded since the
              project's inception.  Support from the business sector, State  Government and
              other strategic partnerships have made SMET education a reality for all 
              students.  Building on foundation of the first phase of NSF funding, SCAMP will
              achieve greater  success through expansion of its programs and activities to
              include greater numbers of  participants.    An increased emphasis on two-year
              transfers and transition to graduate school will be featured  in Phase II.  The
              curriculum reform efforts will be extended to a new target disciplines such as 
              chemistry, physics, and computer science.  Linkages with business and industry
              will be  expanded to sustain success beyond the Phase II funding period.  The
              high level of cost-sharing  in Phase II represents the strong commitment by
              institutional leaders.  New legislation and  policies that call for increased
              accountability for student success and performance will foster  greater
              institutionalization of SCAMP programs and activities and will create new
              opportunities  for involvement from all sectors.
