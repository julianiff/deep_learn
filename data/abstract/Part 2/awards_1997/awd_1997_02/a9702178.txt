Abstract    :
                Because sperm greatly outnumber eggs, evolutionary biologists have long
              thought that sperm competition is the selective mechanism driving the evolution
              of gender differences; males are limited by and compete for mating
              opportunities, while females are not limited by mates and exhibit mate choice. 
              The evidence supporting these ideas come from species with internal
              fertilization or in situation where sperm are deposited on eggs.  However, the
              ancestral, and still widespread, reproductive strategy is to release eggs and
              sperm into the environment where the chance of  fertilization is much reduced
              compared to internal fertilization.  Under these conditions, low densities of 
              males and sperm can limit female reproductive success.  This proposal will
              investigate how sperm and egg traits influence fertilization rates in the
              laboratory and ocean,  how common sperm limitation and sperm competition are in
              natural invertebrate populations and how gamete competition can influence the
              evolution of gender differences in free spawning marine invertebrates.  The
              work will involve laboratory and field experiments, at times using molecular
              techniques to better understand the evolution of mating systems.
