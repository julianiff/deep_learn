Abstract    :
              LIU  9702684    In this CAREER award, the investigator will use a systems
              approach to determine the effect of four major human activities - timber
              harvesting, fuelwood collection, house building, and construction of
              hydroelectric stations - on panda habitat in the Wolong Nature Reserve, China. 
              The PI will 1) assess the spatio-temporal interrelationships of multiple human
              activities; 2) evaluate land cover change and survey vegetation and panda
              habitat conditions along gradients of human activities; and 3) develop a
              spatially explicit landscape simulation model that predicts multi-scale
              interactions and ecological consequences of human activities.  The research
              will provide important insights into understanding the relationship between
              multiple human activities and wildlife habitat dynamics.    The proposed
              research will be tightly integrated with educating future leaders in landscape
              ecology. The trainees will gain international research experience and will
              learn leadership skills by being key members of the organizing committee for
              the 1998 US-IALE Landscape Ecology Conference. The PI will also incorporate the
              research methods and results into three courses so that many students can
              benefit from the research activity. The interrelated research and educational
              activities will help students fully prepare for their professional careers and
              add a significant dimension to their understanding and solution of complex
              global ecological problems.
