Abstract    :
              This research is on developing fundamental ideas and techniques for designing 
              fault-tolerant and highly reliable systems at the register-transfer level. In 
              today's and future technologies failure mechanisms are many, including: 
              manufacturing spot defects, hot electron effects, crosstalk and 
              electro-migration. In this project, the investigator   is exploring techniques
              for design-for-fault-tolerance and design-for-reliability  during the
              register-transfer phase of a system design process. Also being  addressed are
              design methodologies for fault-tolerance enhancement and  reliability
              improvement based on the statistics and physics of the targeted  failures.
              Finally, software tools for the design of fault-tolerant and reliable  VLSI
              systems are being developed and will be incorporated into existing CAD 
              systems.  These research results are being integrated into the curriculum.
