Abstract    :
                9702680  Hallgren         This award provides travel support for graduate
              students,  post-docs, and invited speakers for their attendance at a workshop 
              on time series and their applications to the atmospheric sciences.   The
              workshop will be held in conjunction with the annual meeting of  the American
              Meteorological Society in Long Beach, CA in February  1997.  The workshop is
              designed to bring statisticians and  atmospheric scientists together to
              consider problems of mutual  interest.  The broader goal is to promote stronger
              interaction and  collaboration and exchange of information on new methodologies
               between scientists in the two disciplines.           Support for this award is
              shared by the Statistics and  Probability Program in the Division of
              Mathematical Sciences and  the Climate Dynamics and Large-scale Dynamic
              Meteorology Program in  the Division of Atmospheric Sciences.
