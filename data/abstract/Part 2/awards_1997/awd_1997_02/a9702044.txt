Abstract    :
                The City of Chicago along with nine other large urban cities is conducting a
              national conference to create partnerships between urban community colleges,
              businesses and industry, secondary schools, and government to prepare students
              in urban communities to enter and succeed in the technical workforce.  With the
              increased use of technology by corporate America, industry can no longer accept
              people who lack technical skills.    Urban community colleges and their high
              school partners are uniquely positioned to assume a lead role in preparing the
              workforce necessary for industry to remain productive in urban areas. 
              Partnerships between industry, urban based public schools, and community
              colleges must be established that have as a central purpose the preparation of
              students for technical careers and access of students to other careers which
              depend on use of technical information. The conference is involving city mayor
              s offices, business and industry, the Superintendent of the public schools, and
              Chancellor or President of the community college system in nine major urban
              cities (Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Baltimore, New
              York, St. Louis, and Detroit).  To set an agenda for such a highly visible
              national workshop, a national Steering Committee is taking the lead in planning
              and coordinating the effort.
