Abstract    :
                    9702058  Chang  The goal os this research project is to develop an
              intelligent 3-  Dimension seismic base isolation system aimed at protecting 
              critical  high-tech manufacturing buildings and their contents.  The  building
              contents, which usually are far more valuable than the  building itself,
              consisting of delicate equipment, computers,  chip or disk products, etc.  The
              ratio of the content loads to  the structural dead loads is typically high for
              such high-tech  industrial plants.  These content loads change in magnitude and
               location frequently and usually will cause horizontal and  vertical
              eccentricities which in turn will cause ampliation of  torsion, tilting, and
              rocking responses.  The intelligent  protective systems proposed are designed
              to generate liquid  artificial mass as needed to maintain the fundamental
              natural  frequencies of the isolated building as a constant, and also  produce
              a sound alarm if any isolator is over loaded.  The smart  system can also
              adjust its own properties to fine tune the  isolation system automatically.  If
              the smart system does not  have to be active during a strong earthquake in
              order to function  effectively both for vertical thrust fault prone regions or 
              lateral strike-slip fault prone regions.    An integral, companion educational
              program O.K. consisting of  innovative system design, demonstrations and
              workshops will  capture the interest of young adults, to give undergraduates
              the  opportunity to indulge their academic curiosities, and to prepare 
              graduate students for a productive career in intelligent building  design will
              also be implemented.  ***
