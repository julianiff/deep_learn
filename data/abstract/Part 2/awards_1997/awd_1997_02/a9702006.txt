Abstract    :
              Lionel Goodman of Rutgers University is supported by the Experimental   Physical
              Chemistry Program to continue his theoretical and experimental   studies on
              internal rotation in small nonrigid molecules and aromatics.    He will study
              the effect of flexing of the parent molecule frame on the   internal rotation
              potential surfaces by extending his earlier relaxation   studies to other
              methyl molecules and other rotors.  Two-photon jet   spectroscopy involving
              Rydberg transitions and zero-kinetic energy   photoelectron spectroscopy, in
              collaboration with Mike White of   Brookhaven, will be exploited to yield
              information on the shape and   height of ground state, radical cation and high
              lying Rydberg state   torsional potential barriers.  Electronic structure
              calculations will   also be undertaken using stepwise relaxations to determine
              the key   flexings, and using a number of basis sets involving polarization and
                diffuse functions, and correlation levels.   The torsional motions of methyl
              groups in molecules are presently under   intensive investigation for the
              insight that they provide to the problem   of intramolecular vibrational energy
              redistribution (IVR).  The goal of   controlling chemical reactions by laser
              excitation requires an   understanding of how the excitation energy flows into
              various possible   reaction channels.  Methyl group torsional motions can be
              studied in an   accessible region of the spectrum and offer a one dimensional
              theoretical   model for tracking IVR.
