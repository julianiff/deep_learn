Abstract    :
              ECS-9702320  Braun    Research equipment will be purchased which will allow the
              PI to incorporate semiconducting polymer research and educational activities
              into the undergraduate curriculum at Cal Poly State University.  The research
              and educational activities to be anabled will contribute to the understanding
              necessary to design more efficient polymer Light Emitting Diodes and to enable
              high resolution matrix applications.
