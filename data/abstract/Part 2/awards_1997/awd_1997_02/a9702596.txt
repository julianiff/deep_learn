Abstract    :
              9702596  Bramel  This CAREER award addresses a number of important research and
              educational issues in the analysis of production and distribution systems.  The
              research plan considers two open research areas.  The first is the analysis of
              a general distribution problem, which incorporates multi-product capacitated
              vehicle routing problems, pick-up and delivery problems, vehicle routing
              problems with delivery and back hauls, and general swapping problems.  The
              second is the analysis of certain scheduling and inventory control problems
              that arise in production/distribution problems.  In both thrusts, the approach
              consists of probabilistic analyses of performance bounds for both exact and
              approximate solution algorithms.  The educational plan includes enhancing a
              recently developed  course on service operations management, development of an
              industrial projects course for working business professionals, production of an
              advanced text in logistics and distribution management, and integration of
              software developed as part of the research plan into teaching modules.      
              The management of production and distribution systems is one of the most
              difficult problems faced by managers today.  Many companies have acquired
              model-based decision support systems to assist in the complicated task of 
              developing an effective logistic management strategy.  This research has the
              potential to significantly improve the performance of both the models and the
              algorithms that lie at the core of these decision support systems, and
              ultimately to decrease the total cost of operating a production/distribution
              system.  The educational plan will build on the investigator's efforts to
              integrate research and teaching and will strengthen the level of knowledge of
              quantitative operational methods among the students at the investigator's
              institution and other business schools around the country.
