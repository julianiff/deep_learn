Abstract    :
              9702169  Lynch  Multiaxial constitutive laws that govern ferroelectric  ceramics
              and their implementation as design tools are  developed. Ferroelectric ceramics
              may be applied as sensors  and actuators in industrial applications. These laws
              are  calibrated using the results of experiments on barium  titanate single
              crystals and large grain barium titanate  ceramics. The model are used to
              simulate the behavior of  finer grained barium titanate ceramics and
              experimental  validation of these predictions is done. The model is 
              implemented in a finite element code to obtain a materials  research and
              systems design tool. Laboratory experiments  using ferroelectric materials and
              interactive displays for  tutoring high school students are developed.  ***
