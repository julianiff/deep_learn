Abstract    :
              9702588  Peeples  This Career Proposal describes research and educational  plans
              that will enhance the skills of engineering students  to work on
              interdisciplinary programs at the interface of  engineering and the life
              sciences.  The research area  involves mechanisms of stability used by
              thermophiles to  stabilize proteins and lipids to heat and acidity.  The 
              production of heat shock proteins and the rigidifying of the  membrane lipid
              molecules are two such stabilizing  mechanisms.  The stabilizing mechanism will
              be investigated  by using electron spin resonance on appropriately labeled 
              portions of the membrane molecules.  Once the stabilizing  mechanisms have been
              identified, attempts will be made to  extend these mechanisms to enzymes
              outside of their natural  environments, i.e., for use in biocatalysis. 
              Stabilized  proteoliposomes will be synthesized and tested to determine  their
              stability.  The educational goals will be achieved by  a variety of methods
              including: use of campus resources such  as the interdisciplinary Biocatalysis
              and Bioprocessing  Program; use of group problem and design situations, 
              specific courses, and a mentoring program to increase  diversity and the
              utilization of underrepresented groups.  ***
