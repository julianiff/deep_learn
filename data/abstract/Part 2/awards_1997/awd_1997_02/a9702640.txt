Abstract    :
              This project will  focus on  the development and evaluation  of scheduling and
              run-time optimization techniques for  supporting the parallelization of
              irregular scientific code  with mixed granularity on distributed memory
              machines and  workstation clusters.  The main research topics will be to 
              develop general space/time efficient scheduling techniques  and integrate
              memory and communication support for solving  large-scale irregular problems. 
              A software tool will be  developed for evaluating the effectiveness of the
              proposed  techniques and providing an infrastructure which can be used  by
              other researchers.  Interoperability with other tools  will also be
              investigated if time and funds permit. The  targeted applications will be
              mainly in irregular scientific  computing such as iterative methods for
              nonlinear equations  and sparse matrix based solvers. The educational
              activities  will include course development for undergraduate parallel 
              computing, with an emphasis on parallel programming and  basic scientific
              algorithms on distributed and shared  memory machines.  ***
