Abstract    :
              9702546  Weihs    This CAREER grant explores a relatively new phenomena in 
              nanoscale multilayer materials:  self-propagating,  exothermic reactions. 
              Using  free-standing multilayer foils  that are sputter deposited, the
              velocities and temperatures  of the self-propagating reactions are quantified
              using  optical techniques.  The thermodynamic driving forces are  measured
              using calorimetry techniques, and resulting  microstructures identified using
              electron microscopy and X-  ray diffraction.  The impact of structural and
              physical  parameters on the ignition, velocity, and temperature of the 
              reactions are investigated, and the resulting information  used to develop
              models that aid in understanding the  reactions and in predicting material
              properties.  The  educational program is designed to strengthen  the materials 
              science education infrastructure by developing a national  database for
              classroom demonstrations.  This educational  program provides the design of a
              National Data Base for  Classroom Demonstrations in Materials Science.  The
              database  could be linked to NSF's home page to permit quick access to  ideas,
              instructions, and information for classroom  demonstrations.  It could include
              descriptions, pictures and  videos of exciting new demonstrations in materials
              science.  %%%  Novel exothermic reactions have been demonstrated in thick, 
              free-standing multilayer foils.  They ignite at room  temperatures with a
              simple spark, travel at speeds greater  than 10m/s, and reach temperatures
              above 1500 C.  As free-  standing foils they offer the ability to generate heat
               rapidly and locally, providing new opportunities for joining  materials.  ***
