Abstract    :
              The research part of this CAREER project develops accurate and  efficient
              numerical methods for a number of important problems  including high relative
              accuracy (tiny percentage error)  eigenvalue and singular value computations,
              updating the singular  value decomposition (SVD), and distance problems in
              linear  systems and control computations.    Although current methods for
              solving them are abundant, many  important questions remain unanswered. For
              example, a large  number of recent papers describe numerical methods to compute
              all  eigenvalues and singular values to high relative accuracy for a  few
              isolated special classes of matrices, but a common  explanation and a common
              numerical method are missing. As another  example, the ability to rapidly
              update the SVD is critical in  signal processing applications since problems
              are often real-  time, but none of the current methods is efficient enough for 
              this purpose.    A goal is to provide a common explanation and a common
              numerical  method for high relative accuracy eigenvalue and singular value 
              computations. It turns out that the common explanation and common  numerical
              method are applicable to many new interesting classes  of matrices, arising
              from areas as diverse as combinatorics and  numerical solution of ODE's and
              PDE's. The project also aims at  providing rapid methods for updating the SVD,
              hence removing a  major bottleneck in SVD-based methods for various signal 
              processing applications.    The education part of the project is to develop
              software tools so  that students taking abstract mathematics courses can
              clearly  envision and play with the sometimes abstract objects and results  on
              the World-Wide Web with vivid graphical display. The plan also  includes new
              graduate courses in numerical linear algebra with  scientific and engineering
              applications.
