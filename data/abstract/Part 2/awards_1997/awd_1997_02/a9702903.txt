Abstract    :
              The   award  supports  research  into  Expertise  Networks:   the  technical 
              augmentation of the ad-hoc social  networks  by  which  people  seek
              information, answer questions, and accomplish tasks.  This research undertakes
              case studies of expertise use in current  organizational  setting  in order to
              more  fully  understand  the  social  requirement  in  augmenting  an 
              expertise  network.  The  proposed   research  also  designs,  implements,  and
                evaluates  mechanisms  for finding and storing expertise. A result  of  this 
              research  will be the Ad-Hoc Memory System designed to provide  a  range  of 
              services  to augment expertise networks.  This  system  includes   distributed 
              CSCW  components  such   as   information  distilleries   to  create  expertise
               artifacts   from   informal  interactions,  expertise  beacons  to  signal 
              the  location   of  expertise   agents  to  locate  expertise,  and  user  
              interface  mechanisms to handle the increase in queries. The emphasis is  on 
              finding  new  ways  to  augment people's expertise,  rather  than  automating, 
              and in providing usability through examining  social  requirements.
