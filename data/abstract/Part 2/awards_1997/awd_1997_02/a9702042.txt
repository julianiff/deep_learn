Abstract    :
              This is a special project that proposes to organize and conduct a series of NSF
              support activities at two successive  ACM SIGCSE Symposia (1997 and 1998). 
              This annual gathering of Computer Science educators is the premier of its type
              in that nation, and to which many aspiring awardees gather.  This proposal is
              directed at providing this group with an understanding of the programs and
              processes of DUE within the Foundation, and to provide specific guidance on
              successful proposal preparation.  Prior activities in this area have been
              highly successful resulting in higher quality proposals, and a larger quantity.
               It is an excellent outreach to the Computing community.
