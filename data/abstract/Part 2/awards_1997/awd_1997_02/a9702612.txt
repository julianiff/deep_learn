Abstract    :
              Abstract  Proposal: CMS 97-02612  PI:  Srinivas Peeta, Purdue University   
              "Career:  Efficient and Robust On-Line Control of Large-  Scale Dynamic Traffic
              Systems with Information Systems" "      This research addresses the
              performance optimization and the  efficient on-line robust control of
              large-scale traffic  systems as a substantive example of large-scale man-made 
              dynamic systems with capacity constraints and different  degrees of
              uncertainties in system inputs, in which flows  must be routed on-line from one
              node to another without  complete a priori information on future
              entries/demands to  the system.  The current lack of such accurate and detailed
               real-time data on the state of the traffic system has  precluded a clear
              understanding of the dynamic phenomena  that govern system performance,
              limiting the development of  feasible and effective real-time control
              strategies for  large traffic systems.    This research will use nonlinear
              adaptive and robust control  theory and neural networks to develop a new realm
              of on-line  control strategies that seek the performance optimization of 
              large-scale traffic systems under certain future demands and  network state
              conditions.  The work will involve a blend of  theory, simulation, and
              operational experiments.  Real-time  data obtained from a recently installed
              advanced traffic  management system (ATMS) on a major interstate corridor in 
              an on-going collaborative effort with the Indiana Dept. of  Transportation and
              Hughes Transportation Management Systems  will be used to validate and evaluate
              the proposed models  and algorithms, leading to an enhanced performance 
              efficiency of existing road networks.    The education objectives are to
              systematically bridge the  gap between evolving technological advances in
              information  systems in the transportation arena and their absence from 
              existing curriculum through teaching and experimentation,  specifically in the
              areas of advanced sensor systems, on-  line data extraction and processing
              techniques,  robust on-  line control theory, and high performance
              computational  techniques.  Undergraduate students will be involved with 
              real-time data accessing and processing, and programs  accenting professional
              development and extension course  development are included in the companion
              educational plan.        ***
