Abstract    :
              Sinervo  9702033           Adaptive phenotypic plasticity is fundamentally a 
              developmental phenomenon; expression of developmental pathways is  modified in
              response to environmental cues, generating continuous  trait variation or
              discrete, alternative morphologies.  Understanding the proximate developmental
              basis of such plasticity  can reveal much about the general role of development
              in  evolution.         Experimental manipulation of four species of spadefoot
              toad  tadpoles will be used to investigate the proximate developmental  basis
              underlying the production of a derived, inducible larval  morphology. When
              typical, omnivorous larvae of some species in  this clade consume prey high in
              thyroid hormone (TH), they may  undergo transition to an adaptive, carnivorous
              tadpole.  Manipulating TH levels in larvae from these species tests  hypotheses
              addressing the role of TH in inducing the alternative  morph. Similar
              manipulations of larvae from species that do not  naturally become carnivorous
              tests hypotheses addressing how  environmental factors (diet high in TH) may
              have perturbed  development in the common ancestor, initiating evolution of the
               fully adapted plastic response seen today in the more derived  species.       
               Such an integrative approach may elucidate how proximate  developmental
              mechanisms influence the route by which novel traits  are produced,
              predisposing the production of certain phenotypes  and influencing the path of
              evolutionary change.
