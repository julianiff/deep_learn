Abstract    :
                    9702715  Bradley  The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award
              focuses on  research and enhanced educational opportunities in extreme 
              rainfall estimation for flood hazard assessment.  Estimation of  the upper
              limits of storm rainfall for design of high hazard  structures is based on the
              probable maximum precipitation (PMP).   Many of the concepts in PMP estimation
              were developed in the  1930's and 40's.  In recent years there have been
              substantive  advances in the observation, understanding, and modeling of 
              convective weather systems.  Research will be carried out to  improve PMP
              estimation using modern meteorological methods.  The  principal objectives of
              the research plan are to: (1) develop  unique climatological information on
              extreme rainstorms in the  central United States, to improve our understanding
              of the  hydrometeorological controls on extreme rainfall, (2) examine 
              fundamental concepts of the PMP approach, including moisture  maximization,
              using mesoscale numerical modeling, (3) develop and  evaluate a probable
              maximum precipitation procedure for major  river drainages in the central
              United States based on  descriptions of the large-scale circulation anomalies
              associated  with extended periods of excessive rainfall.  The objectives of 
              the educational plan are to: (1) integrate the use of remote  sensing
              information from modern weather observing equipment into  graduate and
              undergraduate courses, (2) develop Internet-based  instructional material to
              support education in remote sensing  technologies and hydrometeorological data
              analysis.  ***
