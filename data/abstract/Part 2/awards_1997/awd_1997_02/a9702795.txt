Abstract    :
              CAREER:  Origin and evolution of volatiles in submarine and  subglacial alkalic
              magmas  Jacqueline Eaby Dixon, Principal Investigator, University of  Miami 
              The PI proposes to investigate the origin and evolution of  volatiles in
              alkalic magmas from submarine and subglacial  volcanoes.  The goal is to better
              understand variations in  mantle volatile contents and the role of volatiles in
               controlling eruption dynamics of mafic melts.  Sample suites  include
              tholeiitic and alkalic glasses from Hawaii, the  Southern Australs, and
              subglacial volcanoes in British  Columbia.  Concentrations and isotopic
              analyses of the major  volatile species (H2O and CO2) will be measured using 
              infrared spectroscopy, manometry/mass-spectrometry, and  quantitative image
              analysis.  The education component  includes introducing interdisciplinary
              freshman seminars to  enhance the undergraduate experience; for example,
              combining  volcanology and archeology to study the impact of volcanism  on
              human evolution.  The seminars will be linked to field  trips to key locales
              around the Caribbean and Mexico  (Miami's "back door").  Also the PI will
              collaborate with  Dr. James Hay at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) in 
              a program to increase use of the "web" in earth science  teaching.
