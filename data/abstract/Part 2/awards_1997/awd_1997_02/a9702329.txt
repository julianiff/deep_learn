Abstract    :
              9702329  Mead  In spite of the rapid developments in semiconductor laser
              performance and the expanding role that these devices now play in the
              optoelectronics industry, well defined models describing long term reliability
              and degradation processes continue to lag behind in their developments.  As an
              example, several reports on the reliability of 980nm semiconductor lasers given
              over the past two years cite gradual degradation rates as observed from
              characteristic power-current (PI) curves obtained from long term continuous
              wave (CW) testing.  Most often, the tests are performed at high temperature to
              accelerate the degradation process.  This methodology treats the environmental
              temperature as a global parameter which initiates degradation, and it is
              assumed that an exponential relationship defines the rate at which degradation
              actually occurs.    This research plan describes a rigorous experimental
              approach to development of reliability models for degradation of laser diode
              devices using Raman studies on devices which have been aged in a variety of
              environmental seetings.  The approach is in agreement with a three step
              reliability model criteria designed to produce physics based models of device
              degradation.    The academic plan includes a multifaceted approach that is
              designed to encourage participation of women and underrepresented students. 
              The author has demonstrated a commitment to outreach programming and
              engineering curriculum transformation.  These activities are enhanced through
              implementation of this research.  ***
