              Abstract  ATM-9702607  Jenkins, Gregory  Pennsylvania State University    Title:
              Investigating Climate Variability and Climate Change in West  Africa Using
              Coupled Global Regional Climate Models    The scientific goals of this proposal
              are 1) to investigate the  links between the large scale atmospheric
              circulation, the easterly  waves and the climate variability over west Africa
              using the past  fifteen years of observations and modeling, 2) to test the
              model  simulation sensitivity for convective parameterization, and 3) to  try
              to simulate regional climate under doubled CO2 scenario.  The  educational
              goals are 1) to provide outreach to K-12 students 2) to  develop demonstrations
              and presentation with the help of under  graduate students for presentation to
              high school and college  students, and 3) to encourage under represented groups
              to consider  careers in Atmospheric Science.  This work will enhance our 
              knowledge of West African climate variability and will develop  technical
              expertise especially in under represented groups.
