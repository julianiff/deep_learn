Abstract    :
              9702263  Swenson    Phase diagram models are created for bulk metallic glass 
              forming systems and technologically important metallic glass  -forming systems
              are thermodynamically modeled. The initial  work is on a well-characterized,
              good glass- forming ternary  system, Al-Cu-Zr, and an Al-base amorphous alloy
              system, Al-  Ce-Ni.  Phase diagram information (primarily isotherms and 
              liquidus surfaces) is determined using classical  metallurgical techniques,
              such as isothermal phase diagram  sample preparation, differential thermal
              analysis, and  differential scanning calorimetry.  The constituent binary 
              systems are modeled, followed by the ternary systems.  These  data are used to
              predict the optimum glass- forming  composition regions of the system, and the
              results are  compared with experimental bulk metallic glass samples  fabricated
              by melt spinning or piston forging and data that  in the literature. 
              Differential scanning calorimetry is  used to determine the glass transition
              temperatures of the  amorphous alloys and to measure thermodynamic properties
              of  the glass, such as heat capacity, that may be used to  improve the
              thermodynamic model itself.  A laboratory course  entitled "Applied
              Thermodynamics of Materials" is integrated  with current efforts to bring more
              modern, real world  applications into the classroom.  This course presents a 
              series of laboratory exercises involving the four main  classes of materials: 
              metals, ceramics, electronic  materials, and polymers.  %%%  The thermodynamic
              models that will be developed in the grant  can be used to optimize the glass
              formability of metallic  systems, as well as to derive more quantitative rules
              for  creating improved glass forming alloys.  ***
