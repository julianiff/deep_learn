Abstract    :
              9702079  Torczon  This project will set up, advertise, and award support for 
              around 19 selected faculty members to attend the Programming  Language Design
              and Implementation conference (PLDI'97) in  Las Vegas, June 15-18, 1997. In
              addition, SIGPLAN will  sponsor an educational tutorial track and waive the
              tutorial  fees and conference registration fees for the selected  participants.
              The topics of the tutorials are chosen to  improve the effectiveness of faculty
              members teaching  undergraduate courses in the area of programming and 
              programming languages. The selection will be based on a  competitive process
              with several criteria, the most  significant being that the person be a
              teaching faculty  member at an undergraduate institution with a large minority 
              enrollment or a women's college. They will also be asked to  demonstrate that
              they lack independent institutional support  to attend without such funding.
              This activity follows the  lines of similar activities sponsored for PLDI in
              1994 and  1996. It is expected that this opportunity for faculty  directly
              involved in the teaching of undergraduate minority  and women students will
              assist these students in entering  successful careers in computer or related
              sciences.  ***
