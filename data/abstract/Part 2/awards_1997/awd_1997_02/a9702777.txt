Abstract    :
              This   research   investigates  the  use  of  disparate   sensing  modalities 
              within  intelligent  microassembly  systems.  Various  microforce  sensing 
              technologies are  being  experimentally  and  theoretically   investigated, 
              and   a   framework   for   sensor  assimilation  is being developed. The
              assimilation  framework  is  based on a real-time task representation that
              incorporates sensor  models  as  an  integral component of the task 
              description.  The  result  is  an  intelligent microassembly system that 
              seamlessly  assimilates  disparate  sensing  modalities  throughout   complex 
              microassembly  tasks. Based on results obtained  with  microforce  sensing, 
              the  project also develops and fabricates  instrumented  microgrippers for
              intelligent microparts handling. This  research  will aid in the development of
              complex hybrid MEMS devices in two  ways;  by  enabling  the  microassembly  of
               more  complex   MEMS  prototypes; and in the development of automatic assembly
              machines  for  assembling  and packaging future MEMS devices  that  require 
              increasingly   complex   assembly  strategies.   An   educational  component 
              of  the  project builds on the research  component  in  three  ways;  in 
              modifying traditional engineering  courses;  in  developing  new  courses  that
              stress  interdisciplinary  problem  approaches; and in collaborating with a
              local manufacturing  firm  in  order  to  develop  short courses in  advanced 
              manufacturing  technologies for practising engineers.
