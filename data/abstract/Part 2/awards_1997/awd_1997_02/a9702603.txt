Abstract    :
              9702603  Torrents  This is an award to provide support for research, the primary
               objective of which is to obtain a better understanding than now  exists of how
              immobilized enzymes can be utilized most  efficiently in detoxifying wastes
              that contain organic phosphates  of pollutional significance.  The investigator
              plans on screening  a series of protein immobilization supports with differing 
              degrees of surface activation characteristics to identify those  with a large
              capacity for adsorption of the enzymes and then  altering the enzyme to obtain
              maximum linkage between it and its  support.  A secondary objective of this
              project is to identify  the conditions under which the enzymes can maintain
              their  potential for activity when exposed to adverse environmental 
              conditions.    Results of this project are expected to provide insights into
              the  engineering design of processes to detoxify substance of  pollutional
              significance by use of immobilized enzymes.  The  proposal leading to this
              award was submitted in response to NSF  96-115, "Faculty Early Career
              Development (CAREER) Program."  As  such, this award also provides support for
              the continuation of  this investigator's early development as an educator.  Her
               education plan includes development of new courses that emphasize  the
              multidisciplinary perspectives that are inherent to the  practice of
              environmental engineering.  Her innovative approach  also is targeted toward
              leading students to, in effect, assist in  teaching themselves.  ***
