Abstract    :
              9702285  Sitaraman   Advances in medical care have generated a growing market
              for advanced microelectronics assemblies. Currently, the most demanding
              electronics packaging products for medical use are implantable cardiac
              defibrillators and pacemakers.  These products  necessitate a highly reliable
              electronics devices with guaranteed performance.  This research project aims to
              develop comprehensive thermo-mechanical reliability models that would take into
              consideration the fabrication and assembly processes of microelectronics
              devices.  The outcomes of this study could yield a new generation smaller-size
              and lower-weight cardiac defibrillators without compromising reliability.   The
              research activities will be balanced by an education plan to improve quality of
              graduate and undergraduate education at Georgia Institute of Technology. This
              award will support multidisciplinary research and education activities for
              faculty in their early academic career years.
