Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT       The proposed research is to study laser-liquid interactions
              that are relevant to a wide range of applications, including manufacturing,
              materials processing, diagnostics, and biological systems.  Specific topics of
              investigations are laser processing using non-classical heating mechanisms and
              laser-based temperature and concentration measurement and mapping.  The
              research ideas are considered to be novel.  The PI has arranged international
              collaborators with a leading Japanese researcher.  Strong potential industrial
              support is evident.  The PI's plan on education have activities that involve
              high school students, undergraduates, graduates, and teachers themselves.  The
              idea of mentoring Westinghouse contest students is noted.  The PI will also
              emphasize the transition from student to researcher/professor for graduate
              students.
