Abstract    :
              The  goal  of  this research is to develop  algorithms  that  simultaneously
              separate, localize, and track multiple moving  acoustic  sources.  Most human
              beings have  the  ability  to  close  their  eyes while in a room with a half
              dozen  people  talking and separate out the various strands of conversation 
              while physically localizing the speakers.  This is something  computers cannot
              yet do: it is easy to scatter a half  dozen  microphones  about  a  table
              around which  many  people  are  speaking,  but  standard algorithms cannot use
               the  signals  from those microphones to separate, localize, and track  the 
              speakers.   This project is exploring algorithms to  perform  simultaneous 
              acoustic source separation, localization,  and  deconvolution,   using  
              modular  architectures.   Different  modules encapsulate different pieces of
              knowledge: what  the  acoustics  of  a room can do to a sound, what  human 
              speech  sounds like, what it means for sources to be separated,  how  sources 
              tend  to  move about in space.   The  knowledge  is  combined  in probabilistic
              framework, yielding estimates  of  the  separated  source  waveforms  and 
              physical  locations.  These algorithms have the potential to improve devices 
              like  speaker   phones,  cellular  telephones,  stereos,  computer  speech 
              recognition  systems, burglar  alarms,  and  hearing  aids.
