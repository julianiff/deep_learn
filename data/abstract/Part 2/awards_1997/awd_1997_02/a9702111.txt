Abstract    :
              This is a five year study for the development of a dependability evaluation 
              framework and the tools for evaluating the dependability of computer systems.  
              Tools being developed as part of this project include a portable dependability 
              measurement tool to identify failure modes in Unix and Windows NT, a cyclotron-
               based transient fault injector, and a transient emulator that uses field- 
              programmable gate arrays for fault simulation.  Education plans include the 
              development of courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level that 
              introduce design and analysis for dependability.  Also an interactive
              laboratory  for student access to dependability analysis tools will be
              developed.
