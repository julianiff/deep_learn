Abstract    :
              Professor Snapper's research focuses on synthetic and mechanistic studies   of
              metal catalyzed alkylidene metathesis reactions.  The scope of the  
              ring-opening cross metathesis of strained cycloalkenes will be examined,   and
              both improvement of the stereoselectivity of this process and   development of
              enantioselective cross metathesis reactions will be   explored.  Asymmetric
              syntheses using substrate control, by means of   chiral tetraenes, and reagent
              control, through use of chiral Ru   complexes, will be examined.  A
              conceptually related photo/thermal   (2+2)/retro(2+2) cyclization pathway will
              also be investigated.    Professor Snapper will develop an undergraduate
              research course, assemble   outreach programs that will provide chemistry
              demonstrations and   laboratory equipment to local schools, and initiate a
              program designed to   improve the teaching, speaking, writing, and
              organizational skills of   graduate students.  With this CAREER award, the
              Synthetic Organic Program supports the   research and educational activities of
              Professor Marc L. Snapper of the   Department of Chemistry at Boston College. 
              Professor Snapper's research   is directed toward the use of a metal catalyzed
              reaction of compounds   containing carbon-carbon double bonds, the so-called
              olefin metathesis   reaction, to effect the formation of various types of
              organic products.    By variation of the specific structures used in this
              reaction, Professor   Snapper is able to prepare compounds which may serve as
              convenient   starting points for the synthesis of more complex molecules of
              relevance   to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.  Professor
              Snapper's   educational activities involve enhancing the research experiences
              of   undergraduates, facilitating the interest of high school students in  
              chemistry through outreach programs, and improving the teaching and  
              communication skills of graduate students.
