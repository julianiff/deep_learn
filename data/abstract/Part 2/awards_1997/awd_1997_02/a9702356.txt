Abstract    :
              9702356  Yiacoumi  This is an award to provide support for research on obtaining
              a  better understanding than now exists of the influence of sorption  rates on
              the surface charge and flocculation rates of colloidal  particles suspended in
              water.  This investigator's research  involves experimental studies to assist
              in development of  mathematical models that can be used to predict the behavior
              of  particles derived from weathering processes in colloidal aqueous 
              suspension and particles formed during water and wastewater  treatment
              processes.  The proposal leading to this award was  submitted in response to
              NSF 96-115, "Faculty Early Career  Development (CAREER) Program."  As such,
              this award also provides  support for the continuation of this investigator's
              early  development as an educator.  Her education plan involves  developing new
              courses that emphasize mathematical modeling of  environmental systems,
              incorporation of research results into  courses, short courses for industrial
              researchers and  practitioners and student participation in experimental work
              at a  National Laboratory.    Results of this project are expected to provide
              insights into  sources and behavior of particles in natural waters.  The 
              mathematical models that result from this research may find use  in engineering
              design of processes to remove particles from  suspension in water, treatment of
              wastewater prior to discharge  to the environment and in processes for
              deliberate manufacture of  particles.  ***
