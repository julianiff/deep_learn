Abstract    :
              Scott Reid of Marquette University is supported by the Experimental   Physical
              Chemistry Program to investigate (i) the vibrational and   unimolecular
              reaction dynamics of molecular free radicals at chemically   significant
              energies and (ii) the excited electronic state dynamics of   prototypical
              organic free radicals, with a focus on competition between   multiple
              photochemical pathways.  Radiation sources based on seeded   optical parametric
              oscillators will be developed in concert with a   variety of spectroscopic and
              time-resolved methodologies, including   nonlinear spectroscopies based on
              laser-induced gratings (e.g.,   degenerate four-wave mixing) and new linear
              spectroscopies (e.g., cavity   ring-down spectroscopy).    The education phase
              of this CAREER award involves (i) undergraduate   curriculum development, (ii)
              initiatives for promoting research   opportunities for undergraduates and (iii)
              implementation of novel   classroom assessment methodologies.
