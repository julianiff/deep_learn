Abstract    :
              9702361  Smets  This is an award to provide support for research on appropriate 
              use of natural attenuation to develop biologically-based  technologies for
              removal of hazardous substances from soil that  is contaminated with these
              substances.  The research is based on  a hypothesis that the exchange and
              rearrangement of horizontally  transmissible genetic material is a major
              contributor to the  short-term adaptation of existing microbial communities in
              soil  and that characterization of the transfer process in the presence  of
              stress can provide insights that can be applied to engineering  design of
              systems for decontamination of soil.  This award also  provides support for the
              continuation of this investigator's  early development as an educator.  His
              education plan involves  addressing the engineering profession's demands for
              engineers who  couple a significant technical base of knowledge with an ability
               for synthesis and cross-disciplinary integration.    The proposal leading to
              this award was submitted in response to  NSF 96-115, "Faculty Early Career
              Development (CAREER) Program."  Quantitative knowledge of how microbial
              communities adapt to  contaminant stress can assist in the engineering design
              of  systems and procedures to exploit the capability of naturally  occurring
              communities of organisms to removal of contaminants  from soil and contaminated
              aquifers.  ***
