                ABSTRACT    Proposal No:   CTS-9702239   Proposal Type:  CAREER  Principal
              Investigator: J. Karl Johnson  Affiliation:   University of  Pittsburgh      
              This CAREER grant is awarded through the Interfacial, Transport and Separations
              Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The objective of the
              proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of using novel carbon nanotubules
              for advanced hydrogen storage systems. The calculations proposed will answer
              the question of whether carbon nanotubules are better suited for hydrogen
              storage than the best currently available commercial adsorbents. Phase
              diagrams, adsorption and desorption isotherms for hydrogen adsorbed in single
              tubules and in a honeycomb array of tubules, including the effect of adsorption
              in the tubule interstitial regions (where three tubules meet) will be computed.
              The amount of hydrogen adsorbed will be maximized as a function of tubule
              diameter over the range of operational temperatures and pressures.    Hydrogen
              storage could be the first commercial application for carbon nanotubules.
              Possible applications of nanotuble based hydrogen storage systems include
              hydrogen powered vehicles, hydrogen transportation, gas separation, etc. Three
              main educational projects are also identified in the proposal (1) Development
              of web-based interactive instructional modules (2) Internet based learning and
              research for high school students (3) Participation in the Research Experience
              for Undergraduates program.
