Abstract    :
              This project integrates research and education in the design of memory 
              hierarchies.  The research augments conventional cache management techniques
              with  more sophisticated reference history information.  These techniques
              include  programmer-supplied annotations, hardware buffers to identify and
              exploit  locality, use of latency tolerance to decide on invalidation of cache
              lines, and  prefetching of thread working sets.  These research efforts will be
              integrated  into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum by adding courses,
              organizing a  working group on computer architecture, and maintaining a web
              site on memory  hierarchy management.
