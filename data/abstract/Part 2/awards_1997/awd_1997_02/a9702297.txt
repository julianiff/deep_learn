Abstract    :
              Automatic parallelization of object-oriented  computations is becoming
              increasingly important  with the widespread acceptance of object-oriented 
              languages such as Java and C++, and the adoption  of small-scale shared-memory
              multiprocessors as  the mainstay of enterprise computing. A key  problem that
              complicates the automatic  parallelization of object-oriented programs is  the
              pervasive use of irregular linked data  structures such as lists, trees and
              graphs. The  project will investigate a fundamentally new  analysis technique,
              commutativity analysis, that  is designed to automatically parallelize object- 
              oriented computations that manipulate linked data  structures.  The project
              will  focus on practical techniques such as the  generation of self-tuning
              code, or code that  dynamically changes its behavior  to adapt to changes in
              the execution  environment, and optimizations that reduce  synchronization
              overhead. It will also  investigate advanced analyses such as relative 
              commutativity analysis, which enables the  automatic parallelization of
              computations that  build linked  data structures, and replication  analysis,
              which enables the dynamic replication  of objects to eliminate serialization.
              The  overall goal is to develop techniques that  enable a dramatic reduction in
              the cost and  difficulty of developing software for parallel  machines. 
              Educational contributions include  the involvement of students in the research
              and  the development of a new class in program  analysis.***
