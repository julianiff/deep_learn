Abstract    :
               This project focuses on the development of computational manufacturing that
              integrates computational geometry, surface error analysis, machining
              principles, optimization techniques, and computer graphics for multi-axis
              complex surface machining.  The research focus will include the development of
              a robust complex surface geometry interrogation engine and the generation of
              free-form tool paths for removing material from the stock, while avoiding local
              and global interference.  The education focus will include the development of a
              rapid response manufacturing practicum as a core of an undergraduate
              manufacturing engineering curriculum.  A lab will be developed to incorporate
              computational manufacturing and NC complex part machining in the undergraduate
              manufacturing core courses.  An innovative multimedia guide to manufacturing
              processes will be developed for distance learning.   The development of
              computational manufacturing as a new paradigm for generating interference-free,
              multi-axis machining paths directly from a CAD representation of the object
              provides a science based approach for solving complex part machining planning
              problems.  There is a strong synergy between the research and education plans.
