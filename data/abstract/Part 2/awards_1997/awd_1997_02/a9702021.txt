Abstract    :
              9702021    Shah  Description:  The research "Ultrafast Processes in
              Semiconductors,  their Nanostructures and Optoelectronic Devices, Award in US
              and  Indian Currencies" is a new collaboration linking the Tata Institute  of
              Fundamental Research (TIFR)in Bombay with the University of  New Mexico, the
              CNRS Laboratoire de Microstructures et de  Microelectronique in France, and
              Bell Laboratories, New Jersey.   This research in ultrafast optoelectronics
              developed from an earlier  collaboration (INT-9022623) between PI Shah and
              co-PI Arora of  TIFR that established the first and only picosecond
              spectroscopy  laboratory in India.  The scientific focus is: (1) energy
              relaxation  processes and rates in low-dimensional semiconductors and the 
              effect of relaxation dynamics on the performance of optoelectronic  devices
              fabricated from such structures; (2) development of  fabrication and
              characterization techniques for photoconducting  switches and electro-optic
              samplers, and (3) the use of such  optoelectronic devices for measuring the
              response of ultrafast  electronic devices.    Scope:  This award will provide
              the linkage costs for US and  Indian collaborators.  This study, while in the
              realm of fundamental  physics, is in an emerging research area that combines
              ultrafast  optics and electronics.  The topic is of considerable current
              interest  and the devices under study may in the future be integral to all 
              communication and computer systems.  In addition to initiating new  scientific
              collaborations, this project will contribute toward the  ultrafast spectroscopy
              laboratory at TIFR becoming a world-class  facility.  All the experimental work
              will be performed at TIFR and  will include advanced graduate students and
              postdocs.  The  scientific and technological benefits are mutual and the
              research  results will be published in international journals.          ***
