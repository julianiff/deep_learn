Abstract    :
              9702443  Nied   This research project is to develop design principles for
              integrating design and manufacture of load bearing structural components
              fabricated from thermoplastic materials.  The mechanism for achieving this plan
              is the design and forming of advanced structural parts from thermoplastic
              materials using blow molding and thermoforming processes.   The outcomes of
              this study could significantly improve the linkage between processing
              mechanics, material behavior, and structural performance of the load bearing
              applications.   The research activities have balanced theory and experiments to
              adequately characterize the process physics, developing process simulation
              models, and the necessary testing techniques to measure the relevant polymer
              materials properties that are uniquely required for thermoforming and blow
              molding  process simulation. The research activities will be balanced by an
              education plan to improve quality of graduate and undergraduate education at
              Lehigh University.
