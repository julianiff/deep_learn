Abstract    :
               Communication of cells with their environment is made possible through a
              process called signal transduction.  This mechanism is mediated largely by
              calcium channels which allow the passage of calcium ions to the inside. 
              Intracellular calcium elicits various responses such as muscle contraction or
              neurotransmitter release.  Calcium channels are formed by different subunits. 
              The central ideal of this project by Dr. Garcia-Martinez is to determine the
              role of the alpha-2-delta subunit in signal transduction in skeletal muscle,
              cardiac muscle, and neurons.  This will be accomplished by measuring levels of
              the alpha-2-delta subunit during development and correlating these levels with
              changes in signal transduction.  A blend of powerful techniques, including
              electrical recording of calcium-channel activity and molecular analysis of the
              calcium-channel protein conformation, will be used.  Determining the function
              of the alpha-2-delta subunit in signal transduction is crucial for
              understanding cell physiology.  The education plan includes the creation of a
              new course on several topics in physiology and biophysics of ion channels.  The
              goals of the course include teaching students to think analytically and to
              stimulate their interest in research.  Another aspect of the education plan is
              to attract and retain students from traditionally under-represented ethnic
              groups.  With this project, the PI will continue to make significant
              contributions to research and education.
