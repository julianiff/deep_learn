Abstract    :
              IBN 97-33006 WANG.  Working memory is an active form of short-term  memory. It
              is indispensable for any cognitive process where  information has to be
              maintained with attentive effort for a few  seconds, and manipulated "on-line",
              before it is erased and new  information is loaded. Examples are dialing a
              telephone number,  planning and executing a sequence of motor movements,
              reading, and  thinking. Experiments on behaving animals have started to uncover
               the neuronal basis of working memory in the prefrontal cortex. Dr.  Wang will
              use theoretical approaches, in complement with  laboratory experiments, to
              investigate how the working memory  function can be understood in terms of the
              physiology of single  neurons/synapses, the cortical circuit architecture, and
              emergent  collective network behavior.  In particular, possible neuronal 
              mechanisms will be studied by computer model simulations for  sustained
              neuronal activity (in seconds) and its selectivity to  memory items, including 
                     (a) reverberating activity across the cortical network,       (b) slow
              cellular and synaptic dynamics, and       (c) the role of recurrent synaptic
              inhibition.         Results from this research will help to understand the 
              functioning of normal working memory, its neuromodulation, as well  as its
              malfunctions.
