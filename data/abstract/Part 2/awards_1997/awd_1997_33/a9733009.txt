Abstract    :
              9733009  Chilkoti  The major goal of the proposed research is to reversibly 
              modulate protein-ligand affinity by a thermally-triggered  molecular switch
              attached to the protein scaffold in the  vicinity of the active site.  The
              design includes a novel  two-step strategy,  combining genetic circular
              permutation  with enzyme-assisted reversed proteolysis, to produce the  final
              protein-polymer conjugate.  The PI envisions future  development of a
              regenerable, semi-continuous biosensor  based on permustat-poly (NIPAAm)
              constructs that display  "off-rate" controlled affinity modulation.  The
              research  activity is complemented by an educational program which  addresses
              two primary aims: the establishment of an outreach  program for high school
              students within the Duke School of  Engineering, and the expansion of the
              Biomedical Engineering  curriculum to include new elective courses in the
              fields of  genetic engineering, molecular biology and protein  engineering.
