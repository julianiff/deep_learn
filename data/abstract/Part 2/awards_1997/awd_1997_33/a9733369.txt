Abstract    :
              Abstract - CTS-9733369    Milind A. Jog      Thermal plasmas are increasingly
              used in manufacturing and material processing where the high temperatures
              facilitates energy transport and the free electrons and ions provide an
              environment for chemical reactions.  Typical applications are plasma spraying,
              chemical vapor deposition, sintering, synthesis, speroidization, waste
              destruction, and net shape manufacturing.  In all of these applications, the
              heat transport from the plasma is critical in determining the quality of the
              product.  This proposal work is to develop an increased understanding of the
              fundamentals of the transport processes in the plasma and its interaction with
              solid/liquid surfaces, and to develop models and correlations for the heat
              transfer.  The processes associated with heat transfer from the plasma to a
              solid surface are significantly more complicated than for unionized gases
              because of the electrical sheath which lies close to the solid surface.  The
              proposed work involves the study of the heat transfer to a single particle
              moving in a thermal plasma.  The flow of the neutral gas, the electrons, and
              the ions will be determined.  Detailed analyses of the electric sheath, the
              production and recombination of charged particles, and the melting of the
              particle will be made.  The melting front will be determined using the
              Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian method.    The numerical predictions will be
              compared to experimental measurements in the literature of particle motion in
              induction plasmas and to visualizations of liquid droplets in gas flows. 
              Trends in droplet shape deformation will be predicted as functions of Reynold's
              and Weber numbers and liquid/gas viscosity and density ratios.
