Abstract    :
              9733588  Tian  This research project combines software reliability engineering 
              and software measurement to develop an integrated approach to  early
              measurement and improvement of software reliability. Key  research activities
              include: 1) Integrating research findings in  software reliability engineering
              and software measurement to  assess and improve software quality over extended
              development  phases and application domains. 2) Developing analysis techniques 
              and tools to effectively analyze diverse measurement data. 3)  Practical
              implementation of this integrated approach and  adaptation of it to a wide
              variety of software development  environments in collaboration with several
              industrial partners.  (4) Developing or enhancing several graduate and
              undergraduate  level courses in software engineering and computer science.  The
               key benefits of this research project include: (1)  a systematic  technique to
              measure software quality early in development and to  identify early problems
              for effective quality improvement, (2)  construction of support tools that can
              help the implementation  and deployment of these techniques in industry, and
              (3)  educational opportunities for students to work on leading edge  research
              projects that solve practical problems.  ***
