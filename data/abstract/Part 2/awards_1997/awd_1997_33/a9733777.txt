Abstract    :
              Shultz  9733777      The arthropods (arachnids, crustaceans, insects,
              centipedes, etc.) are  a very ancient and diverse group of animals that use
              many different  methods of locomotion. In all cases, locomotion depends on the 
              efficient interaction of two systems, namely, a skeletomuscular system  that
              provides the mechanical structures used in propulsion and a  neuromuscular
              system that controls the timing of movements. Recent  research on a wide range
              of animals suggests that evolution in the  skeletomuscular system is relatively
              fast and evolution of the  neuromuscular system is relatively slow. The PI will
              test this idea by  examining relative rates of evolution in skeletomuscular and
               neuromuscular features of the locomotor mechanisms of two arthropod  groups,
              the chelicerates (spiders, scorpions, etc.) and the  centipedes. This will be
              accomplished by mapping skeletomuscular and  neuromuscular features on
              phylogenetic trees and determining the  relative placement of the two types of
              characters in evolutionary  history. Fast-evolving characters are expected to
              appear near the ends  of the branches in the tree, while the slowevolving
              features are  expected to appear near the base. The results of the project may
              show  that there are general patterns in the evolution of form and function.
