Abstract    :
              Raskin  9733826  This is an award to support a project proposed in accord with
              the  Guidelines for Submission of Proposals to the Faculty Early  Career
              Development (CAREER) Program, NSF 97-87.  As such, this  project has both a
              research and educational component.  Her  research component is based on a
              continuation of work initiated  under NSF Grant No. 94-10476.  It was aimed
              obtaining a better  understanding than now exists of the causes of foaming and 
              bulking problems associated with wastewater treatment by use of  suspended
              growth bioreactors as a step toward exercising control  of these problems.  Her
              new research objectives are to expand her  study of the role played by
              filamentous bacteria responsible for  causing these problems, optimize and
              validate procedures for  their detection and identification, and to apply
              nucleic acid  probes and molecular beacons in reactor studies to develop 
              rational control measures for foaming and bulking.    The Principal
              Investigator's educational component includes  improvement of existing courses
              dealing with water quality and  collaboration with Carollo Engineers, a
              consulting engineering  firm, to improve the design content of an
              undergraduate, senior  level course in water quality control.  Her education
              plan  includes integration of dynamic mathematical models, results of  her
              research and a relevant field experience into her graduate-  level course.  She
              also plans on development of a  workshop/graduate level laboratory course that
              reflects the  increasing importance of molecular biology procedures and their 
              application in environmental engineering practice.  Her plan is  to maintain
              strong contacts with several other environmental  engineering consulting firms,
              biotechnology and food processing  industries and municipalities for guidance
              in curriculum  development applicable to strengthening her research and
              teaching  activities.  ***
