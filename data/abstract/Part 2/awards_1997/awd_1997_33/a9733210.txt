Abstract    :
                 9733210  Coschigano   The aromatic hydrocarbon toluene is a hazardous
              substance that poses health risks to humans, particularly to the central
              nervous system. Individuals with long term exposures may exhibit memory loss,
              attention and concentration deficiencies, and poor abstracting abilities.
              Toluene is one of the most water soluable components of gasoline and other
              fuels and has been listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as a
              priority pollutant.  It is also a  widely used industrial solvent, being used
              in a large number of chemical processes.  This project will be the first use a
              combined genetic and molecular approach to study the non-oxygen mediated
              metabolism of an aromatic hydrocarbon using a bacterial isolate tentatively
              identified as a Thauera sp. that can degrade toluene under denitrifying
              conditions.  Preliminary genetic and molecular studies have already proven
              useful in gaining  insight into the mechanism   of the toluene metabolic
              enzymes of strain T1,  specifically the TutD gene product.  This project will
              elucidate function of TutD and its regulation and identify additional enzymes
              in the pathway of toluene degradation using molecular genetic approaches.   An
              essential component of this research is to provide an opportunity for both
              undergraduate student exposure to scientific research and for graduate student
              training.  Ohio University has a number of programs to encourage undergraduates
              to participate in laboratory research and this proposal will help to provide an
              opportunity for such research.  Opportunities for graduate student research at
              the Masters and doctoral level will also be provided.
