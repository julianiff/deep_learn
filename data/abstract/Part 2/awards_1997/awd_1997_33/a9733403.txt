Abstract    :
              Professor Todd Martinez of the University of Illinois is supported by a   CAREER
              grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to   develop
              theoretical tools that address nonadiabatic effects on gas- and  
              condensed-phase chemical reaction dynamics.  Photochemical cis/trans  
              isomerizations and ring opening/closing processes will be investigated   using
              calculations of potential energy surfaces, their couplings, and   multiple
              electronic state nuclear dynamics.  Improved continuum models   for predicting
              electronic structure in solution and quasi-ligand   approaches for reducing the
              number of electrons explicitly considered   will be employed.  Novel
              educational ideas include incorporating organic   photochemistry examples  and
              modern computational chemistry software into   undergraduate and graduate
              physical chemistry courses.   Photochemical processes are important in vision
              and biosynthesis of   vitamin D as well as synthetic organic photochemistry.  A
              detailed   understanding of the electronic structure and dynamics of these
              reactions   will increase our ability to design new photochemical synthetic
              routes or   control known photochemical reactions.  Incorporating these
              research   topics into college chemistry courses allows students to see the  
              relationship between concepts and real-world applications.
