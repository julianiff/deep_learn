Abstract    :
              This research develops representations and algorithms to manage large digital
              libraries of engineering   knowledge.  In engineering design, it is
              conservatively estimated that more than 75% of design activity is   case-based.
               This research identifies new computational methods for reasoning about complex
              geometric   and engineering information.  It develops the mathematical
              foundation and algorithmic tools to support   content-based retrieval from
              large engineering knowledge-bases (such as are generated by modern CAD  
              systems).  This research identifies: (1) classes of heuristic search algorithms
              for automated indexing and   retrieval of models from design knowledge-bases;
              (2) data structures for defining arbitrary relationships   among engineering
              data elements, based on their relationships through product model geometry; (3)
                search interfaces for supporting customized queries from outside agents. 
              Additionally, this project   develops an educational plan that integrates the
              core computer science curriculum with complex problems   drawn from real-world
              application domains. This is accomplished through incorporating
              interdisciplinary   problem solving into basic Computer Science classes,
              outreach activities with industry, and the National   Design
              Repository---digital textbook of design knowledge for users around the globe. 
              This CAREER plan   will have an extensive impact on engineering design and
              computer-aided manufacturing.  http://www.mcs.drexel.edu/ wregli/EKB
