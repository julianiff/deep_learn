Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9733310  Paul R. Van Tassel/ Wayne State U.    This grant is
              awarded through the  Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the
              Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The principal investigator is Dr. Paul
              Van Tassel of Wayne State University. An objective of the research is the
              elucidation of  protein adsorption onto affinity surfaces, including the
              effects of kinetics, ligand density and ligand spacer length on protein
              orientation. A second objective is to develop technology to control protein
              placement on a surface using electric fields and specific ligand placement. 
              The educational aspects of the PI's career development seek to integrate course
              development with laboratory experiments through web based interactive modules.
              An outreach program seeks to team up undergraduates with high school students
              to provide an enhanced educational experience to potential scientists and
              engineers.    The immobilization of protein molecules at a liquid-solid
              interface is an important aspect of enzyme catalysis, bioseparations and
              biomaterials coatings. Understanding how proteins adsorb onto surfaces and
              developing new techniques to manipulate this adsorption process has significant
              implications to the biotechnology industry.   ***
