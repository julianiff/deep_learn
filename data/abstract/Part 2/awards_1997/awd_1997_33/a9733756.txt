Abstract    :
              Abstract - Larsen - 9733756  Prof. Gustavo Larsen of U. Nebraska-Lincoln
              proposes to molecularly imprint transition metal oxides in order to impart them
              molecular recognition capabilities for catalytic reactions.  Zircona and
              titania surfaces will be imprinted by means of templating with dibenzamide,
              alpha-phenyl propionic acid, or N-benzoylbenzensulfonamide, and will be doped
              with Cr metal when H-dissociation activity is needed.  They will be
              characterized gravimetrically, with infrared spectroscopy, by
              temperature-programmed desorption of alcohols, and by probe reactions to test
              for chiral selectivity (dehydration or oxidative dehydrogenation of alcohols,
              and hydrogenation of  alpha-phenyl propionic acid).  The fundamental parameters
              governing the imprinting of zirconia and the stability at reaction conditions
              wll be identified.  The research will lead to new knowledge that helps a
              critical area of heterogeneous catalysis:  the ability to design catalysts with
              ultra-high selectivity.  If completely successful, the work will impact the
              fine chemical industries, including pharmaceutical and agrochemical processes. 
              The educational plan is a comprehensive agenda of activities that may highly
              affect the scientific human infrastructure in the State of Nebraska.  Part of
              the educational plan is targeted to junior and senior high-school students, who
              will be exposed to national laboratory and university research, and thus may
              will be exposed to national laboratory and university research, and thus may
              increasingly choose a career in science or engineering.  Some effort will be
              applied to the insertion of international students in the American system and
              the enhancement of international collaborations.  In addition, the teaching
              plan involves research experiences for undergraduate students as well as course
              development.
