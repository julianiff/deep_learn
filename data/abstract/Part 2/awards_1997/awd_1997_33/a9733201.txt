Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of a double annulation   strategy
              for the preparation of bicyclo(4.n.0)alkanes with multiple   functionality and
              substitution.  The utility of the method, which employs   a tandem Michael,
              Dieckmann sequence,  will be showcased by the   preparation of a number of
              interesting polyterpenoids.  The focus of the   educational activities is on
              course development featuring the use of    web-based, interactive  homework and
              essay assignments.  With this   Faculty Early Development (CAREER) award, the
              Organic and Macromolecular   Chemistry Program is supporting the research and
              educational activities   of Dr. Robert B. Grossman  of the Department of
              Chemistry at the   University of Kentucky.   Professor Grossman  will focus his
              research   efforts on developing synthetic methodology useful in the
              preparation of   organic compounds having interesting biological properties. 
              The   educational component of the award will stress course development in  
              undergraduate organic chemistry.
