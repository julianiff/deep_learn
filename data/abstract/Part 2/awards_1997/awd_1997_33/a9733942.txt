A central aim of school instruction is to facilitate the
              transfer of generalization of acquired knowledge beyond the initial learning
              context to new circumstances.  Recent efforts to develop curricula in which
              mathematics is embedded in meaningful contexts has given the transfer of
              leaning across contexts new relevancy.  However, transfer research has
              floundered in recent years due primarily to findings that transfer is difficult
              to engineer in the laboratory.  Furthermore two controversies in the literature
              indicate theoretical problems with the construct of transfer.  Unfortunately,
              many researchers have abandoned inquiry in this area, well short of reaching
              and understanding of transfer sufficient to provide much-needed guidance in
              designing and organizing learning environments.
