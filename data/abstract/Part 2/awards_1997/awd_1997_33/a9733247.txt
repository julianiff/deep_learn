Abstract    :
              9733247  King  Research is proposed to develop a novel lithography technique,
              one which would not only lower process cost but also enable a complete shift in
              the FPD manufacturing paradigm and thereby contribute to efforts to lower
              production costs for large-area electronics products in general.  Specifically,
              this technique will allow thin films to be patterned directly, without the need
              for an intermediary photoresist mask or hard mask.  It employs a high-fluence
              projection lithography tool to selectively expose the substrate through a mask.
               The direct Patterning of a silicon film has already been successfully
              demonstrated in an initial study.  Further work is proposed to develop
              direct-patterning processes for silicon, dielectric, and metal films, and to
              demonstrate these processes in the fabrication of polycrystalline-silicon
              thin-film transistors (TFTs).  The new technique should have a distinct
              throughput advantage over established ablation techniques, as well as improved
              cleanliness (fewer particulates) or lower associated mask costs.  ***
