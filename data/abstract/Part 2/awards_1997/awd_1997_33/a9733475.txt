Abstract    :
              ***  9733475  Chong  Microprocessor performance continues to increase faster
              than  memory performance, so that computer systems face a memory  bottleneck. 
              The goal of this project is to distribute logic  within memory systems so that
              some computations can be  performed in the memory system without transferring
              data to  the processor. By fabricating field-programmable gate arrays  and
              memory on the same chip, computations for fine-grained  data manipulation can
              be distributed to the memory system at  run time to speed up specific
              applications.A crucial  research issue in such a design is the partitioning of 
              computations between high-performance processors and the  distributed logic.
              This project is investigating this  partitioning on a range of appilications,
              including integer  programming for compiler register allocation, filters for 
              image and video editing, internet routing, graph matching  for intrusion
              detection, and protein sequence matching.  Educational plans include the
              updating of several existing  courses in computer architecture, the development
              of new  courses in reconfigurable computing, and the incorporation  of
              undergraduate research into the project.  Expected  outcomes of this project
              include a methodology for designing  reconfigurable memory systems and using
              them in  computations, an infrastructure of simulation tools and  hardware
              prototypes, students trained in applications-driven  system design, and
              web-based educational software to support  collaborative projects in computer
              architecture.  ***
