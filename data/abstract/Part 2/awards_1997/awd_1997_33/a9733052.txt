Abstract    :
              The focus of this research if the time-resolved infrared (TRIR) studies   of
              organic reactive intermediates.   TRIR spectroscopy will be used to   examine
              the structure and reactivity of biradicals, carbenes, nitrenium   ions and the
              excited states of ketones and enones.  The experimental   approach, coupled
              with computational methods, will enhance basic   understanding  and will
              address specific unresolved issues in reactive   intermediate chemistry.  With
              this Faculty Early Development (CAREER)   award, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program is supporting the   research and educational activities of
              Dr. John P. Toscano of the   Department of Chemistry at Johns Hopkins
              University.   Professor Toscano   will focus his research efforts on the
              time-resolved infrared studies of   organic reactive intermediates.  The
              structural information gained from   the research will be used to clearly
              define, interpret and understand the   reactivity of a variety of important
              photo-generated species.  The   educational activities are focused on outreach
              at the K-12 level,   undergraduate research and on forming research connections
              with faculty   at undergraduate teaching institutions.
