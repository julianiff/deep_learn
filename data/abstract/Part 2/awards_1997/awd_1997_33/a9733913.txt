Abstract    :
              This research addresses the problems of detection and recognition  of 
              deformable  articulated shapes, such as people  and  animals,  from  real
              images. The aim is to develop a Top-down and Bottom-up  recognition strategy,
              where the Bottom-up detects features, group  them,  and access the object
              model, while the Top-down  uses  the  object model to search for features.
              Objects are represented in a  tree-graph  structure  derived  from  a  shape 
              axis  model.  The  information  stored in the nodes include probabilities, 
              used  to  specify  likely geometric deformations of the object and  of  the 
              imaging  function.   The  tree-graph  structure  allows   for   a  description 
              of  occlusions and articulations in  terms  of  tree  matching   operations.  
              To  further  reduce  the   computational  complexity of the task, an
              information theory criteria is studied  to  determine features which convey
              information about the objects  in  the  image.  The PI will also develop and
              teach two  courses,  one  of them new to NYU, to support a focused program in
              computer  vision;  these  course will be``Introduction to Vision'',  and  a 
              specialized course in ``Grouping and Recognition''.
