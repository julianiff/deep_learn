Abstract    :
              Dr. Cassandra L. Fraser, Chemistry Department, University of Virginia, is  
              supported by a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award from the  
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program.  The   utility of
              halo-methyl derivatives of bipyridine or phenanthroline metal   complexes will
              be tested as living polymerization reagents for the   preparation of metal core
              macromolecules in the form of star, heteroarm   star, and star block
              copolymers.  Research efforts include polymerization   of oxazolines, styrenes
              and acrylates; functionalization of   macromolecules via nucleophilic
              termination agents; and examination of   block length and composition influence
              upon aggregation behavior.  In an   associated educational effort, the second
              year of a two-year introductory   honors sequence and a graduate level
              transition metal course will be   redesigned.  The central motif of the
              undergraduate course is an   interdisciplinary approach to science education
              while the graduate course   utilizes an interactive seminar format. 
              Metal-containing macromolecules have a wide range of potential   applications
              that exploit the unique characteristics of the metal complex   core.  Metal
              core macromolecules may serve as liquid crystals, supported   catalysts and
              optical or electrochemical sensors.  Interdisciplinary and   seminar approaches
              to chemistry education will be introduced at the   undergraduate and graduate
              levels, respectively.
