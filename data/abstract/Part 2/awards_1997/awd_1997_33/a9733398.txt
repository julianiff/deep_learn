Abstract    :
                9733398  Baski    This CAREER project addresses fundamental surface science
              aspects  of metal-semiconductor interfaces. The growth behavior of noble 
              metals will be examined on unique templates provided by  high-index ("tilted")
              silicon surfaces. The structural and  electronic properties of these interfaces
              will be studied using  scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in conjunction with 
              first-principles, electronic-structure calculations. This  approach is expected
              to enable the development of atomic  structural models and a deeper
              understanding of the formation and  properties of these interfaces. The
              research is motivated by  recent STM investigations of clean high-index
              surfaces oriented  between (001) and (111) that have revealed unique row-like 
              structures which do not exist on the more well-known low-index  surfaces. It is
              anticipated that the underlying Si structure will  cause metal overlayers to
              form novel structures on the nanometer  scale (e.g. nanowires). A complementary
              teaching component of  this project focuses on course development in an
              introductory  calculus-based physics sequence. Labs for this three-semester 
              sequence will introduce computer-interfaced experiments and more  effective
              integration of lecture components. The aim is to  provide a firm foundation in
              materials physics, and especially to  develop studentsO experimental and
              analytical skills.  %%%  The project addresses forefront research issues in a
              topical area  of materials science having high technological relevance.  The 
              research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a  fundamental
              level to important aspects of electronic materials  and devices, in general. An
              important feature of the program is  the emphasis on education, and on the
              integration of research and  education through the training of students in a
              fundamentally and  technologically significant research area.  ***
