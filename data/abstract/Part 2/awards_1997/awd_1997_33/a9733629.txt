This project was submitted in response to the CAREER Program
              solicitation.  It is a five-year career development plan that integrates
              research and teaching goals.
The major scientific objective is to provide a
              quantitative process model for the phase changes (solid or liquid) of
              internally mixed inorganic atmospheric aerosol particles.  The model will
              consider water-soluble compounds (e.g., ammonium sulfate) and water-insoluble
              chemical substances (e.g., titanium dioxide).  A series of laboratory
              experiments will be carried out to provide empirical input to the process
              model.  The investigator will study the efflorescence, the deliquescence, and
              freezing properties of the mixed-phase aerosol particles.  Infrared
              spectroscopy (IR) will be used to investigate phase transformations of the
              internally mixed aerosol systems.
The educational plan consists of three
              goals: (1) curriculum development to produce two new courses; (2) instructional
              tool development to consist of an electronic teaching module on surface
              chemistry that is linked to the internet; and (3) undergraduate research
              training.  Two innovations proposed as part of the teaching activities are: (1)
              a summer research experience for two undergraduate students; and (2)
              incorporation of internet-based technology as part of the course content.  The
              summer research experience will include a summer short course on research
              methodology.  Results from the summer research will be linked directly in
              electronic format to the new courses.
