Abstract    :
              The focus of this research project is to develop an  integrated compiler and
              run-time system for global data  distribution.  The goal is for the integrated
              system to  execute large-scale, multi-phase parallel scientific  applications
              more efficiently than can be done with static  analysis alone. First, compiler
              analysis will be developed  to divide a program into its component phases as
              well as  pass useful hints to the run-time system about intra-phase  behavior,
              such as the communication pattern.  Second, the  necessary run-time analysis
              will be developed to support  multi-phase applications and to make use of the
              compiler  information.  A framework will be investigated to determine  at run
              time an efficient global data distribution over a  reasonable set of possible
              distributions.  This means that a  distribution will be determined for each
              array in each  program phase, with possible redistribution between phases, 
              that results in good application performance. Furthermore,  if application
              characteristics change during execution, the  distribution will be changed
              accordingly.  The integrated  system will be measured on a variety of
              large-scale,  adaptive parallel scientific programs.
