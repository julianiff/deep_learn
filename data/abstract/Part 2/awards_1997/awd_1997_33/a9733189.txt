Abstract    :
              Professor Sabre Kais of Purdue University is supported by a CAREER grant   from
              the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to develop and   apply
              renormalization group, finite-size scaling, and the pivot method   for
              calculating electronic structure of atoms and molecules.  The long   term goal
              is accurate predictions of atomic and molecular properties at   low
              computational cost.  Novel educational ideas include updating the   content of
              undergraduate and graduate curricula, incorporating   interactive group
              projects into courses, and introducing conceptual tests   during lectures. 
              Performing highly accurate calculations of molecular properties obviates   the
              need for many mundane or even hazardous chemical experiments.  It   also allows
              for the exploration of regions of potential energy surfaces   and transient
              species not routinely accessible by experiment.  The use of   both qualitative
              and quantitative research techniques in chemical   education provides
              information on student performance, motivation, and   understanding.
