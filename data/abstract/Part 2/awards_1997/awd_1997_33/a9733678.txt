Abstract    :
              Constraint Databases (CDBs) are an extension of relational databases that enrich
              both the relational data model and the relational query primitives with
              constraints. For data-intensive applications over non-traditional data, CDBs
              hold the promise to combine the versatility of constraints with the commercial
              success of the relational approach. This project focuses on the internal query
              representation of CDBs queries, i.e., Constraint Query Algebra (CQA). CQA forms
              the "middle layer" of CDBs, underneath the user interface layer and above the
              disk access layer, providing a homogenous set of operators for expressing
              queries over any data. The following challenges related to CQAs are addressed,
              both from a theoretical and a practical perspective, leading to an
              implementation of CQA: (1) efficient data representation and algebraic operator
              implementation; (2) novel indexing and query optimization techniques; (3) safe
              use of additional operators and; and (4) integration with front-end query
              languages. This project involves collaboration with researchers in other
              disciplines, such as Geography and Environmental Sciences, where the research
              involves large quantities of spatio-temporal data. This research is expected to
              revolutionize the spatio-temporal systems that will enable researchers and
              practitioners in the areas of Geography and Environmental Sciences to store and
              query their data more efficiently.
