              Yang    Title: Ionic polarized polymer light-emitting diodes fabricated by
              ink-jet printing technology      Conjugate polymers are a novel class of
              semiconductor materials that combine the optical and electronic properties of
              semiconductors with advantages of simple processing and flexible mechanical
              properties of polymers.  Due to its low cost and ease of fabrication this
              unique class of materials will revolutionize many existing electronics and
              bio-medical technologies. This CAREER proposal will engage in research and
              education activities to lay down the foundation for a consolidated polymer
              electronics research center at UCLA.  In particular, the research is aimed
              developing new and novel polymer light-emitting diodes using an innovative
              ink-jet printing technique.  the particular innovation of this proposal is the
              novel and potentially low-cost fabrication of large-area displays.
