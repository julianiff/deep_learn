Abstract    :
              Time varying environments and limited battery energy are two key hurdles on the 
              route to distributed multimedia systems with wireless network links.  This 
              project is exploring architectures, protocols, and algorithms to overcome these
               hurdles for mobile users.  In particular, the research is exploring the use 
              reconfigurability in wireless nodes to allow algorithms and protocols to adapt 
              to evolving environments.  The reconfigurable wireless node leads to
              interesting  system-level concepts such as hardware applets, in which hardware
              datapaths can  be downloaded and instantiated on demand from network servers.  
               The educational component of the project is based on tightly integrating the 
              proposed research with new graduate and undergraduate courses.  The research 
              topics will be explored in project-oriented graduate courses on mobile
              multimedia  information systems and wireless terminal design.  Selected
              prototyping tasks  will be used as projects in undergraduate design courses.
