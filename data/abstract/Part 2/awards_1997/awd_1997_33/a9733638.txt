	This project was submitted in response to the CAREER Program
              solicitation.  It is a four-year career development plan that integrates
              research and teaching goals. The major science objectives focus on the
              importance of atmospheric CO in tropospheric chemical processes for the
              background marine atmosphere.  Specifically, the PI  will use isotopic chemical
              information (i.e., 14CO, 13CO, C18O): 1) to quantify the rate of CO loss in the
              tropics (where OH concentrations are high); and 2) to characterize the relative
              temporal trend in source strengths for atmospheric CO.  The loss rate of CO
              through reaction with OH will be determined by measuring 14CO.  The stable
              isotope composition (13CO and C18O) will be used to help constrain temporal
              trends in the relative source strengths of atmospheric CO.  Weekly air samples
              will be collected over a three-year period at the Mauna Loa Observatory and
              will be analyzed for the three CO isotopomers and for CO atmospheric abundance.
               Over the same sampling period the 14CO annual production rate in the lower
              troposphere will be measured and these data will be compared to model
              simulations obtained from the NASA Goddard 3-D Global Chemistry Transport
              Model.  These proposed activities will shed new information on the source
              strengths of atmospheric CO, particularly over the tropical Pacific Ocean.
              

	The education plan uses the proposed atmospheric CO studies as a mechanism
              for involving undergraduate students in research.  The PI's philosophy is to
              provide undergraduates with problem-solving opportunities that include
              equipment building and instrument operation as part of the research plan. 
              Specifically, the PI will establish an undergraduate consortium of 5-10
              students to work with him each semester on a directed project.  Projects will
              require laboratory work, field work, and data interpretation and analysis. 
              Also, the PI will establish partnerships with private industry to generate
              informal internships for students to assist them in obtaining employment within
              these companies.
