Abstract    :
              Tianquan Lian of Emory University is supported by the Experimental   Physical
              Chemistry Program to investigate the dynamics of chemical   reactions occurring
              at the semiconductor-liquid interface of nanoparticle   colloids using
              femtosecond infrared laser spectroscopy.  He will focus on   two fundamental
              processes in these systems:  photo-induced interfacial   charge transfer
              dynamics and the subsequent interfacial bimolecular   chemical reaction
              dynamics of radicals.  The education plan of this   CAREER award emphasizes the
              incorporation of laser spectroscopy into the   undergraduate curricula, as well
              as the implementation of Problem Based   Learning techniques in undergraduate
              science classes.    Semiconductor nanoparticles are an important class of new
              materials.    They offer unique opportunities to study fundamental problems in
              the   interdisciplinary areas of chemistry, physics and materials science, as  
              well as many potential applications such as solar energy conversion,   waste
              degradation, and nanoelectronics.  The detailed understanding   resulting from
              these studies will have an important impact on the   application of
              semiconductor nanoparticles, since the processes to be   studied determine the
              efficiency and the chemical stability of any   devices made from such
              nanoparticles.  Results from this study will also   add to the general
              understanding of the dynamics in the solid-liquid   interface, which is
              essential for the design and application of many   important devices and
              processes such as the solar cell, electrochemistry   and heterogeneous
              catalysis.
