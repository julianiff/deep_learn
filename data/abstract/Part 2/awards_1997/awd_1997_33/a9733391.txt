Abstract    :
                  9733391  Buck    This project applies modern signal processing techniques 
              to  develop   new  instruments  and  algorithms  for  behavioral  studies  of 
              marine  mammals.  The  specific  focus  of  the  projects  will  be  on  tools
              to help  understand  the  link  between  the  vocal and physical behavior of
              these  animals.  An  common  difficulty  in  most  investigations  into  this 
              question  is  obtaining  extensive observations  of  animals  which spend a
              majority of their time beneath the surface  of  the   water.    For  this 
              reason,  the  visual   behavioral  observation techniques used for terrestrial
              animals  are  of  limited   effectiveness,  and  we  must  pursue  observation 
              methods   incorporating   modern   signal   processing   and  acoustical
              techniques.  This project will develop three such  tools.   The  first  is  an
              underwater video/audio  recorder  which  can  indicate which animal in the 
              video  picture  is  making  the  sound.   The second is  an  algorithm  for 
              the  controlled synthesis of bottlenose dolphin whistles to allow  controlled 
              tests  of  which  acoustic  features  of   these  whistles are important to the
              animals.  The final project is  the  ongoing development computer algorithms
              for recognition  and  classification of marine mammal calls investigating the 
              possibility  of  identifying specific individuals  based  on  their   calls.  
              The  project  also  incorporates  classroom  activities   encouraging 
              collaborative   learning   between  biologists   and   engineers.   Public 
              awareness   of   the  importance  of  sound in the ocean will  be  raised 
              through  participation in the design of several aquaria exhibits.
