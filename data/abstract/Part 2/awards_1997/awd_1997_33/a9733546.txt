Abstract    :
              This CAREER award to Dr. Bo Hong at the University of California-Irvine   is
              supported by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division.   The
              focus of the research is the synthesis and photo- and redox-active   behavior
              of novel types of molecular rods and macrocyclic molecular   squares with rigid
              sp carbon chain spacers.  Systematic synthetic   approaches will be applied to
              a series of rigid rod spacers with   cumulenic and acetylenic carbon chains
              which will be used in the   construction of molecular rods and squares which
              contain photostable   organometallic moieties with donor and acceptor
              properties.  These rigid rods and squares will have defined structures with  
              controllable distances between donor and acceptor sites and controllable  
              cavity sizes. These features are important to molecular electronic and  
              photonic devices, light to energy conversion, molecular recognition and  
              host-guest chemistry.  The redox properties and photophysics of the novel  
              constructs will be investigated, particularly electronic communication  
              between multiple redox centers and directional photoinduced   electron/energy
              transfer across sp-carbon spacers.  The teaching aspect of the CAREER award
              will emphasize the training and   retention of women students at both the
              graduate and undergraduate levels   and the integration of teaching and
              research at the undergraduate level.   A `Women in Science` discussion group,
              organized by Dr. Hong,  will be   expanded to include outside speakers
              addressing issues such as dual   careers, interviewing, coping strategies,
              childcare, outreach programs   and history of women in science. The goal of
              this activity is to provide   practical solutions to real world problems and
              concerns of women    students.
