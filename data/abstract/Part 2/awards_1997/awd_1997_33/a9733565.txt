Abstract    :
              This CAREER project addresses the complex problem of  modeling, analysis, and
              experimental investigation of  nonlinear characteristic related to smart
              materials, such as  piezo-ceramic composites, and investigates their
              application  in vibro-acoustic energy conduction transduction,  dissipation and
              excitation. This research is vital for  meeting critical needs in applications
              such a structural  noise and vibration control, non-destructive testing and 
              evaluation, health monitoring of structures and machinery,  music and
              micro-electro-mechanical systems. The education  plan  is integrated fully with
              the proposed research topic.  It included outreach activities involving inner
              city youth  through the medium of music via a non profit program called  Music
              Education Reaching Instrumental Talent (MERIT). In  this program, the PI plans
              to incorporate a sequence of  instructions on `Science and Engineering in
              Music.` In  addition, he plans to augment the laboratory experience in  UIC
              Minority Engineering Recruitment and Retention Program  with `Science and
              Engineering of Musical Instruments,` in  which students first study traditional
              musical instruments,  and then design and develop their own musical instrument.
               The project will result in a better understanding of vibro-  acoustic energy
              transmission, and engineering concepts via  musical acoustics.
