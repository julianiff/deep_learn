Abstract    :
              9733007  Moghe  The research program of this career award is to develop a 
              technology to quantitatively evaluate matrix microstructure  and the
              corresponding cellular activities within  biodegradable tissue analog matrices.
               Specific aims are to:  (1) develop a novel imaging methodology to
              quantitatively  investigate topological and bulk microstructure of 3-D 
              biodegradable porous tissue analogs under physiological  conditions; (2) design
              novel microstructural configurations  of polymeric matrices that promote the
              phenotype and  functions of cultured liver cells; and (3) examine the  effect
              of polymer degradation on the topological and bulk  matrix microstructure and
              the local physico-chemical  conditions to the physiology of liver cells.  For
              the  teaching component of this award, the specific aims are to:  (1) develop
              an innovative university-wide curriculum in  Tissue Engineering which reflects
              a focus on biomaterials  engineering; (2) establish a new course for students
              from  regional high schools with the goal of offering to selected  students a
              broad study of bioengineering as a field  combining life sciences with the
              physical sciences and  mathematics; and (3) extend outreach to other
              universities  and high schools by distance instruction through an internet- 
              based network.  ***
