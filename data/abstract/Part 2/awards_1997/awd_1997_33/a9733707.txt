Abstract    :
                9733707  Goldman    This CAREER project bridges atoms to devices striving to
              link  basic materials science with technology. Direct correlations  between
              atomic scale processes occurring during epitaxial growth  and electronic
              properties will be investigated using a  combination of epitaxial growth,
              in-situ and ex-situ  measurements. The P.I. will develop a series of laboratory
               modules in electronic materials which parallel these basic  investigations,
              and incorporate them into undergraduate courses.  Initial systems for study
              include InAs-based films and  heterostructures whose high electron mobility and
              surface  accumulation make them promising as magnetic field sensors for 
              automotive applications. This project will investigate how  details of atom
              attachment on a surface affect the electron  mobility of a thin film, and its
              resulting performance as a  magnetic field sensor. Graduate students will be
              exposed to  research spanning fundamental materials science to applied 
              aspects. Undergraduate students will actively participate in the  design,
              construction, and utilization of electronic and magnetic  measurement systems,
              which will serve as prototypes for  undergraduate laboratory modules to develop
              studentsO  experimental and analytical skills, and to enhance learning  through
              discovery.  %%%  The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical
               area of materials science having high technological relevance.  The research
              will contribute basic materials science knowledge at  a fundamental level to
              important aspects of electronic materials  and advanced devices. An important
              feature of the program is the  emphasis on education, and on the integration of
              research and  education through the training of students in a fundamentally and
               technologically significant research area.  ***
