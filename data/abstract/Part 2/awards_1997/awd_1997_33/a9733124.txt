Abstract    :
              DMI-9733124  Kasarda  Active magnetic bearings are a proven technology in
              turbomachinery applications, but their use in manufacturing equipment has
              received surprisingly little attention.  These bearings are feedback mechanisms
              that support a spinning shaft by levitating it in a magnetic field.  They
              increase operating efficiencies, improve control of rotor dynamics, and reduce
              equipment maintenance and waste associated with the replacement of used
              lubricants.  The feedback nature of the magnetic bearing also allows for the
              use of the bearing as a load cell to measure shaft forces.  The research plan
              of this CAREER project will investigate a new and innovative use of the force
              measurement capability of active magnetic bearings to supply information for
              statistical process control in manufacturing applications to improve the
              process/quality control of such products as textile fibers and photographic
              films.  Research tasks include the investigation of the design of active
              magnetic bearing systems for optimum shaft force measurement, development of
              on-line system calibration procedures, and the design and construction of an
              active magnetic bearing test rig for experimental verification. Components of
              this research are linked to the educational portion of the career development
              plan to promote the integration of engineering practice and engineering
              science.  This is accomplished partly through the development of a new
              "hands-on" undergraduate course in predictive/preventive maintenance with an
              innovative utilization of the resources at the Virginia Tech Power Plant.   The
              impact of this career development plan includes improving the design of active
              magnetic bearings for use in manufacturing equipment and enhancing the ability
              of US manufacturers to improve process/quality control.  This plan also impacts
              education by the incorporation of engineering practice into engineering
              education, resulting in the increased effectiveness in the preparation of
              graduating engineers for industry's needs.
