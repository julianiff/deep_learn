Abstract    :
              DMI-9733747  Twomey   Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) require large numbers of
              observations to ensure good generalization, and a large number of independent
              observations (or data) to evaluate the networks generalization performance. 
              ANN are potentially one of the most important data processing technologies in a
              truly intelligent system for the monitoring and control of manufacturing
              processes.  However, manufacturers are often reluctant, if not resistant, to
              use an ANN approach because of the associated costs of user expertise, long
              development times, and the need for large amounts of training data. Very little
              research has been performed on evaluation methods,  and the problems of
              training and evaluation concurrently, when data is sparse, have been
              overlooked.  The research objective of this CAREER project is to develop an ANN
              training and evaluation strategy for manufacturing situations where data is
              sparse.  The approach in the project seeks the simultaneous use of sparse data
              for both network training and evaluation. The results of this research will be
              applied to two manufacturing processes: drilling and electrochemical machining.
                The utilization of ANN and other information processing technologies will be
              developed into courses for the undergraduate curriculum.   The research will
              increase the utility of ANN through the development of an ANN training and
              validation strategy in cases where data is sparse.  Together with the
              development of curriculum in information processing, the project will provide a
              means for attracting talented students to careers in research, and will embody
              practices that encourage women and ethnic minorities to see themselves as
              tomorrow's engineers.
