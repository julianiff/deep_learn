Abstract    :
              This CAREER program has a scientific component that is directed toward the
              modification and measurement of Rydberg atomic wavepackets.  Chirped pulses
              will be used to shift the revival of a wavepacket arbitrarily in time in
              single-electron excitations.  In two-electron atoms, one electron will be
              excited to a Rydberg state while a second pulse causes the second electron to
              oscillate between the ground and excited states.  The educational component is
              focused on the development of a set of interactive, web-based introductory
              science courses.  Interaction with engineering faculty in this endeavor
              enhances the multidisciplinary nature of the new courses.
