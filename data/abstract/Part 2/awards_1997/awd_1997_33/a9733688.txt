Abstract    :
                9733688  Schrag    This  award  supports  a program of research,  teaching 
              and  curriculum  development focused on questions  regarding  the  history  of 
              oceans and climate over a range of  timescales.  In  one project, we will
              examine the last several decades of  ocean circulation in the tropical Pacific.
               Using corals  as  stationary monitors of surface ocean radiocarbon content, we
               will  examine  how bomb-produced radiocarbon has  penetrated  into  the
              surface ocean, and then has been redistributed  by  upwelling  and the movement
              of surface currents, essentially  adding  a  time  dimension  to the
              information  gained  from  surface  water sampling by the GEOSECS program.  The
               second  project   is   concerned  with  reconstructing   interannual 
              variability  in the position of the Indonesian Low  Pressure  System for
              windows of time several thousand years ago,  with  the  objective of better
              understanding how ENSO responds  to  changes  in the mean climate state.  We
              will collect  fossil  corals from uplifted coral reefs in Indonesia from
              locations  where  oxygen isotope records from modern corals show strong 
              correlation with ENSO.  The Holocene timeseries we   produce  will  be 
              compared  with predictions from ocean  circulation  models.   For the teaching
              component, the award will support  a  new initiative which provides students in
              government  and  public  policy  exposure to research  in  climatology  as  a 
              participant in Schrag's research group.
