Abstract    :
              This project aims to provide a foundation for applying machine learning in
              practice.  The research   component has two goals. Firstly, to develop data
              collection and refinement methods that allow machine   learning algorithm to
              extract structure from data.  Secondly, to perform empirical and theoretical
              analyses   of machine learning algorithms to develop a deeper understanding of
              current and new methods, and to   uncover the characteristics of datasets that
              make them amenable to particular learning algorithms. The   education component
              of this project aims to provide practitioners with the foundation required to
              apply   machine learning successfully in practice by providing a deeper
              understanding of the type of structure that   various learning algorithms can
              detect, by creating tools for collecting data, by giving students hands on  
              experience applying machine learning in practice, and through
              inter-disciplinary research projects.  These   research and education
              activities are being performed in the context of several application domains,  
              including mapping global land cover of the Earth from remotely sensed data,
              content-based image   retrieval of high resolution CAT scans of the lung,
              learning to detect anomalies for computer security, and   on-board processing
              of planetary data.  In addition to its contribution to applied machine
              learning, this   project has the benefit that the successful application of
              machine learning to proposed application domains   will result in non-trivial
              contributions to medicine, computer systems development, and geography.
