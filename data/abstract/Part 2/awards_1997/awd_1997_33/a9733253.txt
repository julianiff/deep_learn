Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the investigation of the chemistry of  
              homo-allylic type carbonium ions as precursors to vinylcyclopropanes,  
              alkenylidene cyclopropanes and oligcyclopropanes.  An iterative   application
              of the methodology will be used to prepare biologically   active natural
              products such as FR-900848 and U-106305, both of which   contain
              oligocyclopropane structural units.   Extensions of the   methodology to solid
              phase synthesis and combinatorial library generation   will also be carried
              out.  The focus of the educational activities will   be the development of
              laboratory experiments involving combinatorial   chemistry.   With this Faculty
              Early Development (CAREER) award, the   Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program is supporting the research   and educational activities of Dr. Richard
              E. Taylor of the Department of   Chemistry at the University of Notre Dame.  
              Professor Taylor will focus   his research efforts on developing methods for
              the synthesis of   cyclopropane containing structural units.  The methodology,
              applied in an   iterative fashion, will give access to structurally novel  
              oligocyclopropanes.  This class of compounds has been shown to have  
              interesting biological properties. In addition, application of the   chemistry
              to solid-phase synthesis and combinatorial library generation   of diversely
              functionalized oligocyclopropane structural units will be   investigated.  The
              educational activities will center around the   introduction of combinatorial
              chemistry into undergraduate courses
