Abstract    :
              Jorgensen 9733685      Abstract  Exocytosis in neurons has become specialized in
              order to allow for the rapid secretion of neurotransmitter. A number of
              proteins involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking have been identified by
              biochemical purification from synaptosomes. Nevertheless, current models for
              neurosecretion are greatly limited because there is only an incomplete list of
              the proteins that are required for these processes. Genetic studies in the
              nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, could potentially identify the complete
              complement of genes required for synaptic function. C. elegans is particularly
              advantageous for such studies because it is possible to select for mutants
              defective in secretion. Using such screens, over 38 genes have been identified
              which are required for normal neurotransmission. The efficiency of these
              screens has generated more mutants than can be easily characterized using
              standard genetic techniques. Techniques to rapidly map and clone these genes
              lags far behind the ability to obtain mutants. Mutagenesis strategies using
              transposons modified to contain foreign plasmid sequences could allow the
              immediate cloning of mutant genes without the need to map the mutations. The
              aims of this proposal are to: 1) Develop methods to mobilize recombinant Tc3
              transposons in the germ line,  2) Develop techniques to mobilize a heterologous
              mariner element in C. elegans, 3) Train undergraduates to screen for
              neurotransmission mutants in C. elegans using a recombinant mariner element and
              to directly sequence the mutant genes in a single semester course.      The
              tools developed by this work will benefit the larger scientific community and
              accelerate experiments designed to analyze neurotransmission. The techniques
              developed will greatly increase the efficiency of forward genetic methods.
              Additionally, the development of these tools and reagents will provide students
              with a more complete laboratory experience.
