Abstract    :
                The proposed research investigates techniques to enhance the dual properties
              of robustness and adaptivity in communications systems.  Robustness allows the
              same transmission to work consistently well for a wide variety of channel
              conditions while adaptivity permits transmitter specialization to match
              estimated channel and traffic conditions.  We propose investigation of five
              specific techniques for improving robustness and adaptivity in practical
              systems.    First, we will develop new high-rate robust trellis codes to meet
              industry needs for robustness in digital audio broadcast and asymmetric digital
              subscriber loops.  Second, we will identify new families of rate-compatible
              trellis codes that provide rate flexibility for transmissions employing large
              constellations.  Third, we will explore the application of concatenated codes
              and iterative decoding (i.e. turbo codes) to the robust coding problem.  The
              fourth topic is the investigation of channel estimation for robust and
              rate-compatible trellis codes, and the fifth topic is an examination of how
              channel estimation accuracy affects the information rates achievable with
              Tomlinson-Harashima precoding.
