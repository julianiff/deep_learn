Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the elucidation of the calcium binding  
              properties and domain organization of calbindin D28K, a protein abundant   in
              specific nervous tissue and one of the larger EF-hand members,   containing six
              putative EF-hands.  The strategy involves the synthesis of   each EF-hand as a
              33-residue peptide sequence, which can then be   characterized individually or
              in combinations with other EF-hands.   Methodology for the for connecting the
              EF-hands to provide fragments   comprising more than one EF-hand is also
              described.   The focus of the   educational activities involves the the
              education of students through   laboratory experience and through course and
              curriculum development in   organic chemistry.  With this Faculty Early
              Development (CAREER) award,   the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              is supporting the   research and educational activities of Dr. Karin S.
              Akerfeldt of the   Department of Chemistry at Rutgers University, Camden.  
              Professor   Akerfeldt will focus her research efforts on protein
              structure-function   relationship studies using a synthetic approach that will
              delineate   calcium binding properties and domain organization of the EF-hand  
              proteins.  This class of proteins is present in eukaryotes and is   involved in
              a vast number of physiological processes.  Dr. Akerfeldt's   educational
              activities are involved with course and curriculum   development.
