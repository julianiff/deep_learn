Abstract    :
              9733068  Grady    This EPSCoR co-funded CAREER award will use primarily X-ray 
              absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to examine responses in dynamics  and structure
              at the glass transition.  The glass transition is  one of the most important
              phenomena in polymeric materials.  The  fundamental microscopic structural
              changes that occur with the  glass transition are not well understood, and
              perhaps even more  importantly, the fundamental reason that Tg occurs at the 
              specific temperature it does for each polymer is not understood.  Other
              techniques, including NMR spectroscopy and neutron  scattering, show that local
              structural and dynamic changes occur  at the glass transition.  XAS will be
              used to obtain quantitative  and precise structural information.  Preliminary
              data show that  XAS can be used to examine local changes at the glass
              transition.  This proposal describes a broad range of experimentation which 
              will examine the important changes occurring at the local level  as a polymer
              progresses through its glass transition.  These  experiments will enable an
              evaluation of a Lindemann-type  approach to the glass transition, an approach
              suggested by others  and explored in this proposal.  %%%  The educational
              component of this project will involve the  Minority Engineering Program (MEP).
               Almost 500 undergraduates at  the University of Oklahoma are members of the
              MEP, which is  limited to the historically underrepresented Black, Hispanic and
               American Indian ethnic minorities.  One-on-one interactions  between faculty
              and students are one of the keys to recruiting  and retaining these students. 
              The PI's association with the MEP  program includes all facets of the
              undergraduate experience, from  the recruiting process to graduation.  It will
              involve travel to  primarily minority high schools and talks designed to help
              with  the recruiting process.  ***
