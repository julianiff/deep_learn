Abstract    :
              This award supports the development of a theory of coordination by means of
              examining the interactions of various organizational styles with the
              environmental characteristics of different problem domains.  Organizational
              styles can be operationalized as sets of coordination mechanisms that enforce
              certain behaviors as part of the style.  However, not all coordination behavior
              arises from abstract organizational styles; much arises from standard responses
              to specific environmental (problem domain) characteristics.   This research
              aims to extend environment and organization models, represent standard
              responses to common environmental problems, and develop operational
              specifications for organizational styles.  This allows the interactions between
              environmental constraints and organizational styles to be reasoned about
              analytically.  Designers are not doomed to create coordinated systems with only
              a few simple organizational behaviors and large numbers of brittle
              domain-specific coordination heuristics.  Instead, given good environment
              models and certain other constraints (often dictated by existing human
              organizations), desiginers can make principled choices of computational
              organizations and standard environment-influenced coordination behaviors.  This
              project will result in a much richer set of tools for building and analyzing
              both multi-agent computer systems and integrating such systems with existing
              human organizations in applications such as distributed information gathering,
              distributed scheduling, and concurrent engineering.
