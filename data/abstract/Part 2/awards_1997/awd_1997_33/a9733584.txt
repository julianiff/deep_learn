Abstract    :
              This research focuses on improving simulation and test methodologies through the
               use of Concurrent Simulation (CS) and Multiple Domain Concurrent Simulation 
              (MDCS) algorithms. This project develops an efficient behavioral fault
              simulation  architecture that integrates well with structural and RTL models.
              The inherent  ability of CS to represent and store only unique behaviors from
              the fault free  experiment allows for excellent internal observation and
              comparative  experimentation. Furthermore, the use of MDCS algorithms provides
              compression  techniques for large simulations, overcoming memory bottlenecks
              while supporting  the creation of multiple experiment scenarios. This allows a
              designer to vary  parameters within any model and simulate it against other
              model configurations  in a single simulation. Activities being explored under
              this grant include: (a)  Developing algorithms for behavioral fault simulation,
              observability and  signature traces using CS and MDCS; (b) Reduction of memory
              requirements through  enhanced erratic experiment (infinite loop) detection,
              experiment compression  using MDCS algorithms and fault dropping. (c)
              Evaluation of algorithms that allow  the seamless integration of multilevel
              models.
