Abstract    :
              Abstract - CTS-9733662  Wang, Chao-Yang      The proposed work is to study the
              solidification processing of materials that feature a continuous compositional
              variation from ceramic to metal within a part.  Such materials, called
              Fuctionally Graded Materials, offer unique combinations of thermal resistance
              and mechanical strength, reduce thermal stresses due to the thermal mismatch
              between metal and ceramic, and near-net shapes.  Functionally Graded Materials
              offer a new dimension for satisfying the needs for high performance materials
              in aerospace, energy, and electronic industries.    The objectives of the study
              are to visualize particle migration, melt convection, and microstructural
              development during solidification, to understand the interactions between the
              particles and the growth front in the presence of convection, and to
              characterize the particle distributin and grain structure in the graded
              material.  The work will involve a combined experimental and modeling effort. 
              Transparent analog systems will be used to observe and measure particle motion
              and redistribution in a solidifying liquid.  Metal experiments and
              post-processing characterization will provide quantitative data on the graded
              microstructure.  A process model will be developed to predict graded
              ceramic-metal structures and to permit tailoring the material to specific
              functional requirements.  The results from this investigation will improve the
              commercial viability of Functionally Graded Materials.
