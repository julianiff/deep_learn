Abstract    :
              DMI-9733981  Sun    This career development project in textile chemistry and
              science involves both development of innovative surface modification
              technologies for functional textile materials and clothing and incorporation of
              research activities into textile chemistry education. The surface modification
              processes will be able to impart durable and regenerable chemical and physical
              properties to existing textile materials, which include durable and regenerable
              antimicrobial and pesticide protective functions. These materials can be used
              as medical protective clothing that can inactivate pathogens and prevent
              possible cross contamination, and as chemical protective clothing that can
              effectively detoxify chemicals on the surface of the fabrics. Furthermore, the
              materials are reusable, durable, and comfortable, which will replace currently
              used impermeable and disposable or thick and heavy materials, and significantly
              reduce heat stress to wearers, especially to those who work in harsh
              environments.  The innovative processes and technologies studied and developed
              in the research will be included in an undergraduate course of textile
              coloration and finishing and in a new graduate course on functional textile
              materials. It is anticipated that textile courses filled with up-to-date
              technologies and theories will motivate more talented students to major in
              textile science and strengthen the only textile program in the University of
              California system.
