Abstract    :
                  9733127  Martin     This award is made under the NSF CAREER Program.  The
              principal investigator, Dr. Martin, will carry out an integrated research and
              teaching program in which extensive use will be made of 4-dimensional animated
              output from a numerical model.  The research component is focused on an
              investigation of the structural and dynamical evolution of cyclones in the
              relatively unstudied late stages of the cyclone life cycle, including
              cyclolysis.  The study will employ the case study approach and will include
              simulations with a state-of-the-art, non-hydrostatic, mesoscale model and the
              use of potential vorticity diagnostics.  Special attention will be given to the
              role of latent heat release on the post-mature stage behavior of extratropical
              cyclones.  The educational component involves a variety of activities, all of
              which will use tailored versions of the same 4-dimensional model animation as a
              means of illustrating complex atmospheric phenomena.  These activities fall
              into two categories:  (1) outreach education to local primary and secondary
              schools and (2) curriculum enhancement, at all levels in the university
              classroom, through the development of course-specific World Wide Web links to
              current animated forecast model data.
