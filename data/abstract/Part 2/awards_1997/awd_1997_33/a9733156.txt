Abstract    :
              9733156  Schmidt  The overall goal of this  career program is to build a 
              nationally competitive program at the University of Texas-  Austin that
              integrates research and education in the field  of molecular and cellular
              tissue engineering, with a  particular focus on the nervous system.  The
              research part  of this program seeks to link quantitative molecular 
              information on the migration of the neuronal growth cone,  which guides axonal
              extension, to phenomenological  observations of nerve regeneration.  An
              electrically  conducting polymer, oxidized polypyrrole (PP), will be used  as a
              model system with which to stimulate axonal extension.  This material also has
              clear potential applications as a  component of devices to locally stimulate
              nerve  regeneration.  To gain a fundamental understanding of how  nerve
              regeneration is affected by an electrical stimulus, it  is to be determined
              whether electrical conduction through PP  directly modifies various
              intracellular events which are  critical for growth cone motility.  These
              experiments are to  be related to in vivo studies assessing rat sciatic nerve 
              regeneration under similar conditions.  The education part  of this program
              includes:  course development; curriculum  revision; mentorship; and outreach
              programs.  ***
