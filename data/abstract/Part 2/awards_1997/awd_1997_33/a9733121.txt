Semiconductor power devices form the heart of power electronics
              and are very important to the U.S. economy.  More specifically, they form the
              heart of the Power Electronics Building Block (PEBB).  The objective of the
              proposed research is to develop a new class of power semiconductor devices, the
              emitter-controlled thyristors (ECTs) for the PEBB.

The approach taken in
              developing the ECTs will include rigorous numerical modeling and analysis, as
              well as experimental verification through layout design and clean room
              fabrication.  Optimization of the ECT will also be done to assess its potential
              as a commercially viable power industry (Harris Semiconductor) and other
              universities (Stanford).

The specific objectives of an education plan are :
              1) to teach students the fundamental principles of semiconductor devices and
              their applications; 2) to develop a novel and innovative Web-based Virtual
              Technology CAD (VTCAD) system for semiconductor device education and research;
              3) to renovate and enhance existing courses with new materials directly from
              research covering advanced power semiconductor devices and power integrated
              circuits; 4) to continuously improve teaching skills by attending advanced
              teaching short courses or seminars, and by consulting students and peers on a
              regular basis; 5) to supervise graduate students and reach out to society.  The
              significance of planned educational activities is to provide graduates who are
              not limited to a specific job function, but who are equipped to learn new
              intellectual skills and knowledge and to make technological innovations that
              will serve our societal and national goals.
