Abstract    :
              9733502  Ram  Where do electrons go ? They emerge from the source and dive
              toward the drain.  Their path between drain and source is inferred from a
              detailed knowledge of the conductive terrain.  Manipulating the electron's path
              has been the goal of electrical engineering for over 100 years.  At the present
              time there is no practical technique for tracking the electron's journey
              through small circuits or devices.  This career plan is to develop a
              noninvasive current probe that is capable of monitoring the current
              distribution in electronic devices and circuits.    Magnetic force microscopy
              (MFM) can provide highly resolved images of the current path inside mesoscopic
              devices.  MFM's ability to sense magnetic field gradients over distances as
              small as 10 manometers can be used to sense the stray field surrounding a
              moving electron.  The potential for spatially resolving currents inside devices
              has not previously been available because of the limited (0.3 to 10 Jim)
              resolution of other field contrast microscopies.  Direct measurements of
              magnetic fields associated with interconnect lines and their associated
              inductances may provide insight into new circuit topologies.  An unprecedented
              look at the internal structure of the electron flow will enable the observation
              of theoretically predicted structures such as current vortices and electron
              shock waves.  Detailed images of current distributions would reveal such
              structures whereas previous external measurements of source and drain
              currents.could only infer their existence.    Seeing an electron's path
              involves representing the @ data in a visually engaging and meaningful way. 
              The graphical representation of such intangible, yet physical quantities brings
              together physics and aesthetics.  This interface can be a fruitful arena for
              the education of young scientists.  Building on the principal investigator's
              previous experience working together with art and science students on effective
              scientific visualization, this proposal develops a curriculum for  elementary
              school and college students.  ***
