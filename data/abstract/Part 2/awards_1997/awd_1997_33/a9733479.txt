Abstract    :
              This CAREER activity concentrates on a scientific project that focuses on the
              search for a small violation of Bose-Einstein statistics for photons.  This
              violation is manifest in the appearance of rare absorption events in a
              two-photon atomic transition.  The particular transition chosen for the search
              is the absorption of two equal-frequency photons from the J=0 ground state to
              the J=1 state of ytterbium.  It is estimated that this atomic-based test could
              provide a ten orders of magnitude better limit than the current upper limit of
              the Bose-Einstein statistics violation provided by the two-gamma decay of the
              Z-boson.  The educational component of the proposal involves considerable
              contributions to the teaching of upper-level physics courses plus a
              cross-disciplinary activity that introduces graphical programming language
              elements in the upper division courses.
