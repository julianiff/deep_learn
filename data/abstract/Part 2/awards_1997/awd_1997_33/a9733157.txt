Abstract    :
              9733157  Wooh  This is a Career Award.  The objective of the program is 
              twofold:  (1) Research:  Develop NDE sensors for high-speed  monitoring of
              defects in rail tracks and (2) Education:  Develop problem-based learning
              modules and interactive  course materials by bringing exciting research
              activities  into classrooms and the Internet.    This project is outlined as
              follows:              The needs of high-speed monitoring system for assessing  
                    rail condition and integrity are addressed.  It is pointed         out
              that a critical requirement is to develop a sensor         system that does not
              require contact with the rail surface.                          Needs of NDE
              Education:  The needs of introducing         innovative and cohesive NDE
              engineering curricula for         educating today civil engineering students
              are addressed.         The importance of educating students with
              multidisciplinary         background is pointed out.  Also discussed are the
              demands         of dynamic revision and practice-oriented civil engineering    
                  curricula.    Major impact of the project is the development and transfer 
              of technology to industry, and the potential to address  future engineering
              education curriculum.  ***
