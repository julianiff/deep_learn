              Proposal Number:  ECS-9733720  Principle Investigator:  Alexander Cartwright   
                  Abstract:        This proposed research is focused on the development of
              visible spatial light modulators (SLMs) using AlGaN, InGaN, and GaN material
              systems for application in the next generation of display and printer
              technologies. Specifically, III-N visible SLMs will be modeled, designed,
              fabricated, and tested by the PI and in collaboration with Eastman Kodak
              Company.  The investigation will include the Franz-Keldysh and
              quantum-confined-Stark effect in III-N materials, linear optical properties and
              ultra-fast dynamics of charge transport in p-i-n devices. The educational part
              of the proposal will extend PI's undergraduate research symposium to outreach
              programs including mentoring of minorities and women students in high schools
              and undergraduate school.
