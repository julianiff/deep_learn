Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9733066  Raul F. Lobo/U. Del.    This grant is awarded through the
               Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport
              Systems Division. The principal investigator is Dr. Raul Lobo at the University
              of Delaware. The research will investigate structure-property relationships of
              zeolite adsorbents used in gas separations. The research will involve
              characterizations of the adsorption sites using a combination of neutron, x-ray
              and NMR techniques, and studies to understand intermolecular interactions
              within zeolitic pores. The educational plan consists of (i) integration of
              research as part of undergraduate education (ii) development of courses at the
              graduate and sophomore level (iii) provide mentorship in a Resources to Insure
              Successful Engineers program.    The fundamental understanding of molecular
              phenomena within zeolite pores is of utmost interest to the chemicals
              processing industries. There are numerous reaction and separation processes
              that use zeolites as catalysts and adsorbents. The research could have an
              impact in the preparation of a new generation of zeolite adsorbents. The
              results of the research may have implications for the catalytic application of
              alkali-metal exchanged zeolites and the use of Li-containing zeolites as
              solid-state ion conductors.   ***
