Abstract    :
              Abstract - Klug -9733136    Prof. Christopher A. Klug, of Stanford University,
              will use in-situ NMR techniques to study two types of catalytic systems of
              importance to environmental catalysis and energy minimization issues. Supported
              metallocene catalysts for alkene stereoselective polymerization,  and supported
              vanadia for the decomposition of NOx and chlorohydrocarbons  will be studied.
              The PI will use various NMR techniques: CPMAS, 1 and 2-dimensional pulse NMR,
              homonuclear and heteronuclear dipolar coupling experiments. He will also
              develop multiply tuned NMR probes and in situ catalysis-NMR cells. Zr
              metallocenes prepared jointly by StanfordOs Waymouth group will be supported on
              silica or alumina with controlled dehydroxylation level. The initial steps of
              the stereoselective polymerization mechanism will be studied by characterizing
              in situ short chains of polypropylene. The microstructure and morphology of the
              polymers produced on the heterogeneous catalyst will be correlated with
              physical property determinations by WaymouthOs group. In another application of
              NMR, supported vanadia over alumina or complex K-promoted vanadia-tungsta over
              titania-alumina will be prepared and characterized. 17O, 51V, 29Si and 27Al NMR
              will be used to study the Mars-Van Krevelen-type oxygen insertion mechanism and
              oxygen and vanadium diffusion kinetics. The SCR of NOx with ammonia and the
              decomposition of CH3CH2Cl will be studied in situ with 13C, 15N, and 35Cl NMR.
              The modifications induced by potassium and its interactions with chemisorbates
              will be studied with 39K NMR. On the educational side, Prof. Klug will renew
              efforts to recruit minority, and will develop a new course in environmental
              catalysis for engineers for the multidisciplinary environmental sciences
              curriculum at Stanford.
