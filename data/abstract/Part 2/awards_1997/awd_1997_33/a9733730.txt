Abstract    :
              This project aims at the effective integration of databases, multimedia and the
              Internet for digital library applications. The research establishes an
              underlying framework and develops techniques for ensuring consistent and robust
              retrieval, transmission and presentation of multimedia data. The research plan
              involves: (1) customized presentation: develop principles to support consistent
              multimedia presentations based on quality of service specifications; (2)
              transmission: develop adaptive end-to-end control techniques to support
              transmission of multimedia data over networks; (3) retrieval: formulate a
              resource allocation model for a database server to allocate its resources for
              data retrieval; and (4) implementation and experimentation of a distributed
              multimedia database prototype for educational digital libraries. The
              educational component of the project focuses on two objectives: (1) development
              of new courses in the area of multimedia databases and digital libraries, and
              (2) application of the research to the establishment of a computer-assisted
              learning environment for asynchronous distance learning. The new courses and
              accompanying curriculum standards are designed to reflect the changing needs of
              computer professionals. Through the above research and educational activities,
              the fundamental understanding and novel techniques can be provided to support
              system development. The developed framework can be readily used to facilitate
              student tutoring, medical training, human resource development, and
              asynchronous distance learning. On a broader level, the methods and
              experimental results arising from this research will also guide the development
              of distributed multimedia database systems in industrial applications.
