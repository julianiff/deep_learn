Abstract    :
              Abstract    CMS 97-33948  PI:  Ismail Chabini  Massachusetts Institute of
              Technology  "CAREER:  High Performance Computing and Network  Optimization
              Methods with Applications to Intelligent  Transportation Systems"      This
              CAREER award supports research designed to integrate  methodologies in high
              performance computing and network  optimization methods to solve problems
              arising in  Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications.  The 
              research has three main directions:    1) developing and analyzing mathematical
              formulations,  efficient algorithms and computer implementations for  problems
              arising with ITS equipped with on-line information  and control technologies. 
              Problems include:  dynamic  modeling of the interactions between demand and
              supply  components; generation of consistent and anticipatory route  guidance;
              dynamic signal control and ramp metering and their  integration with dynamic
              traffic assignment; and development  of efficient algorithms for the
              computation of time-  dependent shortest paths.    2) expanding network
              optimization methods and the knowledge  base in the field of design and
              development of new  algorithms and their computer implementation and testing to
               solve very large scale real-life applications.  The emphasis  is on the
              development of new methods that are amenable to  efficient coarse grain
              parallel implementations.    3) developing high performance computing systems
              for  parallel implementations of dynamic transportation network  models and
              algorithms in order to meet the real-time  requirement of ITS; developing
              parallel optimization methods  to generate solutions to very large scale
              off-line real-life  applications; and developing mathematical measures to 
              analyze, assess and predict the performance of parallel  computing systems.   
              Education activities include:  contribution to the  development of a new
              curriculum and paradigm for the  education of future transportation
              professionals; innovation  in improving the learning and teaching experience b
              y  participating in the implementation of the concept of MIT  learning
              networks; contribution to a departmental initiative  that aims to develop a new
              curriculum for undergraduate  education; development of a textbook; outreach
              activities;  and transfer of research into practice.
