Abstract    :
              The increasing reliance on computers for virtually all  applications drives the
              need for provision of fault-  tolerance to prevent disruptions in the delivery
              of desired  services. However, approaches to fault-tolerance are  acceptable
              only if high costs and degradation in the system  performance is avoided. The
              checkpoint based fault recovery  schemes currently used are effective, but they
              necessitate  customized solutions and a high cost penalty, both  monetarily and
              in long recovery times.  A novel cache based  approach that provides for
              high-performance and low-cost  checkpointing based recovery in distributed
              systems will be  investigated. The principles of using caches for providing 
              stable checkpoints will be  established, and the  architectural concepts will
              be developed. The research  focuses on developing techniques to analyze and
              control the  cache attributes of stability and frequency of  checkpoints, and
              establishing response/overhead  characteristics. Protocols for cache based
              recovery (roll-  backward and roll-forward) over varied fault instances will 
              be developed and analyzed. This research will utilize  existing system caches
              in order to provide for automatic  checkpoint establishment and for a
              low-overhead fault  recovery approach which is explicitly transparent in use to
               the user/OS; thus a viable and effective fault tolerance  scheme for general
              computing systems will be developed.
