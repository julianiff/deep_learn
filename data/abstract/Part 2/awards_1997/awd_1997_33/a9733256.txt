Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of unprotected methods for  
              carbohydrate synthesis.  Coupling of aryl- and alkyl substitutes   propargyl
              halides with various unprotected carbohydrates, mediated by a   metal will be
              investigated using aqueous solvent.  The resulting products   will be
              transformed into C-glycosides without using   protection-deprotection
              processes.  The methodology will then be extended   to the syntheses of natural
              products, including: (+)-goniofufurone,   (+)-7-epigoniofurfurone,
              (+)-goniobutenolide A, (+)-goniodiol and the   main skeletons of papulacandin
              (A,B,C.D), chactiacandin, and   trachelospermum asiaticum.  The focus of the
              educational activities will   be the development of an undergraduate course
              entitled `The World of   Organic Chemistry: Food and Drugs.`  An outreach
              program targeting   elementary and high school students is also planned.  With
              this Faculty   Early Development (CAREER) award, the Organic and Macromolecular
                Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational activities   of
              Dr. Chao-Jun Li of the Department of Chemistry at Tulane University.    
              Professor Li will focus his research efforts on developing synthetic   methods
              for the preparation of carbohydrates without resorting to the   long
              protection-deprotection strategies that have been relied on in the   past.  The
              educational activities center around course development and   outreach.
