Abstract    :
              9733764  Longo  The research portion of this career program is aimed at  aiding
              in the design of bilayer systems including:  biosensors, pore-forming systems,
              drug delivery, and  antibiotics.  The ultimate goal is an understanding of how 
              to control the aggregation of membrane soluble molecules,  control disruption
              of bilayer systems, and influence the  function of membrane soluble molecules. 
              The teaching plans  incorporate two innovations:   (1) a High School Chemistry 
              Links Program; and (2) the development of a new course in  Biochemical
              Manufacturing Plant Design.  ***
