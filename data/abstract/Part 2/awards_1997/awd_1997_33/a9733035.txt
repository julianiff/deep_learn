Abstract    :
              9733035  Kumashiro  The PI will conduct modern high-resolution solid-state
              nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments to characterize the molecular
              structure of insoluble elastin.  Initially, secondary structural elements and
              the crosslinking moeities will be identified by 13C and 15N chemical shift
              measurements, respectively.  Solid-state NMR experiments will then be used to
              ascertain the effect of different sample conditions, to probe the
              intramolecular interactions at work.  In addition, elastin from normal and
              transgenic mice will be studied.  The differences in NMR spectra will be
              indicative of the relationships between molecular structure and normal
              physiological function. Finally, model peptide systems related to elastin will
              be studied.  Insoluble elastin is responsible for the elasticity in
              physiological structures in mammals, like blood vessels, ligaments, and skin. 
              However, a fundamental understanding of the molecular basis of elasticity is
              weak, due to the lack of high-resolution structural data that is presently
              available.  This work will focus on the elucidation of structural information
              on normal and defective elastin, as well as the peptides thought to be model
              systems for this protein.  The data gathered on these systems will then be used
              to gain insight into the structure-property relationships of elastin.  This
              research is highly interdisciplinary, drawing on topics as diverse as
              solid-state NMR to molecular biology; with this philosophy in mind, a modern
              learning environment for graduate and undergraduate students, both in the
              classroom and in the laboratory, will be provided.
