Abstract    :
              Flora  9733377  This is an award to support a project proposed in accord with
              the  Guidelines for Submission of Proposals to the Faculty Early  Career
              Development (CAREER) Program, NSF 97-87.  The Principal  Investigator's
              research goal is to study the potential use of  bioelectrochemical systems for
              treatment of polluted water.  His  objectives are to obtain the engineering
              design parameters that  would provide guidance to engineers in design of
              processes and  systems utilizing these bioelectrochemical systems for treatment
               of surface and groundwaters.  The research proposed is a renewal  of work that
              was started under NSF's Research Initiation Award  No. 94-10486.    In accord
              with NSF 97-87, the Principal Investigator plans on  involving undergraduate
              students in the conduct of his research.  His plan for revising the
              undergraduate laboratory used for  environmental engineering instruction is to
              structure it to  provide opportunities for discovery and creativity by students
               rather than specifying the performance of rigid laboratory  exercises
              consisting of experiments that are performed, data  recorded and ended with a
              laboratory report.  He plans to  coordinate the laboratory experiences of
              students with lectures  and classwork that will include addressing field-scale
              problems.  ***
