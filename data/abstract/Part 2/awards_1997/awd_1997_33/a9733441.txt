Abstract    :
                  9733441  Graham    The  research  component of this CAREER award  focuses 
              on  large  jellyfish as voracious predators of zooplankton, larval fish  and 
              fish   eggs  in  the  northern  Gulf  of  Mexico.   Physiological  limitations 
              of jellyfish production rates are set  by  energetic  balance  as  individual 
              medusae  encounter,  and  move  between,  patches  of  concentrated food.  The
              aim of this research  is  to  understand  possible  limitations  to  jellyfish 
              production   in  coastal  ecosystems  in  the context of prey  productivity, 
              prey  patch distribution, and medusa behavior.  To accomplish this,  an 
              individual-based  energetics model will be  constructed  for  key  jellyfish 
              species  of  the northern Gulf  of  Mexico  (primarliy  Aurelia  aurita).  The
              model will incorporate in  situ-determined  behavior  as an adaptation for
              enhanced foraging, and  laboratory  and field-based characterization of the
              jellyfish energetics.   A  series of planned research cruises in the northern
              Gulf of Mexico  will  be  used  to refine the energetic parameters under 
              natural  feeding  conditions and to test the model's predictive  capacity. 
              Educational  and outreach components of this CAREER  program  are  broadly 
              targeted  at all ages. These include a `K-12  Discovery'  component  focussing 
              on  high-school  teacher  training  in  the  scientific  process,  a minority
              undergraduate  summer  mentoring  program, and a public outreach display at the
              Dauphin Island  Sea  Lab's  new  educational  `Estuarium'  illustrating  the 
              role  of  gelatinous zooplankton in structuring marine food webs.
