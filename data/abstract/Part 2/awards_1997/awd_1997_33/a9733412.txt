Abstract    :
              This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award in the Inorganic,  
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research and  
              education on phosphorus chemistry by Dr. John D. Protasiewicz  in the  
              Chemistry Department, Case Western University.  The focus of the project   is
              synthesizing  multiply bonded phosphorus compounds, specifically for   the
              purpose of utilizing the reactivity of these species for development   of
              catalysts and materials.  Specific targets for synthesis are   diphospenes and
              polymers having two or more PX(X=C,N,P) multiply-bonded   sites.  The mechanism
              of formation of these compounds would also be   investigated.  Educational
              efforts would concentrate on development of a   project-based thematic
              undergraduate laboratory course.   As part of the   research-based,
              team-oriented approach, students would be introduced to   computer uses in
              literature searching, data storage and analysis, and   molecular modeling. 
              Extensive use is made of Internet capabilities.  Polymeric materials have wide
              utility in molecular devices and materials.    This research is aimed at 
              finding more effective routes to polymeric   materials that contain phosphorus,
              potentially widening the range of   properties currently available in
              materials.  The research is integrated   with undergraduate education not only
              in specific research projects but   in `discovery-based` laboratory courses.
