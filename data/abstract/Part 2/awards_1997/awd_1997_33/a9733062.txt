Abstract    :
                9733062  Hommerich    This CAREER project aims at a comprehensive
              investigation of  chromium doped II-VI semiconductors for tunable solid-state
              laser  applications in the mid-infrared wavelength region. Synthesis of 
              materials will be carried out in an ongoing collaboration with  researchers at
              Brimrose Corporation of America. Materials will be  optically characterized by
              spectral luminescence studies,  luminescence excitation and decay time
              measurements, optical  absorption, and laser performance studies over the
              temperature  range 15 - 450 K. Spectroscopic results will be modeled within 
              the framework of crystal field theory to derive crystal field  strength
              parameters, electron-phonon coupling strengths, and  luminescence quenching
              activation energies. The results of the  modeling will be used to derive
              structure/property relations  which can guide the optimization of selected
              materials to achieve  better laser performance. Educational components include:
              a new  course in optical spectroscopy and new experiments for an  advanced
              graduate laboratory; and activities to increase student  participation in
              research from K-12 through the graduate level.  This project aims to increase
              the skilled work force in an  important field of optoelectronics with a special
              emphasis on  enhancing the participation of underrepresented students.  %%% 
              The project addresses research and education issues in a topical  area of
              materials science having high technological relevance.  The research will
              contribute basic materials science knowledge at  a fundamental level to
              photonic materials. An important feature  of the program is the emphasis on
              education, and on the  integration of research and education through the
              training of  students in a fundamentally and technologically significant 
              research area with a special emphasis on participation of  underrepresented
              students.  ***
