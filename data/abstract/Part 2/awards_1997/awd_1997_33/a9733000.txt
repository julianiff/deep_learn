Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program supports a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant to Dr.  
              Claudia Turro of the Chemistry Department, Ohio State University.  The   goal
              of the research is to determine the role of electrostatic effects on  
              electron-transfer reactions. The surface potentials of micelles  
              (macromolecules) will be tuned by varying the composition of the micelles  
              using cationic, neutral, or anionic detergents.  The rate of electron  
              transfer will then be measured as a function of micellar potential.    Attempts
              will also be made to use electrostatic fields to control   directionality of
              electron transfer.  The excited-state electron donors   will be well-known
              neutral ruthenium(II) compounds so that the decrease   of the steady-state
              luminescence and emission lifetime of their   metal-ligand charge transfer
              states can be used to obtain   electron-transfer rates.   The acceptors will be
              viologen and   pyridine-based species that have been incorporated into the
              micelle   surface synthetically.  In addition to teaching undergraduate
              chemistry   courses, Dr. Turro is actively involved with mentoring women and
              minority   students in science.  Electron transfer is an important process in
              biological systems and in   materials, and it is possible that charged groups
              within the large   molecular structure could have an impact on the path and on
              the time   required for electron movement.  In this research, the influence of 
               external electric field effects on the rate and direction of electron  
              transfer will be studied.  Dr. Turro will serve as a mentor to women and  
              minority students at Ohio State University.
