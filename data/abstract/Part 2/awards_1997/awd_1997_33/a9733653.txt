Abstract    :
              Nanomechanics is employed to characterize the nonlinear  thermo-mechanical
              properties of sculptured thin films. Also,  a homogenization theory of
              sculptured thin films is  formulated to analytically and computationally derive
              the  effective constitutive and evolution equations of these nano-  engineered
              systems. Software and computer-based courseware  is developed to simulate the
              experimental activity used in  the identification of the thermo-mechanical
              properties of  homogeneous as well as composite materials. The project 
              contributes to the improvement of fabrication and life  prediction techniques
              for a new class of composite thin  films with promising applications on
              electroluminescent  devices, optical sensor technology, micro-sieves for 
              entrapment of viruses or for growth of biological tissues on  surfaces of
              biological and on-biological origin.
