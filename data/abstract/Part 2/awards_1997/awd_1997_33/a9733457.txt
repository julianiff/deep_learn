Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is a combination of experimental and   computational
              studies of carbonyl reactivity.  Variable temperature   flowing afterglow
              (VT-FA) measurements coupled with high level ab initio   calculations will be
              used to probe the reactivity of a variety of   carbonyl groups towards
              nucleophilic attack.  Furthermore, the study will   explore solvent effects in
              these reactions under microsolvation   conditions.   As a  major focus of the
              educational activities, the use of   the internet as an important adjunct to
              the teaching of undergraduate   organic chemistry will be developed.  With this
              Faculty Early Development   (CAREER) award, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program is   supporting the research and educational activities of
              Dr. Christopher M.   Hadad of the Department of Chemistry at Ohio State
              University.     Professor Hadad  will focus his research efforts on studying
              the   fundamental requirements for reactivity at carbonyl (C=O) groups to  
              assess the importance of the leaving group, the electronic requirement of   the
              carbonyl carbon and the effect of solvent (water) on these reactions.   
              Carbonyl groups are fundamentally important in organic chemistry as well   as
              in biological systems.  For example, they are central to a variety of   enzyme
              functions under aqueous conditions.  The educational focus of the   award
              centers on the use of the internet in curriculum development
