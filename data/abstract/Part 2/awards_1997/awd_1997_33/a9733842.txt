Abstract    :
              This research seeks to provide a new framework to support  distributed programs
              that access large amounts of data  stored across millions of servers.  The
              framework consists  of two parts: a set of extensible modules to provide basic 
              system services plus higher-level policies built on top of  these modules to
              coordinate distributed data access.  This  research leverages this framework in
              the context of four key  subsystems: (1) dynamic data replication to improve 
              performance, improve reliability, and reduce the need for  human management of
              storage, (2) extensible and scalable  data consistency to coordinate data
              access across multiple  nodes, (3) scalable location services for mobile
              objects to  track where objects are stored in the dynamic replication 
              framework, and (4) market-based distributed resource  management to balance
              large numbers of applications  competing for limited system resources.  The
              impact of this  research will be a better understanding of the fundamental 
              mechanisms required by large-scale data systems and a set of  techniques that
              will support new classes of data-intensive  applications in this challenging
              environment.  This project  also places a heavy emphasis on modernizing the
              teaching of  operating systems and distributed systems to give students  the
              skills and experience they need to understand and build  large-scale
              distributed systems.
