Abstract    :
              Our Sun's corona, a tenuous, hot atmosphere above the visible surface of the
              sun, is the most dramatic, variable component of solar activity.  The PI
              develops a global model of a complex, evolving corona, based on the hypothesis
              that coronal activity results from surface motions stressing its magnetic
              field.  Numerical implementation of the model, applied to observations of
              coronal evolution, tests this hypothesis.  Statistical studies of the model
              provide quantitative estimates for flaring frequency/amplitude, distribution of
              coronal loop lengths, and total heat supplied by magnetic stressing.    The PI
              is also developing a computational physics curriculum for undergraduates,
              allowing students to participate more fully in departmental research.
