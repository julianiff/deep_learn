                                      LAY ABSTRACT    Principal Investigator:  Gordon, Andrew 
              Proposal Number:    IBN-97332679    The objective of this Faculty Early Career
              Development  (CAREER) project is to understand how sensory information is  used
              for the planning and control of hand movement.  Professor Gordon and his
              students employ state-of-the-art  techniques which allow precise measurement of
              hand and  finger movements and forces during tasks such as typing,  reaching
              and grasping.  They study how tactile information  contributes to the
              sequencing of movements (typing), how  these sequences are learned, and the
              coordination between  hand and eye movement during typing.  They also study the
               contribution of tactile information to the regulation of  fingertip forces
              during object manipulation and how tactile  cues may provide information about
              the location of the limb  in space.  These studies provide insight into the
              nature of  learning and organization of movement in the brain.  The 
              educational component of this CAREER project beyond  involvement of students in
              this research is to form an  interdepartmental cooperation with the Program in
              Science  Education.  This enhances teacher preparation by introducing  Science
              Education doctoral students to research in systems  neuroscience.  Professor
              Gordon engages these students in  research which foster an understanding of the
              methodology  and rationale of science in order to facilitate exploration  of
              the nature of science and scientific inquiry in the  classroom and improve the
              learning process through the  process of discovery.
