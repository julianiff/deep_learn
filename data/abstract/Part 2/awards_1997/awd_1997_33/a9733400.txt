Abstract    :
              This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported in the  
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focuses on the use of new  
              technology developed by Professor Liu and her students at Wayne State  
              University to very precisely modify surfaces incorporating self-assembled  
              monolayers.  Modification methods are being developed to allow the study   of
              biorecognition processes and to use their specificity to develop new   types of
              chemical sensors on very small (sub-micrometer) scales.  This   CAREER research
              project also involves the introduction of new surface   chemistry courses and
              laboratories into the graduate and undergraduate   curricula.  Participation in
              a novel `Smart Sensor and Intelligent   Devices`course by Professor Liu and her
              students will enhance the   possible outcomes of this sort of interdisciplinary
              research.   The integration of advanced materials processing methods and the  
              expanding field of molecular biology has broadranging implications.   
              Professor Liu and her students at Wayne State University have developed  
              microfabrication methodologies which hold great promise for the assembly   of
              devices which allow for the study of biorecognition processes which   can be
              further utilized for the creation of sensor devices of extremely   high
              specificity.  The outcome of such research can be envisioned to   extend to a
              new generation of environmental and biological monitors.    Professor Liu
              extends the interdisciplinary nature of sensor development   program to the
              graduate and undergraduate curricula to introduce her   students to new ways of
              thinking about chemical research.
