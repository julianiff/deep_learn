Abstract    :
              This research and teaching program involves the investigation of the
              relationships between information technology (IT) investments and
              organizational practices and the implications of these relationships for
              organizational performance.   Drawing on prior work on the economics of
              organizations and the economic theory of production, formal empirical models
              are developed that identify specific sets of work practices and organizational
              structures that are complementary to IT investments.   These models are then
              tested by combining existing secondary data sources with an extensive program
              of data collection on work organization, workforce characteristics and
              organizational structure from individual firms.   The results of this program
              will enable managers and technologists to identify the appropriate
              organizational changes that should accompany the implementation of computer
              systems, improve the general understanding of how information technology
              influences economic performance, and inform teaching of information technology
              management.    http://grace.wharton.upenn.edu/~lhitt/
