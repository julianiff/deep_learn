The proposed 1997 NEHRP (National Earthquake Hazard 
              Reduction Program) Provisions for seismic regulations of new  buildings and
              other structures (BSSSC-1997), show marked  improvement in trying to define, in
              the design process, the  performance levels of structures during earthquakes. 
              Performance levels are expressed in terms of allowable  damage to structural
              and non-structural components, with the  intention of providing definite
              margins of safety.  Three  performance levels are considered, including
              Immediate  Occupancy, Life Safety, and Collapse Prevention.  Although  the
              guidelines represent a significant advance in the  practice of seismic
              engineering, calibration of the analysis  procedures and acceptance criteria
              for actual building  performance is clearly needed.  The objectives of this
              CAREER Development Program are to:  (a) Evaluate and compare the design of
              various lateral force  resisting structural systems according to the proposed
              1997  NEHRP Recommend Provisions for Seismic Regulations for New  Buildings &
              Other Structures; (b) Evaluate and compare their  performance-based response
              during various levels of seismic  excitation using nonlinear time history
              dynamic analyses;  and (c) enhance an existing graduate course in Civil 
              Engineering at Texas A&M and develop a short-course for  students, researchers,
              and practicing engineers from the  United States and Mexico which will
              emphasize performance-  based design of seismic force resisting structural
              systems.  The impact of the project will be recognized by providing 
              probabilities of occurrence for various performance levels  of several types of
              structural systems due to earthquakes of  varying intensities.  Therefore,
              given performance based-  design objectives for a structural systems during 
              earthquakes  of varying intensities, the lateral load  resisting mechanism can
              be selected for optimal performance.  In addition, given an existing structural
              system designed  according to previous building codes, the ex pected 
              performance level under various earthquake intensities can  be identified and
              the need for seismic retrofit can be  determined.
