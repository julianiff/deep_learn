Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is in the area of electron transfer catalysis.    A
              combination of computational and experimental methods will be used to   study
              electrocyclic reactions, electron transfer catalyzed   vinycyclopropane
              rearrangements and the radical cation Bergman   cyclization.  The educational
              focus will consist of the development of a   course entitled `Computers in
              Chemistry.`  The course links computational   chemistry to practical
              applications and involves industrial participants.    With this Faculty Early
              Development (CAREER) award, the Organic and   Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              is supporting the research and   educational activities of Dr. Olaf G. Wiest of
              the Department of   Chemistry at the University of Notre Dame.   Professor
              Wiest will focus   his research efforts on the area of electron transfer
              catalysis.  A   combination of computational and experimental techniques will
              help in   understanding the role of radical cations in electrocyclic reactions,
              an   important class of organic transformations.  The educational activities  
              will focus on the interface between theory and experiment and stresses  
              computational chemistry at the undergraduate and graduate level
