              -----------------  --------------  Abstract: CMS-9733113, Jonathan Stewart,
              UCLA    Recent improvements in seismological source modeling, in the  analysis
              of  travel path effects, and in the characterization of local site  effects on 
              strong ground shaking, have led to significant advances in both  code-based 
              and more advanced procedures for evaluating earthquake ground  motions. 
              Concurrently, seismic structural design practice is evolving  towards 
              consideration of performance-based criteria, which provide more  reliable 
              representations of structural behavior during earthquakes. A  missing link, 
              however, is empirically verified design procedures for assessing  the  effects
              of soil-structure interaction (SSI) on both the strong  motions  transmitted to
              structures and the structural response to these  motions.  Fortuitously, a
              significant amount of strong motion data has  become  available over the last
              decade which affords the opportunity to  obtain this  empirical verification. 
              This is the objective of this CAREER  project.    The research component of
              this project utilizes strong motion data  in  system identification analyses to
              evaluate the effects of inertial  and  kinematic interaction on the seismic
              response of buildings through  more  fundamental representations of SSI; namely
              impedance and transfer  functions. These empirical results are compiled from
              analyses of  data  having suitable combinations of structural and free-field
              strong  motion  recordings. Empirical results derived from strong motion data
              are  combined  with data from forced vibration testing of structures and
              results  of  numerical analyses to develop a framework for understanding the 
              factors  influencing impedance and transfer functions. These results will 
              elucidate  several important sources o f uncertainty in SSI analysis 
              procedures, such  as the modeling of non-uniform site conditions, and the
              effects of  foundation embedment and/or deep foundation elements (i.e. piles 
              and piers)  on foundation performance.    The educational component of this
              project seeks to improve the  teaching of  earthquake engineering at UCLA, to
              enhance knowledge transfer to  practicing  engineers, and to encourage
              pre-college students to pursue careers  in  science and technology. The
              teaching of earthquake- and  geotechnical-engineering at UCLA is improved at
              the undergraduate  and  graduate levels through curriculum reform (including
              the addition  of new  courses), and the utilization of an instructional style
              which  blends  fundamental theory with "field" data and practical design 
              problems.  Knowledge transfer to practicing engineers is facilitated through 
              continuing  education workshops and service on professional committees. 
              Outreach to  pre-college students consists of lectures and demonstrations in 
              local  middle- and high-school science classes. The research plan  compliments
              these  educational objectives by providing "field" data that can be  utilized
              in  classroom instruction.    These unified educational and research plans
              reflect the  philosophy that  research and teaching of complex seismic and
              geotechnical  phenomena must  blend sound physical principles with well
              documented field  performance data  in order to gain insight into a problem.
