Abstract    :
              9733207  Kang  Protein C (PC) is an important blood plasma protein which 
              prevents unwanted clots and also dissolves formed clots in  the human body. 
              With PC deficiency, either by hereditary or  acquired, the human body can
              encounter serious medical  complications due to blood  coagulation that can
              lead to embolisms that injure lung,  heart, and brain tissue, and can cause
              death.  A practical,  clinical PC biosensor for the diagnosis of PC deficiency 
              should have the attributes of high sensitivity, high  specificity, and
              real-time measurement.  The proposed  mechanism depends on a highly specific
              antigen-antibody  reaction.  It involves binding antibodies at the surface of 
              an optical fiber, injection of the sample into a micro  chamber (300 micro
              liter) encasing the fiber, reacting light  emitting secondary antibodies with
              the absorbed PC molecules  on the fiber, and quantifying the PC concentration
              by the  emitted light intensity.  It is proposed to apply total  quality
              management (TQM) concepts in both graduate and  undergraduate bioengineering
              education and research.  This  project emphasizes the structured team approach
              to bring  together basic scientists, bioengineers (biomedical and  bioprocess
              engineers), clinicians, business, and legal  professionals to address optimum
              process development for the  production of the best bioproduct at minimum cost.
