Abstract    :
              Our  most  successful Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)  systems  remain  too 
              tied to specific domains (`air travel' or  `business  news')  and  to 
              carefully pronounced, slow speech,  because  our  statistical  algorithms  do 
              not  deal  well  with  the   extreme  variation,  in  pronunciation, 
              word-choice,  and  grammar,  that  characterizes natural, conversational,
              speech.  The research goal  of  this CAREER project is to build better speech
              recognizers  by  taking  human psychological results on lexical processing,
              giving  them explicit probabilistic models, and integrating them into ASR 
              algorithms.   This  project is incorporating  part-of-speech  and  word
              frequency into probabilistic models of word pronunciation in  ASR.   This
              project is using distributional-vector models of word  meaning  in an ASR
              system to increase the probability of  a  word  occurring    near   similar  
              words,   compiling    probabilistic  dictionaries of verb-argument structure to
              help ASR systems.  The  educational  goal of this CAREER investigation is to 
              incorporate  computational, corpus-based, and probabilistic training into  the 
              undergraduate    and    graduate   curriculum    in    phonetics, 
              psycholinguistics,  computational  linguistics,   and   cognitive  science. 
              Through its research and educational facets, the CAREER  project  will help
              draw talented and knowledgeable linguists  and  psychologists  into ASR and
              related fields, and produce  research  with  a  direct  impact on ASR and its
              technical  and  commercial  implications.
