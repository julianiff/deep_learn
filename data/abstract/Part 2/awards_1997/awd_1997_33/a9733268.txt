Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9733268   Randall Q. Snurr/ Northwestern U.     This grant is
              awarded through the  Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the
              Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The principal investigator is  Dr.
              Randall Snurr at Northwestern University. The objectives of the project are (1)
              to develop a research and educational program in the area of applied molecular
              modeling for engineering design (2) to use molecular modeling together with
              experiment to determine the role of molecular segregation in adsorption
              thermodynamics and transport in molecular sieves. The elucidation of molecular
              segregation in adsorbed systems is a focus of the research effort, and
              molecular simulation will be used to determine why segregation occurs and how
              it affects diffusion and adsorption characteristics in zeolites. The
              educational plans address the development of graduate courses, the development
              of  short modules introducing molecular concepts to the undergraduate
              curriculum and providing continuing education opportunities on molecular
              modeling and computational chemistry.     The chemical process industries face
              several challenges in tailoring products and processes to meet the demands for
              improved economics and environmental friendliness. These challenges require
              design at the molecular level for the next generation of materials for chemical
              separations and reaction. Molecular modeling is a tool that can deliver an
              understanding of molecular-level phenomena and the link between microscopic and
              macroscopic properties. The molecular understanding provided by modeling can
              lead to new and improved chemical processes.
