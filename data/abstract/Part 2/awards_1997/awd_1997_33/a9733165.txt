Abstract    :
              This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported in the  
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focuses on the detailed  
              microscopic, macroscopic, and computational characterization of etched  
              silicon surfaces.  In particular, the use of a new class of aqueous,  
              fluorine-based etchants will be investigated.  Professor Hines and her  
              students at Cornell University will employ scanning tunneling microscopy   to
              study the physical structure (quality) of the resultant etch patterns   while
              etch rate measurements will give evidence of the kinetics of the   process. 
              Monte Carlo calculations will be incorporated to help simulate   the observed
              chemistry.  This CAREER project will improve the   computational skills of
              undergraduates and graduates through the   implementation of a `Numerical
              Analysis for Chemists` course.  Professor   Hines will also improve students'
              readiness for the workforce through   seminars in writing and public speaking
              skills.  The study and development of new chemistries which can be applied to  
              semiconductor processing systems continues to be a very vibrant area of  
              research.  Professor Hines and her students at Cornell University are  
              combining physical measurement techniques and computational simulations   to
              evaluate the use of a new family of aqueous, fluorine-based etchants.   
              Previous studies have suggested that atomically flat silicon surfaces   could
              be produced by these methods.  This CAREER project holds the   promise of
              producing results of substantial technological importance.    Professor Hines
              will enhance the development of scientists with skills in   the important area
              of computational chemistry through the introduction of   a new
              undergraduate/graduate student course in that area.  Technical   writing and
              public speaking skills will be developed through topical   seminars and
              coursework.
