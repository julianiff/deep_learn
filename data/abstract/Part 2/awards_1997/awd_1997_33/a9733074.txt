Abstract    :
              9733074  Wade    Males and females are different.  Most species, including
              humans, are sexually dimorphic.  While body shape and size may be the most
              apparent, there are differences in physiology, neural function and behavior. 
              Considerable evidence indicates that, in vertebrates, hormones secreted by the
              gonads during a limited, sensitive stage of development differentiate the
              neural substrates underlying sexual dimorphism.  Several model systems have
              been developed to exploit the relationship between gonadal steroid hormones,
              brain structure, and sexually dimorphic behavior including bird song, rat
              reproductive behavior, and  electric discharge patterns of weakly electric
              fish.  Dr. Wade has developed a reptile model system to examine how structural
              and biochemical changes within the brain regulate behavior.  Reptiles are a
              pivotal group in vertebrate evolution since they are direct ancestors to both
              mammals and birds.  Using a variety of neuroanatomical, behavioral, and
              classical endocrine techniques, she will address what causes behaviors to be
              different in males than in females and decipher the factors that stimulate
              behaviors seasonally in adulthood.  Moreover, as part of this CAREER award, Dr.
              Wade will develop a course emphasizing comparative aspects of neuroanatomical
              and hormonal regulation of behaviors.  The integration of her teaching and
              research will provide students with a greater opportunity for first-hand
              experience in the neural and endocrine factors that influence the structure and
              the function of the brain.
