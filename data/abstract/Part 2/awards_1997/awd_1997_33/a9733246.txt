Abstract    :
              Data security and cryptography are growing concerns for the  rapidly expanding
              information infrastructure.  This project  treats this emerging engineering
              discipline with a  systematic exploration of the use of  reconfigurable
              hardware.  The research in this project will:  develop arithmetic architectures
              for public-key algorithms  on reconfigurable hardware;  classify private-key
              algorithms  according to the kernel functions needed in their  implementation; 
              establish a public-domain VHDL library of  algorithms for both public and
              private key cryptosystems;  and develop a board-level reconfigurable device for
               implementation of cryptographic algorithms.  Educational  activities will
              include development of material for teaching  cryptography to beginning
              graduate students, inclusion of  VHDL design projects in the undergraduate
              curriculum, and an  exchange program for graduate students with a cryptography 
              research group in Germany.
