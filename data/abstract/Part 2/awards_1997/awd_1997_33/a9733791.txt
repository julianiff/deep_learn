The atomic nuclei consists of nucleons (neutrons and
              protons); these are bound together by a delicate balance of strong, short-range
              repulsive forces and longer-range but weaker attractive forces, which operate
              between pairs of nucleons.  The attractive forces are exhibited in many
              well-studied nuclear phenomena, but the repulsive short-range forces have
              proved elusive and have only been studied indirectly in nuclei.
The research
              carried out under this grant is aimed at studying nuclear reactions, initiated
              by electron-beam bombardment, which are explicitly sensitive to the short-range
              repulsive
forces between the nucleons.  The mechanism by which these nuclear
              reactions proceed will also be studied, since these reactions occur with very
              small probability and are therefore sensitive
to other, multiple-step
              reactions which can occur.  Some of these multiple-step reactions are
              interesting in their own right anyway, since they depend on the quark structure
              of nucleons, and quarks
are the ultimate fundamental particles from which
              neutrons, protons, mesons and nuclei are made.
