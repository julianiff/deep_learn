Abstract    :
              Werth  9733428  This is an award to support a project proposed in accord the
              with  Guidelines for Submission of Proposals to the Faculty Early  Career
              Development (CAREER) Program, NSF 97-87.  The Principal  Investigator's
              objectives are to conduct research that will  assist in determining the effects
              of interstitial water velocity,  pore and nonaqueous phase liquid properties on
              the  characteristics of the effective interfacial region between  nonaqueous
              phase liquids and groundwater, and predict time-  dependent dissolution of
              nonaqueous phase liquids in natural  porous groundwater aquifers.  He plans on
              using magnetic  resonance imaging to visualize local interstitial velocities, 
              pore dimensions and other behavior characteristics of the  interfaces between
              nonaqueous phase liquids and water to  elucidate the mechanisms controlling
              dissolution of nonaqueous  phase liquids.    In accord with NSF 97-87, the
              Principal Investigator plans on  integrating the results of his research into
              classroom  instruction using interactive simulation models and case studies. 
              This approach is expected to significantly hasten the transfer of  the results
              of his research from the classroom setting to  consideration of its use in
              engineering design and implementation  of systems for solving relevant
              "real-world" hazardous waste  management problems.  ***
