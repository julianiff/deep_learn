Abstract    :
              The primary goal of this CAREER project is to develop piezoelectric actuators
              with high control capability and implement them in building structures.  These
              actuators are a piezoelectric wedge actuator, a piezoelectrically-driven
              friction damper, and a shear-mode piezoelectric actuator.  A truss mechanism is
              introduced to further amplify the control force from the actuators.  

The
              project consists of design and fabrication of the three actuators, their
              modeling and tests, and their integration into a 1/4-scale steel frame
              structure.  Analytical models of the structure and actuators will be
              established and experimentally verified in a laboratory.  Effectiveness of
              these actuators is measured by the reduction of peak displacement/acceleration
              responses of the structure when subjected to earthquake ground motion.  For all
              actuators, simple but robust control algorithms with local deformation and
              force (acceleration) feedback will be developed.  Coordinated interdisciplinary
              collaboration and industry participation are emphasized.  The research results
              will be implemented into two recently-developed graduate courses on smart
              structures and disseminated to professional engineers by delivering in-house
              presentations in several pioneer consulting firms.  A small-scale, two-story
              plastic frame is designed and manufactured for demonstration to K-12 students
              and senior undergraduates to stimulate their interest in structural control and
              prepare them for higher education.  

This is a FY98 CAREER award.
