Abstract    :
              9733410  Shin  Protein recognition of specific sequences of duplex DNA is an
              essential step in numerous biological processes.  Understanding the
              determinants of this binding specificity is one of the central challenges in
              the study of protein-DNA interactions. Examination of how a dimer of
              alpha-helices  interacts with short DNA duplexes promises to be a tractable,
              informative strategy to dissect the complex  mechanism employed by full
              proteins.  To this end, an alpha-helical protein dimer has been synthesized and
              attached to a column that is utilized to select specific binding sites from a
              random DNA library.  Quantitative information about selected protein-DNA
              complexes will be gained through a multi-pronged approach involving
              thermodynamic, kinetic, and structural analyses in conjunction with
              computational modeling.  This quantitative information about  alpha-helix
              recognition of the major groove will provide a tool for prediction and design
              of bZIP-based proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences.  Ultimately, the
              goal is to achieve a deeper quantitative understanding of the energetics of
              bZIP-DNA complexation, and to propel further research into the global field of
              understanding specificity in protein-DNA interactions, especially those
              involving larger, more complicated systems.
