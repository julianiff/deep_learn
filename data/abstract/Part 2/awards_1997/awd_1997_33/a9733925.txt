              -----------------  --------------  Abstract: CMS-9733925, Kaye Brubaker, U.
              Maryland    In regions with significant seasonal snowpacks, some of the most 
              devastating floods are caused by sudden snowmelt or rain-on-snow  events. At 
              the other hydrologic extreme, a below-average winter snowpack is  likely to 
              translate into severe warm-season water shortages. In the United  States, 
              operational hydrology has made great strides in short-term and  extended 
              forecasting of these disastrous events, aided by sophisticated  observations 
              and models. Modern hydrologic techniques can incorporate  information on 
              uncertainty in the snow pack, precipitation and other weather  factors to 
              produce probabilistic forecasts.  The aim of this CAREER project  is to 
              develop tools to determine mathematical expressions for physical  variability
              and measurement uncertainty, for a variety of  topographic  climatic
              situations, and for different resolutions of measurement.    The research
              objectives are:  * Characterize patterns in snowpack/snow-cover depletion
              during  the melt  season using remote-sensing products at different spatial 
              resolutions, and  a Geographic Information System;  * Relate these
              spatio-temporal patterns to topography, land cover,  and climate;  *
              Investigate the scaling properties of these patterns and their  dependence  on
              the resolution of the observed data; and  * Test the use and value of these
              findings in short-term and  extended  streamflow forecasting models, both
              deterministic and  probabilistic.    It is expected that this research will
              result in:  * Physically-based mathematical expressions for uncertainty in 
              snow-water  equivalent estimates used to update streamflow forecast models.  *
              Model validation data sets of spatially-distributed time-series  of  multi-se
              nsor snow-cover and weather observations, and weather  forecasts for  testing
              and developing forecast models.    The educational objectives are:  * Develop a
              new hands-on seminar in hydrologic prediction, design  and  forecasting,
              incorporating the research results.  * Incorporate the research findings into a
              modest number of new  modules for  an existing graduate hydrology class and an
              existing undergraduate  probability and statistics class. The new modules will
              incorporate  innovative classroom technology and pedagogy.  * Perform objective
              and subjective assessments of the value of  these  innovations in aiding
              students' learning.    It is expected that this educational objective for
              water-resource  engineers  will result in training in the use of sophisticated
              observational  and  analytical technology, including remotely-sensed Earth
              systems  data, and  Geographic Information Systems and spatial data
              manipulation; a  solid  understanding of natural variability in hydrologic
              variables,  measurement  uncertainty, mathematical expressions for that
              variability and  uncertainty,  and the implications for resource prediction and
              forecasting; and  exposure  to techniques and perspectives from related
              disciplines.
