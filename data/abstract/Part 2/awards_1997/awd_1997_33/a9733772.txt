Abstract    :
                   This CAREER award will support a four year program of  research and
              teaching activities.  The research will address  the issues of the contribution
              of the strange quark sea to  low energy nucleon properties and the origin of CP
               violation.  The strange quark sea contributions will be  measured using
              parity-violating electron scattering of  polarized electrons from nuclei. 
              Experiments will be  carried out at the MIT-Bates Linear Accelerator Center (on
               the proton and deuteron) and at the Thomas Jefferson  National Accelerator
              Center (on the helium nucleus).  These  experiments will result in a
              determination of the strange  quark sea contribution to the magnetic moment and
              electric  form factor of the proton.  The origin of CP violation will  be
              probed through the measurement of the branching ratio of  a rare kaon decay to
              be carried out at the Brookhaven  National Laboratory.  The teaching aspect of
              this proposal  includes the development and incorporation of learning  modules
              using mathematical symbolic manipulation software  into several physics classes
              at the advanced undergraduate  level.  Postdoctoral fellows and graduate
              students will be  educated through active contribution to the research 
              projects funded by this award.
