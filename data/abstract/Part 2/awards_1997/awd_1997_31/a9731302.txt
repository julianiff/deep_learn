Abstract    :
                  Mathieu, Robert  AST  97-31302      Dr. Mathieu will carry out a program of
              high-precision radial velocity surveys of 4 key open clusters spanning a range
              of ages and metallicities.  The surveys will provide a complete census of short
              period binary populations in these clusters, which will allow the PI to address
              a wide variety of issues in stellar astrophysics and cluster dynamics.  The PI
              will make use of the WIYN telescope using its multi-object spectrograph in the
              survey.  This radial velocity study is a component of the WIYN Open Cluster
              Study (WOCS), a project to carry out comprehensive photometric, spectroscopic
              and astrometric studies of a select set of open clusters, and provides both
              supporting data for later investigations and samples for immediate analysis. 
              Among the issues the survey will address are : the nature of binary populations
              within these clusters, including the possible evolution of binary frequency
              with age and measures of main-sequence tidal circularization rates, dynamical
              evolution and mass segregation in clusters, the effect binarity has on stellar
              angular momentum evolution and internal mixing through its manifestation in
              light element abundances, and tests of stellar evolution theory through
              analysis of cluster color-magnitude diagrams free of field star contamination
              and binary members.    ***
