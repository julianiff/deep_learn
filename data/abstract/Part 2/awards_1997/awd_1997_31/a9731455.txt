Abstract    :
              9731455  LEWIS   This project will supply shipboard scientific support equipment
              for the research vessel CAPE HATTERAS, an NSF-owned research vessel, operated
              by the Duke University Marine Laboratory, and   dedicated to use in support of
              ocean science research.        The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment
              Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and
              safe conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support   for
              such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and
              retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars,
              gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research
              sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite
              transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment
              such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data
              retrieval sites.       The Project Director, Quentin M. Lewis is fully
              qualified to direct this project having had considerable experience in
              overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.        This
              project will allow the institution to acquire a wire block, and a cable cleaner
              and upgrade two depth sounding transducers.  ***
