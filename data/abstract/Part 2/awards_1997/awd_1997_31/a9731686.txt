Abstract    :
                9731686  Trussell      An understanding of junctional mechanisms at synapses
              is a  central issue in basic neuroscience. It is also central to  understanding
              many pathological conditions of the nervous  system, since pharmacological
              treatments of nervous  illnesses usually target some aspect of synaptic 
              transmission.  The current intense interest in long-term  modification to
              synaptic strength as a model for memory also  depends on a thorough
              understanding of synaptic  transmission.  The award will support U.S.
              participation in  an intensive workshop on current progress and new directions 
              in synaptic transmission.  The principal organizers are  Professors Laurence
              Trussell of the Department of  Physiology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and
              Stephan  Redman of the Department of Neuroscience, Australian  National 
              University.  The workshop will be held Jan 2427th,  1998, in Thredbo, Australia
              and supported, in part, by the  Australian Department of Industry, Science, and
              Technology  (DIST).  It will involve eight senior researchers from  Germany,
              Israel, England, and the United States in addition  to seventeen senior
              researchers from Australia.  The U.S. team will consist of four senior
              researchers and  eight promising young U.S. graduate students and  postdoctoral
              fellows who will interact with Australian  students postdocs, and faculty. 
              Bringing these senior and  junior researchers to this workshop will help foster
              new  opportunities for U.S./Australian scientific cooperation.  Moreover, it
              will provide a means for the relatively  isolated Australian students and
              younger faculty to interact  with scientists in their field from around the
              world.
