Abstract    :
                Conti, Peter  AST-9731520    Dr. Conti will continue his research into massive
              stars and star formation by carrying out observational studies in the
              near-infrared.  He will expand on his earlier spectroscopic classification work
              for hot, massive stars in the K-band to develop a system of spectral
              classification at shorter wavelengths (H band), which will minimize the effect
              of thermal dust emission.  He will carry out a systematic study of star forming
              regions containing massive stars, using infrared photometry to identify the hot
              star candidates, followed by spectroscopy to classify them and to investigate
              the existence and nature of circumstellar disks. His work will improve our
              knowledge of the initial phases of massive star formation, and our
              understanding of the properties of newly formed hot, massive stars.
