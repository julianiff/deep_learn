Abstract    :
               Transnational migration and global restructuring have produced an anomalous
              situation in San Francisco, where a powerful local labor union that is
              increasingly female and immigrant has contracts covering three quarters of the
              better hotels, with wages significantly higher than comparable non-unionized
              cities. The increase in immigration of Asian and Latino workers to the U.S. has
              usually been accused of responsibility for the relative decline of labor
              unions. This project, involving a cultural anthropologist from the University
              of California at Davis and her graduate students, will study unionization and
              labor relations in the San Francisco hotel industry. The project will combine
              archival research on the historical development and structure of the local
              hotel industry, economic restructuring, and specifically the history of the
              local union organization.  In depth interviews with key actors in this
              situation will focus on key events of union mobilization, the roles of women
              and immigrants and the impacts of economic and demographic restructuring.  This
              case study will refine and build upon recent theories of political process of
              social movements, which have tended to slight developing local interests,
              activities and meanings in favor of national structures, constraints and
              opportunities.  This research will provide an important in-depth case study
              that will advance our understanding of the basic causes relating migration,
              gender, economic restructuring and unionization.
