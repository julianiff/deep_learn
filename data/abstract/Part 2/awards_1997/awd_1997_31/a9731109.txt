              Abstract                                                                     
              Funds will be used to add two new capabilities to theSpectrum  Cross-Dispersed
              (SpeX) instrument at the Infrared Telescope  Facility (IRTF).  SpeX is a 0.8
              micrometer to 5.5 micrometer  medium-resolution, cross-dispersed spectrograph. 
              A low-  resolution (R=150) spectroscopy mode, and a high-speed time-  resolved
              spectroscopy mode will be added.  These capabilities  will cover the 0.8
              micrometer to 2.5 micrometer wavelength range.
