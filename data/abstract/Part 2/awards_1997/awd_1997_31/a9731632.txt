Abstract    :
                  Bildsten, Lars  AST-9731632      Dr. Bildsten's research will lay the
              theoretical groundwork for studies of astero-seismology of rapidly rotating
              stars.  He will investigate the effect of rotation on pulsation mode stability,
              and develop methods required for the calculation of pulsation eigenfunctions
              and mode frequencies.  His work will have implications for the understanding of
              the internal structure and evolution of two classes of stars : upper main
              sequence stars, particularly the slowly pulsating B stars, with the potential
              of measuring the convective core mass as a function of evolutionary state in
              the star, and accreting and rapidly rotating white dwarfs, with the potential
              of determining the masses, rotation rates, and properties of the accreted
              envelopes of white dwarf stars in these systems.  ***
