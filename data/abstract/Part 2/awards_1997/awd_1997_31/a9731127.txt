Abstract    :
                  9731127  Edwards    This team of scientists from the Univbersity of Rhode
              Island  and  the  University  of  Minnesota  will  test  the  hypothesis  that 
              horizontal advection plays a significant role in the  transport of  the 
              radioisotopes  230Th and 231Pa in the water  column  of  the  North  Atlantic. 
              Studies will involve measurement of  230Th  and  231Pa  in North Atlantic Deep
              Water, the Labrador Sea, and  other  water   masses  of  the  North  Atlantic 
              as  well  as  downcore  measurements  of the excess 231Pa/ 230Th isotopic ratio
               in  high  sedimentation  rate  cores  from the  Labrador  Sea.  Laboratory 
              studies would be conducted to determine distribution  coefficients  of  these 
              isotopes  between seawater and  particulate  surfaces.  Such   studies   should
               prove  important  in  interpreting  the  sedimentary record left by these
              isotopes inasmuch as that  record  provides  insight into the paleoceanogrphy
              of the North  Atlantic,  especially the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water.
