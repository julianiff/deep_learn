Abstract    :
              9731732  Ustach    This award to Duke University will provide instrumentation 
              for oceanographic research for use on R/V Cape Hatteras, a  research vessel
              operated by the Duke-University of North  Carolina Consortium as part of the
              University-National  Oceanographic laboratory System research fleet.  Specific 
              instruments to be acquired include fluorometer, altimeter  and transmissometer
              sensors for use with the CTD system for  measuring sea water properties, Niskin
              bottles for sampling  water, tube holders for use with the multi-corer bottom 
              sampler, a  debubbler for use in the underway water analysis  system, and a
              gravity corer for bottom sampling.  The shared-  use instrumentation supported
              here will assist marine  scientists conduct studies from R/V Cape Hatteras in
              the  western Atlantic Ocean, principally along the central  Atlantic cost of
              the United States, in the 1998 and in  future years.
