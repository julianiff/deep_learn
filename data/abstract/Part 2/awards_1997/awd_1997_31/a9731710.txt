Abstract    :
              OCE-9731710  Fernandez    The project will analyze high-frequency (HF) radar
              data and  associated ocean surface phenomena.  The objectives are to:  1)
              document the seasonal evolution of sub-tidal current; 2)  relate observed wind
              to currents; 3) measure the vertical  current shear and relate to wind; and 4)
              improve and  characterize HF radar ocean current algorithms.
