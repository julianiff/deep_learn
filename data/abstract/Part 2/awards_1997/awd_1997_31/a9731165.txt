Abstract    :
              AST-9731165                                                                     
                                          ABSTRACT                                    A new
              approach to speckle imaging using a large format CCD will  be developed.  In
              this technique many speckle patterns will be  accumulated along a subarray
              strip of the chip.  When the strip  is full, all the patterns are read out
              together.  This method can  reduce the read time overhead and allow for
              efficient speckle  imaging.  In this way, large format slow-readout CCDs, which
              are  already widely used in astronomy, can be used for high-resolution  imaging
              with little change in hardware.
