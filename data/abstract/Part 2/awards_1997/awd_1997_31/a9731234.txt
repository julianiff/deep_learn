Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    Squires  97-31234      During the three years of this project
              teachers and students from six Washington State high schools will work on
              research projects at Pacific National Laboratory (PNL). Each year one teacher
              and three students from each school  will work together with a scientist at PNL
              for 8 weeks. This working partnership will continue during the academic year in
              a research course which each district has committed to and with ongoing support
              of the scientist mentor. In the senior level research course the
              teacher-student teams will mentor other students. Teachers will participate for
              two years each. Students in the eleventh grade will participate in the 8-week
              summer research experience once. During the second year of the project another
              teacher from the same school but from a different discipline will begin  their
              participation along with their team of three students. The six school represent
              a blend of 4-school districts near PNL, one district 70 miles away, and the
              sixth district is 240 miles away. Over the life of the project 12 teachers and
              72 students will participate
