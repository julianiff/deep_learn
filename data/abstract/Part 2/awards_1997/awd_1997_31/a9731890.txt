Abstract    :
              This research is a continuation of a program in studies of electron scattering
              on simple atoms.  Electron-photon coincidence measurements will be carried out
              to determine the electron impact differential cross sections for excitation of
              the n=2 and n=3 states in atomic hydrogen at several electron energies.    This
              research at an RUI institution will involve a strong component of undergraduate
              participation.
