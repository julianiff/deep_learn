Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the study of nonlinear optics with low power, cw lasers
              in situations where previously only high power, pulsed lasers could be used. 
              Ultra-low-loss, high reflectivity mirrors will be used to construct a cw Raman
              laser at the mW level, and the quantum intensity noise of this new laser will
              be studied.  The studies will probe the effects of (a) the quantum statistics
              of the cw Raman output, (b) the influence of the competition of the Stokes
              longitudinal modes, and (c) the population dynamics of the Raman medium and
              possible routes to chaos.
