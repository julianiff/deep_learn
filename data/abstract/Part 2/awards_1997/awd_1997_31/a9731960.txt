Abstract    :
              9731960  Schadler    The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) will establish a
               Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in materials  science and
              engineering.  Undergraduate students will be  recruited from universities and
              colleges with strong engineering  and science programs, including women's
              colleges and Historically  Black Colleges and Universities. Students will
              participate in a  wide range of materials research, from the stability of
              thermal  barrier coatings to the synthesis of nanostructured materials;  the
              underlying common theme is structure-property relationships.  %%%  A goal of
              this REU program is to expose the students to  application of their fundamental
              work to solve an engineering  problem.  For this, the students will spend a
              portion of their  time at a local industrial site. The multidisciplinary nature
              of  the research projects and close liaison with industry associates  will
              provide a valuable experience to the undergraduate students  participating in
              the program  ***
