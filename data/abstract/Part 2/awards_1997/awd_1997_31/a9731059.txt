Abstract    :
              9731059  Chalmers  The objective of this project is to develop an analytical
              device in which the degree to which a cell is immunologically labeled is
              quantified on a cell-by-cell basis.  The fundamental basis of this device is
              the ability to quantify the position and velocity of a large number of
              immunomagnetically labeled cells in a well characterized magnetic field
              gradient.  This project is to have both fundamental and applied applications
              for the quantification of the degree to which a cell is immunologically
              labeled.  This is to assist in the optimization of immunomagnetic labels and
              separation devices.  ***
