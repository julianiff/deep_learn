Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    This project will develop the readout electronics for a mosaic of 96
              CCDs.  The design for the mosaic and readout system will be based on a
              successful 16 CCD mosaic developed for the QUasar Equatorial Survey Team
              (QUEST).  The larger camera, also to be used in the QUEST project, will improve
              on the prototype in a number of significant ways, including improved angular
              resolution, UV sensitivity, and the ability to extend the survey from +/- 6
              degrees declination centered on the celestial equator to +/- 24 degrees.
