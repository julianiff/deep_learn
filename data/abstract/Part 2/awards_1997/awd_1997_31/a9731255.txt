Abstract    :
              The focus of the research is to develop an embedded crack analytical method for
              assessing the serviceability and safety of concrete and masonry structures. 
              The behavior of reinforced concrete/masonry structures is complicated due to
              the interaction of ductile and brittle materials.  With the addition of steel
              reinforcement, different limit states and failure modes, ranging from ductile
              to brittle, can evolve in concrete/masonry structures, depending on the loading
              conditions as well as the quantity of reinforcement.  The ability to capture
              these mechanisms is of primary importance for the evaluation of existing civil
              infrastructure systems as well as for the design of new structures.  Existing
              analytical methods using the discrete or smeared crack modeling approach suffer
              from a number of shortcomings.  The smeared crack approach cannot capture the
              brittle shear behavior of reinforced concrete deep beams and shear walls, while
              the discrete crack approach is not suitable for modeling diffuse cracks. 
              Hence, a third approach based on an efficient in that it does not require
              remeshing, which is often needed in the discrete crack analysis, and it is able
              to eradicate the major deficiencies of the smeared crack approach by
              introducing a displacement discontinuity within the element domain.  The
              concept is new and has a sound theoretical basis founded on variational
              principles.
