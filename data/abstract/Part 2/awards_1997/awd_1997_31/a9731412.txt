Abstract    :
              9731412  Cook    The WV-Handle On Science Project is a local systemic change
              project (LSC) that involves a collaboration of local school systems, informal
              science centers, colleges, and business and industry (e.g., Bayer Corp.).  This
              project is offering a comprehensive five-year science education reform
              initiative for 49 schools in the five West Virginia Northern Panhandle counties
              (i.e., Brooke, Hancock, Marshall, Ohio, and Wetzel).  All of the approximately
              625 K-6 teachers will receive professional development focusing on
              inquiry-based teaching strategies, science content, and alternative assessment
              relating to exemplary instructional materials.  These materials will consist of
              a combination of units from Science and Technology for Children (STC), Full
              Option Science System (FOSS), and Insights.  The modules that the teachers will
              be using as their instructional science program will be refurbished at the
              Materials Resource Center of West Liberty State College's SMART-Center.  It is
              expected that the WV-Handle on Science Project will serve as a model program
              for k-6 science education reform for the entire state of West Virginia.
