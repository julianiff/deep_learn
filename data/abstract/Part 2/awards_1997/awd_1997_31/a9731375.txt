Abstract    :
              9731375  Schoen    The PRIME-TEAM project is a two-year high school mathematics
              professional development and curricular implementation project for 65 lead
              teachers in nineteen Iowa schools/districts.  As a Teacher Leadership project,
              it builds the teacher infrastructure needed for a future, planned scale-up and
              school-wide implementation of the Core-Plus instructional materials in
              participating schools/districts.  Each participant is involved in 168 hours of
              comprehensive professional development through summer workshops, academic year
              activities, and reflective teaching of the Core Plus materials.       Project
              evaluation utilizes protocols and instruments from the Local Systemic Change
              Core Evaluation, together with student achievement data from standardized,
              national instruments administered in each school/district.       Cost sharing,
              derived primarily from participating districts/schools, is approximately 90% of
              the NSF request.
