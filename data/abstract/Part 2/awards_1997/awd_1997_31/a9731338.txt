Abstract    :
              97-31338  Linda Shore    This project will conduct a "proof of concept" around
              establishing a two-year program for novice teachers recruited from the San
              Francisco and San Mateo school districts.  Attrition rates for new teachers are
              extremely high, and this project will identify and implement strategies for
              keeping them in their classrooms. The program will include:  instruction in
              standards-based content and inquiry-based teaching; links with experienced
              mentors; both electronic and in-person approaches to link novice teachers with
              each other; and strategies for connecting novice teachers to he Exploratorium. 
              The program will be evaluated both internally and externally.
