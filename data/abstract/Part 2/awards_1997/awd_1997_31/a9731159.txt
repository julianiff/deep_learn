Abstract    :
              The aim of this Research Planning Grant is to develop a data base on employment
              by gender and industry in Puerto Rico. The project is part of a larger study on
              the structural and individual factors that explain gender inequalities in the
              labor market. It uses Puerto Rico as a case study, since the island represents
              the oldest experience in export-led industrialization in the developing world.
              The literature on women's work and development provides insights into the
              tendency towards feminization of the labor force, and it points out the
              persistence of occupational segregation and earning differences by gender.
              However, few studies have addressed the causes of the persistence of gender
              inequalities in the social division of labor during the course of export-led
              socioeconomic development. In part, this has been due to methodological
              limitations and the lack of a consistent data bases for research. Employing two
              1990 cross-sectional data sets, this project will attempt to remedy the
              problem. The data sets include the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) of the
              U.S. Bureau of Census, and the U.S. Economic Censuses for manufacture,
              wholesale trade, retail trade and services. These data will be classified by
              gender, industry, education, life cycle, household characteristics and
              migration experience, and combined with comparable data already compiled for
              1970 and 1980. At least three purposes will be served: (1) the empirical
              analysis of changes in employment by gender across industries during the last
              three decades; (2) the development of electronic data bases for use by other
              researchers; (3) the availability of detailed data that will enable comparisons
              between labor market structures and the experiences of Puerto Rican workers in
              Puerto Rico and the United States, as well as with the experiences of Latinos
              and other minority groups in the United States.
