              Abstract  ATM-9731089  Gutzler, David S.   University of New Mexico  Title:
              Observations and Modeling of Large-Scale Controls on Summer  Rainfall in
              Southwest North America    The broad goals of the proposal are to characterize
              interannual  summer precipitation anomalies in the southwestern United States
              in  order to guide future prediction effort.  Observational data along  with
              the CCM3 model output will be analyzed.  A control run of CCM3  with the SST
              fixed will be examined for realistic monsoon  simulation across the southwest
              USA.  If the simulation is not  realistic, sensitivity experiments for
              artificial topographic  relief will be conducted.  Water being very important
              over this  region, any new insights into the mechanisms that modulate summer 
              rainfall in the southwest USA will have important social benefits.
