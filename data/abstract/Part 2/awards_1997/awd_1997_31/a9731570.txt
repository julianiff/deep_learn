Abstract    :
                  A special meeting of the Austronesian Formal Linguistics  Association (AFLA)
              is planned for 27-29 March 1998. The theme for  AFLA V will be "Perspectives on
              Noun Incorporation in Austronesian  Languages." In order to explore the
              theoretical implications of  noun incorporation (NI) fully, AFLA V will invite
              linguists who are  native speakers of Austronesian languages to participate.
              The  invitees are two participants from University of Antananarivo 
              (Madagascar), one Malagasy-speaking linguist from Massey University  (New
              Zealand), and one linguist from the University of the South  Pacific (Vanuatu).
                    NI has been selected as the theme for the meeting because it  is a highly
              productive strategy in the family of Austronesian  languages, and also because
              of the significance of NI for  fundamental issues of syntactic and
              morphological theory. Keynote  speakers will present several perspectives on
              where NI takes  place in the grammar (from transformational approaches locating
               NI in the syntax, through to lexicalist approaches locating NI in  processes
              of word formation), and hence the nature of the  linguistic theory required to
              account for its semantic and  morphological properties.
