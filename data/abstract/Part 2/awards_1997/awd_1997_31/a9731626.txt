Abstract    :
              A series of experiments will be conducted to explore the psychological processes
              underlying the effects of death-related thought demonstrated in previous terror
              management research. The proposed research will: (a) explore the role of
              implicit affect (i.e., the activation of cognitive structures associated with
              affect without the direct subjective experience of emotion) in mediating the
              effects of death-related thought on social behavior, (b) explore the effect of
              death-related thought on the creative integration of new information and
              experience with existing psychological structures, with emphasis on the role of
              these processes in the stability and change of social stereotypes and
              self-concepts, and (c) investigate alternative ways in which members of
              minority groups and people alienated from the mainstream culture defend against
              death-related thoughts. The proposed research has important implications for
              understanding unconscious psychological defense, stereotyping, change and
              growth in the individual self-concept, minority alienation with the mainstream
              culture, and affiliation with deviant subgroups, such as gangs.
