This activity will support a "Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU)" Program to involve undergraduates in experiments at CERN
              (in Switzerland) during the summer months.  There are many research groups
              eager to have a student working with them for the summer, however, we expect
              that most students will join an experimental team associated with the very
              strong U.S. involvement in the LHC program, and in the ATLAS and CMS
              experiments in particular.  After an orientation week in the 
U.S., students
              will be sent to CERN where they will join the highly successful CERN Summer
              Student Program which has been available to European students each summer for
              many years.  This program involves not only membership of an active research
              team, but also a series of lectures on a variety of science topics - in
              particular both theoretical and experimental particle physics and particle
              detection techniques.  The special environment offered by CERN will allow the
              students to experience an international social and cultural dimension to their
              education in addition to the more formal physics research experience.
