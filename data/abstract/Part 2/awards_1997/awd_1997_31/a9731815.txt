Abstract    :
              9731815  Paesler    North Carolina State University will continue a Research 
              Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in its Physics  department. Fifteen
              undergraduate students will be recruited with  a recruitment focus on minority
              and women candidates.  Students  will participate in materials physics research
              that includes  semiconductor thin films and interfaces, epitaxial growth of 
              semiconductor structures, amorphous semiconductors and  insulators, and
              fullerenes.  %%%  Undergraduate students will have the opportunity to
              participate  in state-of-the-art materials physics research and will be 
              utilizing a variety of modern instruments.  ***
