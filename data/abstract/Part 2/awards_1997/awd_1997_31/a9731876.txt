Abstract    :
              This summer research program for undergraduates in Cell and Molecular Biology
              supports undergraduate research in laboratories of leading researchers in the
              biological sciences at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.  Members of
              minority groups underrepresented in biological research and students from
              institutions without broad research facilities are selected for the program
              based on research interests and potential commitment to a research career. 
              During a 9-week program, each student works on an independent research project
              in a faculty mentor's laboratory.  Depending upon the project, participants
              learn current techniques including DNA cloning, PCR sequencing, in situ
              hybridization, cell culture and Western blotting.  They also participate in
              workshops on specific research areas, bioethics, advice from graduate students
              and preparation for the Graduate Record Examination.  Students write and orally
              present a research proposal during the beginning of the program, and, at the
              conclusion, submit a paper summarizing their work.  The paper is presented at a
              symposium for the participants.
