Abstract    :
              This program continues studies of solar energetics and dynamics, based on the
              Mount Wilson solar tower observing facility and its digital database (dating
              back to 1967).  The investigator's intent is increasing understanding of the
              solar cycle of variability and its influence on Earth's environment.  In
              addition, he makes his data available to the community via the website. 
              Specifically, this continuing program:  (1) makes magnetogram observations
              consisting of magnetograms, dopplergrams and intensitygrams for at least 6
              pairs of line wing samples in four different spectral lines, (2) applies an
              improved solar radius definition to the 1986-present data set, and (3) studies
              the vertical propagation of acoustic and magnetic oscillations using the sodium
              D line.
