Abstract    :
              AST-9731052                                                                     
                                          ABSTRACT                                      Funds
              will be used to develop the Advanced Spectral Imager (ASI)  which will use
              Fabry-Perot interferometry to provide high  spectral resolution images with
              sub-arcsecond image quality over  a wide field of view.  The ASI will provide
              two-dimensional maps  of velocity, spectral line strength, and spectral line
              width for  astronomical objects.  The ASI design is based on successful 
              experience with the Rutgers Imaging Fabry-Perot system currently  in operation
              at CTIO.
