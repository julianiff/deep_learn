Abstract    :
                  Pinsonneault, Marc  AST-9731621      Drs. Pinsonneault and Terndrup will
              study stellar rotation and mixing in low mass stars, by developing theoretical
              models that incorporate new input physics and model angular momentum transport
              and mixing, which are constrained by observed data on stellar abundances and
              rotation.  They will begin with models appropriate to main-sequence stars, with
              application of mixing scenarios to the problem of light element (especially
              Lithium) abundances as a function of age, rotation, and composition.  A key
              goal is to construct a physically self-consistent model which simultaneously
              explains both mixing and the evolution of angular momentum.  Successful
              main-sequence models will then become the starting point for models of evolved
              red giant stars, which will test the theory with observations of abundance
              anomalies and horizontal branch rotation.    ***
