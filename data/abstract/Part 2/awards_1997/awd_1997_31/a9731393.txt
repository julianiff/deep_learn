Abstract    :
                  9731393  Chang     The weather and climate in the mid-latitudes are affected
              by the passage of cyclones and anticyclones.  These systems are generally
              associated with waves in the upper troposphere which are organized into well
              defined regions known as storm tracks.  Better understanding how the storm
              tracks form, how they evolve and what determines their location and intensity
              may help to advance the accuracy of medium range weather forecasting.     Dr.
              Chang's recent results from data analyses and modeling studies suggest that
              mid-latitude baroclinic waves in these storm tracks are organized into wave
              packets which propagate eastward with group velocities much faster than the
              phase speeds of individual waves.  The energy associated with these wave
              packets may contribute to the formation and development of upper level troughs
              and surface cyclones.  Under this award, the principal investigator will extend
              his earlier results on the properties of wave packets and examine what role
              they might play in atmospheric predictability.
