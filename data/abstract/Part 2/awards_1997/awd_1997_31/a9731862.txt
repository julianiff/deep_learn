Abstract    :
              9731862  STUBBS    Professor Christopher Stubbs and others at the University of 
              Washington, in collaboration with researchers at Mt. Stromlo  Observatory,
              Australia, are engaged in a search for  supernovae (SNe) in dense clusters of
              galaxies.  This will  contribute to our understanding of the geometry of the 
              universe, to our understanding of distortions in the  expanding universe, and
              to our knowledge of the final stages  of stellar evolution. The U.S. group has
              5% of the time on  the MaCHO 1.3m telescope and wide-field imaging camera, an 
              instrument that is essential to the success of the project,  located at Mt.
              Stromlo, Australia.  This award will support  the travel to Mt. Stromlo and per
              diem of  Professor Christopher Stubbs' graduate student, David Reiss,  for
              three trips a year for two years during which he will be  working on his Ph.D
              thesis.  The Australian counterpart is  Dr. Brian P. Schmidt of the Institute
              for Advanced Studies,  Mt. Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatories, Australia.
