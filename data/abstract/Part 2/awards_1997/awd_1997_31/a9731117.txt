Abstract    :
              9731117  Krug  The goal of this meeting is to bring together molecular
              biologists and structural biologists investigating prokaryotic and eukaryotic
              RNA-binding proteins in a forum designed for efficient information exchange and
              in an environment that can stimulate future research and collaboration. 
              Approximately 1/3 of the participants will be graduate students and
              postdoctorals.  Speakers will include a mix of experts and young investigators
              in the areas of molecular biology and structural biology of RNA-binding
              proteins.  This unique meeting will bring together an interdisciplinary group
              of experts and young investigators in a format conducive to scientific
              discussions, thereby spawning new interactions and collaborations between
              molecular biologists and structural biologists.
