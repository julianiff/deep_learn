Abstract    :
              9731322  Wurzbach      The Council of Chief State School Officers has been
              engaged in working with states to identify new approaches to initial teacher
              certification through the Interstate New Teacher Assessment and Support
              Consortium (INTASC).  This project will support specific pieces of that effort
              that target mathematics and science.  The first component trains practicing
              mathematics teachers in a selected number of states to provide support to
              beginning teachers who are developing mathematics portfolios and to master
              procedures for scoring the portfolios.  The second component focuses on
              refining science portfolio guidelines based on field test results.
