Abstract    :
                 97-31324   Acevado    This is a project to involve teams of Puerto Rico
              teachers and students in research using forest reserves in Puerto Rico. During
              each year of this 3-year project there will be a project set up phase, a summer
              residential component, and an academic year (AY) follow-up. The summer
              residential component is five weeks long. The project has an emphasis on
              ecological and environmental research. Each year eight teams of one teacher and
              two students  will conduct research in a selected natural reserve of Puerto
              Rico. At the end of the summer teams will make a joint presentation of their
              findings at a selected site. Interspersed with the research activities are
              workshops that are intended to prepare teachers and students for research
              activities; measurement and data analysis skills will be mastered along with
              just-in-time content. The research activities will be under the supervision of
              a group of scientists. It is expected that teachers will integrate these
              experiences into school curricula in the form of forest-related research
              projects.
