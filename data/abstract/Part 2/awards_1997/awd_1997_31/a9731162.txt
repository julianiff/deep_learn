Abstract    :
              This dissertation research uses theory, methods and findings from sociology of
              professions and science studies to examine academic economics in the U.S.
              during the 1970s and 1980s. At this time economics was focusing more and more
              on complex mathematical techniques and on models of free markets. This was
              despite protests - often coming from high-ranking mathematical economists
              themselves - that academic work was becoming increasingly unrealistic. The
              research claims that this state of affairs can be understood by considering the
              changing relationship between academic economists and economists pursuing
              careers in more applied fields.  Academics pursued more and more abstract
              theories because they saw themselves as a scientific elite providing the
              correct knowledge behind all effective work going on in the other fields.
              Ironically however, they were able to do this only because the more applied
              fields in fact were becoming increasingly separated from academia and were
              relying more and more on their own ideas and ways of doing things.  Evidence
              supporting this interpretation will be looked for in the changing patterns of
              employment of economists across the different fields, and in the statements of
              economists themselves - both academic and applied - concerning what they do and
              what they see as being the role of academic theories.  Data for the
              investigations is of four types:  existing statistics on patterns of
              employment; accounts of careers including biographies and listings in handbooks
              of the American Economic Association; written evidence of the attitudes of
              academic economists; and original interviews of economists in Chicago and
              Washington, DC, concentrating on those in non-academic career fields.
