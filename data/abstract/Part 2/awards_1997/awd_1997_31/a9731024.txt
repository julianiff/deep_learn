Abstract    :
                Project Abstract  This proposal is for a conference on auctions and
              infrastructure hosted by the University of Maryland in the spring of 1998. The
              conference lasts two and one half days (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). About
              one dozen papers are scheduled for presentation and discussion. In addition,
              participants discuss informally ideas during breaks and meals.  An important
              economic development of the 1990s has been the restructuring of infrastructure
              industries. Throughout the world, markets are replacing monopoly, and private
              firms are increasingly providing goods and services that once were provided by
              government. Auctions are playing a major role in this restructuring. Auctions
              provide an efficient and transparent way for governments to privatize
              industries, for monopolies to divest their assets, and for scarce resources to
              be allocated. Applications are seen in every infrastructure industry:
              telecommunications (e.g., the FCC spectrum auctions), electric power, natural
              gas, water, air, and transportation. Treasury auctions are a related
              application.  In the early 1990s, economists realized that existing auction
              theory was inadequate for these applications. Although auction theory for the
              sale of a single item is well developed, each of these applications involves
              the sale of multiple items, often with value interdependencies among items. In
              response, there has been a burst of research activity on auctions for multiple
              items. This work is theoretical, experimental, and empirical.  The proposed
              conference will bring together about forty experts in the auction field to
              present and discuss their research on auctions. The conference will mix
              theorists, experimentalists, and empiricists. The common core will be auctions
              and a desire to apply auction ideas to these important real world applications.
              Industry experts and policy makers will also participate. The conference
              proceedings will be widely disseminated.
