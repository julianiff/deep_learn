Abstract    :
              9731367  Oberem    This project, sponsored by the California State University at
              San Marcos, will carry out a three-year project to teach teachers of high
              school physics an inquiry approach to learning of basic physics concepts. The
              basis of the project will be to use the University of Washington's Physic by
              Inquiry approach supplemented by Real-time Physics and the CPU (Constructing
              Physics Understanding) program. Each summer 36 teachers will be enrolled in a
              three-week program. During the academic year project staff will aid in the
              implementation of the program by electronic communication and by biweekly
              seminars. Specially selected, experienced master teachers will mentor the
              participants and aid in the delivery of the program. In addition pre-service
              teachers will be selected to help with the project so that they will enter the
              teaching profession with background in teaching using the inquiry approach. A
              full evaluation program will assess teacher knowledge, the change in how the
              teacher teaches physics and student achievement.
