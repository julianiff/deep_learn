Abstract    :
                Baron, Edward  AST-9731450      In a collaborative effort, Dr. Baron of the
              Univesity of Oklahoma and Dr. Hauschildt of the University of Georgia will
              continue their work of modeling the transport of radiation through a variety of
              astrophysical plasmas, with particular attention to supernovae.  Their work
              focuses on applying the results of their modeling to supernovae and comparing
              theoretical predictions with observed data, as well as making continued
              improvements to their radiative transport code.  Among the goals of their
              analysis are improving understanding of the connection between specific classes
              of supernovae and stellar evolution models of the progenitor star, and studying
              the effects of stellar parameters, such as the metallicity of the progenitor,
              on the observed spectrum and light curve and the use of all types of supernovae
              as distance indicators.
