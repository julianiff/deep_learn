Abstract    :
              9731945  PFEIFFER    This project will supply shipboard scientific support
              equipment for the research vessel CAPE HENLOPEN operated by the University of
              Delaware, College of Marine Studies and dedicated to use in support of ocean
              science research.          The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program
              provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe
              conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such items
              as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of
              scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and
              earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites,
              communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers
              for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment such as
              motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval
              sites.    The Project Director, Timothy F. Pfeiffer is fully qualified to
              direct this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the
              acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.          This project will
              allow the institution to acquire a small winch and a display for the bridge
              console.  ***
