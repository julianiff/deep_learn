Abstract    :
              9731391  Weingartner    This award to University of Alaska Fairbanks will
              provide  instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/V  Alpha
              Helix, a research vessel operated by the university's  marine center in Seward
              as part of the University-National  Oceanographic Laboratory System research
              fleet. Specific  instruments to be acquired include an acoustic doppler 
              current profiler (hull mounted) for measuring ocean  currents, replacement
              components for the auto-analyzer  system for ocean nutrient analyses, a
              shipboard computer for  data management, plus water sampling bottles and light 
              sensor instrumentation for bother subsurface and shipboard  measurements.  The
              shared-use instrumentation supported here  will assist marine scientists
              conduct studies, particularly  in the Northeast Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea,
              in 1998 and  future years.
