Abstract    :
              AST-9731034                                                               
              ABSTRACT                                    Funding will be used for partial
              support for a professional  meeting sponsored by the Astronomical Society of
              the Pacific  (ASP) to be held in Albuquerque, NM, on Sunday, June 28 to 
              Wednesday, July 1, 1998.  Local host organizations for this  meeting will be
              the University of New Mexico and the Air Force  Research Laboratory.  The
              meeting will explore the synthesis of  adaptive optics and optical
              interferometers for the next  generation of high resolution optical telescopes.
               The  proceedings will be published by the ASP.
