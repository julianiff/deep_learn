Abstract    :
              9731782  Navrotsky    The goal of this project entitled Energetics of
              Microporous  Materials is a fundamental understanding of the structure- 
              stability-property relations necessary for innovative synthesis,  tailoring of
              properties, and predicting long-term thermal  stability and materials
              compatibility in complex and useful  systems. Despite their importance, the
              thermodynamic properties  of classes of materials such as zeolites are poorly
              known, and  this project will determine the energetics of zeolites and  related
              materials using high-temperature reaction calorimetry.  %%%  Zeolites and
              related microporous materials form a large class of  technologically important
              materials with applications in  catalysis, gas separations, ion exchange and
              sorption that  impact many fields important to society including the 
              environment, energy, and national defense.  ***
