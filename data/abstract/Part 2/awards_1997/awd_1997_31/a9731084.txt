This project will support the participation of researchers
              from 
the United States at the Fifth International Workshop on 
Mathematical
              Aspects of Fluid and Plasma Dynamics to be 
held in Wailea, Hawaii from June
              28 - July 3, 1998.  The 
objective of the workshop is to give researchers in
              the 
mathematics of fluids, plasmas, stellar systems, and rarefied 
gas
              dynamics the opportunity to present recent progress and 
learn about new
              directions and tools.  The conference will 
focus on the following main areas
              of research: 
magnetohydrodynamics, kinetic theory of gases and granular
              
flow, compressible and incompressible fluid mechanics, semi-
conductor
              dynamics, and numerical methods for resolution of 
these problems. The
              workshop will bring together researchers 
from the U.S., Japan, Canada,
              Australia, India, and Europe.
