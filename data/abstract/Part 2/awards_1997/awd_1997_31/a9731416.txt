Abstract    :
                  Robinson, Edward  AST-9731416      Dr. Robinson will carry out an
              observational program to study black holes which occur in soft X-ray transient
              systems (SXT's), binary systems in which mass is being transferred from a
              relatively normal star to a compact star through an accretion disk.  He will
              use the Hobby-Eberly Telescope for a long-term synoptic program of spectroscopy
              of these faint SXT's, as well as detailed studies of selected objects.  The
              primary goals of the program are to determine more accurate mass ratios and
              black hole masses and to determine the properties and evolution of accretion
              disks surrounding the black holes.
