Abstract    :
              AST-9731200                                                               
              Abstract                                    Funds from this grant will be used
              to develop the technology for  arrays of voltage-biased superconducting
              transition-edge  bolometers as direct detectors for ground-based astrophysics
              at  far infrared and millimeter wavelengths.  In this new type of  bolometer,
              strong negative electrothermal feedback maintains the  sensor temperature
              nearly constant.  This leads to several  advantages over conventional
              bolometers which use doped  semiconducting thermistors.
