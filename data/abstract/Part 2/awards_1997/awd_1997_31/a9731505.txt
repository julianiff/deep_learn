Abstract    :
              The goal of this work is to understand, explain and justify the methods by which
              we learn from experiments in the face of uncertainty and error.  Standard
              statistical methods (that involve significance tests, confidence intervals, and
              the like) are in widespread use in science.  But despite their widespread and
              successful use in science and other spheres, such methods have been subject to
              enormous philosophical controversy and criticism, giving rise to the popular
              subjective Bayesian way in philosophy of science.  This stark contrast between
              effective research practice and philosophical analysis demands close scrutiny. 
              The PI will do this by applying a framework for analysis which she has
              developed in the course of several publications.  Briefly stated, this
              framework views experiments as efforts to learn from error, with statistics
              contributing a disciplined way to model patterns of irregularity that allow
              errors to be distinguished from background noise.  By weaving together
              strategies and techniques for learning from error that are employed in fields
              as diverse as statistics, engineering, physics, biology, and psychology, the PI
              is uncovering strikingly similar patterns of learning from error-patterns
              overlooked in the leading philosophical accounts of scientific inference.
