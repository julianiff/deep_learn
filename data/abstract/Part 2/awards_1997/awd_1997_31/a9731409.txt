Abstract    :
                  9731409  Peach    This project proposes to have both middle and high
              schoolteachers participate in a summer oceanographic research experience.  It
              will take the teachers through the scientific process of from research project
              design to data collection, analyses, synthesis, and interpretation.    After
              this they will devise strategies to translate these research experiences into
              investigative learning activities for implementation into their science
              classes.  Included will be the development a manual of classroom and
              field-based exercises together with a set of inquiry-based learning modules
              that will be incorporated into the SEA educational web site.    Almost all of
              the work will be done at Woods Hole campus and on sailing vessels in the Gulf
              of Maine.  Thus work will be conducted at sea and on the campus of Woods Hole
              in Massachusetts.
