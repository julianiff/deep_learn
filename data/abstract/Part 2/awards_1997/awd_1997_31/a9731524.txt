Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT  EEC-9731524  SCHWARTZ    The food industry is a very important
              component of the U.S economy and its processing and packaging technology is
              developing rapidly.  This award is for a planning meeting to determine the
              feasibility and viability of Ohio State University becoming a research site of
              the multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
              Aseptic Processing and Packaging Studies.  North Carolina State University and
              the University of California-Davis are the Center's current research sites.   
              The Ohio State University research site proposes to expand the current Center's
              research agenda with the following projects:     1.  Validating Sterilization
              Efficiency of Aseptic Packaging Systems   2.  Modeling of Pulsed-Electric Field
              Processes   3.  PEF Bactericidal Effect Visualized by High Speed Microscopic
              Imaging  4.  Decontamination of Food-Contact Surfaces by Ozone and Potential
              Application in           Aseptic Fillers  5.  Microbial Control of Fluid Foods
              with Microfiltration and Combinations of         Microfiltration with other
              Non-Thermal Processing Methods  6.  An Improved Safe Cheddar Cheese from Raw
              Milk  7.  Process Development of Single Step Microbial and Colloidal
              Stabilization for        Fermented Beverages    The Principal Investigator and
              his colleagues are internationally recognized experts in their fields and are
              well qualified to run their planning meetings.
