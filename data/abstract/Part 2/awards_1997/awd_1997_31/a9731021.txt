Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Graduate Student Travel  Award.   It funds one
              graduate student to travel to two  laboratories of potential sponsoring
              scientists.  The  student will then apply for an NSF's Minority Postdoctoral 
              Research Fellowship in the area of microbial biology and  environmental
              microbiology.
