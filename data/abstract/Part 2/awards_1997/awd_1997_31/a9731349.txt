Abstract    :
              9731349  Vasudevan    This research applies high resolution transmission
              electron  microscopy in a study of the massive transformation in TiAl-  based
              intermetallic alloys.  Two important issues are  addressed related to the
              mechanisms of massive  transformations in TiAl alloys: (1) the nature of the 
              massive -parent interphase interfacial structure, and (2)  the role of defect
              structures.  The study focuses on alloys  with aluminum contents between 46-47
              at. %, which allows  retention of large areas of the massive-parent interfaces.
               Orientation relationships that develop during nucleation and  the early stages
              of growth of the massive phase are studied  in samples whose reaction kinetics
              has been determined.  The  structures of the parent -massive phases and the
              types of  interfaces that between them are determined in samples  undergoing
              different undercoolings, reaction start  temperatures, and growth rates.  The
              state of coherency of  the interfaces is determined and from these studies 
              atomistic models of the structures of the massive-parent  interphase interfaces
              are developed.  The atomic structures  of defects (dislocations and stacking
              faults) are determined  as well, and their role in the growth of the massive
              product  assessed.  %%%  New alloys based on the TiAl compound are of great 
              importance for application in high temperature propulsion  systems because of
              their unique combination of properties.  Mechanical properties of these
              materials are controlled by  their microstructures, which is the focus of this
              research.  ***
