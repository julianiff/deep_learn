Abstract    :
              9731541  George    During the 3 years of this project, 72 high school and middle
              school teachers and 36 students will work as members of atmospheric research
              teams studying each of ten airshed around the Portland, OR metropolitan area.
              Each summer's activities include a 4-week  atmospheric interaction research
              course and a one-week air quality measurement campaign during a pollution
              episode. Transfer to the classroom is anticipated through action research
              projects during the academic year. An interactive webpage will enable all
              partners to access data, real time models of the atmosphere, and descriptions
              of the action research projects. A lead high school will serve as the
              Horizons-Air site for an airshed zone and will work collaboratively with four
              other middle/high schools, the Horizons-Met sites.
