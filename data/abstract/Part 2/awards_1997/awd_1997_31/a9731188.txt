Abstract    :
              9731188  CARIGNAN  This proposal requests support for shipboard scientific
              support equipment for the research SAVANNAH to be operated by the  Skidaway
              Institute of Oceanography, and dedicated to use in  support of ocean science
              research.      The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides
              funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of
              ocean science research. This Program provides support for such  items as deck
              equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of
              scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and
              earth satellite receivers to pin  point the location of research sites,
              communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers
              for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment such as
              motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval
              sites.    The Project Director, Steven J. Carignan is fully qualified to direct
              this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition
              and installation of shipboard equipment.    This project will assist the
              institution in the outfitting of the R/V SAVANNAH which will replace the R/V
              BLUE in 1999.  The R/V SAVANNAH is being built with institution funds.  NSF
              funds will be used to acquire an A-Frame, a J-Frame, a CTD winch, a workboat
              and several safety related items.    ***
