Abstract    :
              9731176  Hart    This project will develop technology in three areas applicable
              to the search for extra-solar planets.  A coronographic imager for operation in
              the 1 to 5 micrometer spectral range will be developed to be used initially
              with the 3.5 meter telescope of the USAF Starfire Optical Range (SOR), and
              later with the upgraded 6.5 meter MMT of the University of Arizona.  A novel
              concept for a high-order adaptive mirror to be used with the MMT will be
              investigated. The project will also modify an echelle spectrograph to provide
              resolution of ~200,000 to be used with the SOR and the MMT to examine
              brown-dwarfs and massive extra-solar planets.
