Abstract    :
                This project will contribute to our knowledge of gibbons (the lesser apes) in
              several ways.  First, new DNA sequences will be generated for all of the gibbon
              species.  These new sequences will be used to construct an evolutionary tree
              for the gibbons, and this tree forms a base from which to study other
              evolutionary questions.  A tree of the four subgenera and nine species of
              gibbons will be constructed using three independent DNA sequence data sets: 
              one from the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit II gene, one from the
              glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase gene encoded on the X chromosome, and one
              from the zinc finger gene encoded on the Y chromosome.  Levels of DNA sequence
              divergence will also be used to assess taxonomic status of species and
              subspecies relative to other well-accepted primate pairs.  These data also will
              be used to estimate the date of the split of gibbons from the great apes, and
              the subsequent gibbon radiation.  Morphological, vocal, and behavioral
              characters will be mapped onto the tree to study aspects of character
              evolution.  Finally, species-specific diagnostic sites will be identified,
              which may assist in conservation efforts since several gibbon species are
              classified as endangered.
