Abstract    :
                Gwinn, Carl  AST-9731584    Dr. Gwinn will use radio-wave scattering as a tool
              to learn about the structure of radio emission from pulsars.  He will continue
              an analysis of observations of the Vela pulsar, and investigate other pulsars
              that are potential targets.  He will also extend theoretical work to understand
              the effects of source structure on scintillation and perform simple modeling of
              magnetospheric refraction to compare with observations.  He will also analyze
              existing and new polarimetric observations of the Vela pulsar to test whether
              magnetospheric refraction produces the observed structure.
