Abstract    :
              9731321  Koke    Southwest Texas State University provides a 60 month Teacher
              and Student Development Through Research Experience project.  The project
              consists of two components.  The first component provides research
              opportunities for up to 30 middle and high school teachers each year in the
              areas of biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and technology.  The
              teachers work with faculty scientists/mentors on current research projects
              during an 8-9 week summer experience and are supported to transfer elements of
              the research into classroom experiences for their students.  The second
              component engages 18 high school students and up to 8 teachers each summer in
              courses and study leading to mathematics research.  Teachers also study
              learning theory and research topics in order to develop modules incorporating
              mathematics research topics into their instruction.  During the academic year
              student/teacher teams develop research projects and present them at a spring
              conference.  Participants communicate electronically with each other and a
              university faculty mentor.  An important element of the project is the phased
              shift of resources from NSF to institutional support over the project life.
