Abstract    :
                          CTS-9731927         D.T. Shaw         SUNY Buffalo        SUMMARY   
                 This research explores the potential use of carbon nanotubes as a medium   
              form porous heat pipes.  Carbon nanotubes, 20-100 microns in length and 30-400 
                angstroms in diameter will be synthesized by thermally dissociating ethylene 
                 over an iron catalyst. The carbon nanotubes need to be unblocked for
              effective     and unobstructed fluid flow.       This one year project consists
              of two parts(a) the construction of porous    nano heat pipes charged with
              methanol, and (b) measurement of the heat transfer    characteristics of these
              heat pipes.  The exploratory study will provide     valuable information
              regarding the feasibility of using carbon nanotubes to form     porous heat
              pipes, which eventually can be used in the cooling of integrated     circuits.
