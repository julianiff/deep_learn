Abstract    :
                    9731472  Navon      The overall objective of this project is to test and
              apply new approaches and mathematical methods for four-dimensional variational
              data assimilation, taking advantage of the availability of the adjoints of the
              full physics versions of global forecast models to improve the computational
              efficiency and representation of physical processes in the dynamical
              assimilation process.  Dr. Navon will employ the Florida State University
              Global Spectral Model (FSU GSM), developed by Dr. Krishnamurti, as the primary
              model for the studies.     The three major thrusts of this research are:  (1)
              to develop more efficient methods for parameter estimations for key parameters
              identified by the modeling community as having a sizeable impact on model
              forecasting performance and physical initialization;  (2) to evaluate the
              effectiveness of two computationally efficient methods for approximating the
              full 4-D variational process - the incremental approach and the multiple
              truncation incremental approach;  and (3) to test the Discrete Truncated Newton
              method with memory, a new large-scale unconstrained minimization algorithm. 
              The last will be done in collaboration with Dr. Fisher of ECMWF and Dr. Berger
              of OPTEAM, Ltd.     Efficient and effective four-dimensional data assimilation
              is a critical component in the effort to improve numerical weather forecasting.
              This research has considerable potential for advancing that effort.
