Abstract    :
              This research utilizes Rydberg atoms to investigate the non-linear dynamics of
              impulsively driven systems, to study the control and manipulation of atomic
              wavefunctions, to probe ultra-low energy electron-molecule scattering, and to
              examine the behavior of atoms near a solid surface.   Advantage will be taken
              of the fact that the excited electron in the Rydberg atom is in an orbit very
              far removed from the nucleus; thus its behavior is strongly affected by weak
              external perturbations.
