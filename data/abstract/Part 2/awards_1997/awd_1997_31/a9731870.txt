Abstract    :
              9731870  Naigles      This proposal development visit will allow the principal 
              investigator, Professor Letitia Naigles of Yale University,  to travel to
              LaTrobe University in Victoria, Australia, for  two weeks to discuss a
              cooperative research project with  Edith Bavin of the LaTrobe University School
              of  Psychological Science.  The subject of the study is the  relationship
              between early syntactic and vocabulary  development.  Previous studies have
              approached the problem  from the point of language production, with mixed
              results.  The new method they will apply, comprehension method of  preferential
              looking, to assess young children's grammatical  knowledge.  The project will
              establish the new method in  Australia leading to more accurate assessments of
              linguistic  knowledge in children acquiring English around the world.  The
              Australian investigator, Edith Bavin, is internationally  known and respected
              for her linguistic research.  She has  recently turned her attention to the
              acquisition of  knowledge, particularly native languages of Australia.  Thus 
              this collaboration also holds the possibility of  increased  insight on the
              main problem based on knowledge of  acquisition of languages other than
              English. This is a new  partnership which promises to lead to increased
              cooperation  in linguistics between the United States and Australia.
