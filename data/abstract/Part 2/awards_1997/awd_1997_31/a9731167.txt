Abstract    :
              AST-9731167                                                                     
                                          ABSTRACT                                    Funds
              will be used for development of the Phase Diverse Speckle  (PDS) technique for
              the post-detection correction of aberration  of solar images due to atmospheric
              fluctuations.  The effort will  extend the utility of the PDS technique to
              narrow-band,  polarimetric, and spectroscopic data sets.  Novel reconstruction 
              algorithms that employ optimal and unified estimators will be  developed by
              analogy to current PDS algorithms.  In addition,  refinements to current
              algorithms with regard to regularization  (suppression of noise amplification),
              space-variant blur, and  time-series processing will be made.
