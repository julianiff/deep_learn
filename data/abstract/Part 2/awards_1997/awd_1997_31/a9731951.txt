Abstract    :
              This proposal describes the further development of a multi-fluid simulation
              model of the global magnetosphere.  It is proposed that the model will allow a
              clear identification of processes which permit entry of solar wind plasma into
              the magnetosphere, the leakage of magnetospheric plasma into the solar wind,
              and the outflow of energized ionospheric plasma into the distant magnetosphere.
               Preliminary results show clear differences in the spatial distributions
              between plasma components with entry via the low latitude boundary layer and
              high latitude reconnection for northward IMF and via the mantle and dayside
              reconnection for southward IMF.  Comparison with in-situ observations will be
              undertaken for particular case studies to perform model validation studies.
