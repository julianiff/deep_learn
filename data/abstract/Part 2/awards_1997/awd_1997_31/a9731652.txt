Abstract    :
                Saar, Steven  AST-9731652    Dr. Saar will investigate the effects of stellar
              magnetic and surface phenomena, such as magnetic activity, rotation, and
              starspots, on high-precision radial velocity measurements which are used for
              the detection of extra-solar planets.  His goals are two-fold.  By better
              understanding the cause of radial velocity variations due to intrinsic stellar
              properties, he plans to verify current extra-solar planet candidates and to
              provide guidance to current and future planet searches.  His work will also
              lead to improved understanding of the interaction of magnetic fields with
              convection in stellar photospheres, and how convective properties vary with
              stellar parameters.   Much of his work concentrates on performing an analysis
              of line bisectors from high resolution spectroscopic data of a sample of
              main-sequence dwarf stars which have long-term spectral observations and cover
              a range of basic stellar parameters in temperature, activity level, and
              rotation properties.     ***
