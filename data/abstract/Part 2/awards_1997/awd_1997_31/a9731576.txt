Abstract    :
                Close, Laird  University of Hawaii Manoa  AST  97-31576      Dr. Close and
              co-PI's will  study the circumstellar disks around young stars in isolated dark
              clouds and cluster environments.  They will use the new adaptive optics system
              developed at the University of Hawaii for their observations, achieving
              diffraction-limited images in the infrared.  Their observational program
              includes a variety of young stellar objects to sample a range of environments :
              T Tauri stars in the Taurus-Auriga dark cloud, massive young Herbig Ae/Be
              stars, and nearby OB associations.  Observations that detect disks (estimated
              to be roughly 50%) will permit determinations of the disk age, mass, and
              accretion rates.   They will also model the scattered light disk images to
              place constraints on the nature of the dust.  Their ultimate goal is to use a
              combination of direct imaging followed by modeling to elucidate the processes
              by which stars and their planetary systems condense out of the dusty cores of
              molecular clouds.
