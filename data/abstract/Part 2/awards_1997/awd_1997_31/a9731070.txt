Abstract    :
              9731070  Donahue  This award will support the partnership efforts of the
              National Alliance of State Science and Mathematics Coalitions and the
              Educational Commission of the States (ECS) as a one-year "proof of concept"
              project to build state-level reform infrastructures in three states.    The
              proposal identifies a model for infrastructure that entails eight critical
              components.  These components involve a coalition of leadership across
              educational, business, and policy boundaries: a seasoned process for reviewing
              and assuring alignment of state policies with standards-based reform; a process
              for responding to gaps in systemic reform strategies; a process for assisting
              districts in the state as they select and implement standards-based curriculum,
              mechanisms for focusing resources in the state on systemic reform; mechanisms
              for collecting, analyzing, and communicating data on various  performance
              indicators; and mechanisms for using such data in formative fashion to adjust
              systemic reform strategies.    The NASSMC/ECS partnership presents a powerful
              opportunity of joining the efforts of mathematics and science educators
              (represented by NASSMC) to the policy levers in respective state education
              systems (represented by ECS) to create important, reform capable networks.
