Abstract    :
              This continuation of the Solar-Stellar Spectrograph Program incorporates a new
              paradigm to the investigators' research:  observing the stars as a sun, rather
              than the sun as a star.  While chromospheric diagnostics continue to play an
              integral part in analysis, the investigators have realized spectral lines
              originating from the 'quiet' Sun and stars have potential to significantly
              alter the way long-term solar and stellar variability is studied.  Thus, they
              use the full content of spectra to pursue a deeper understanding of several
              important issues; namely, (1) relative variability of the Sun and
              solar-analogous stars, (2) nature of 'Maunder Minimum' stars, (3) response of
              quiet and active lines to variability on different timescales, and (4) using
              these data as predictors of upcoming activity.
