Abstract    :
              This research focuses on new and continuing experimental tests of quantum
              electrodynamics and relativistic bound-state formalism in positronium.  Two
              systematic tests at the 200 ppm level will be made to address differences
              between the current value obtained by this group and the theoretical value. 
              High precision spectroscopy of positronium in excited states will be continued
              with measurement of the n=2 fine structure intervals.
