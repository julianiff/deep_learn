Abstract    :
              9731139  KNOX  This project will supply shipboard scientific equipment for the
              research vessels MELVILLE, NEW HORIZON, and R.G. SPROUL, operated by the
              Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and dedicated to use in support of ocean
              science research.    The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program
              provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe
              conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such 
              items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and
              retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars,
              gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin  point the location of research
              sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite
              transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment
              such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data
              retrieval sites.    The Project Director, Robert Knox is fully qualified to
              direct this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the
              acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.    This project will allow
              the institution to acquire a CTD block for general use, a differential GPS, two
              radars, a back up gyro and GMDSS equipment for the NEW HORIZON, and a
              differential GPS and two computers for the SPROUL.  ***
