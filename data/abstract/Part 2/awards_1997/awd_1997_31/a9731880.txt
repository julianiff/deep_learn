Abstract    :
               PHY-9731880- David Ellis, University of Toledo

 The "Research Experiences
              for Undergraduates" in the Physics Department of
 the University of Toledo
              will be continued. This program places eight
 students each summer in the
              research programs of the Department, which cover a number of topics in Physics
              and Astronomy.  The students will be given a number of opportunities to
              interact professionally.  Available research fields include astronomy,
              astrophysics, atomic physics, biophysics, condensed matter physics, materials
              science, and optics. Student projects will include a written report and an oral
              presentation of results.  Also, students will participate in a weekly seminar,
              with speakers including students, faculty, and visiting researchers.  Students
              will be recruited nationally, and free housing will be provided, so that
              students from various regions can meet each other and broaden their view of the
              diversity of physics programs in the U.S.  Group social activities and field
              trips will enhance students' overall experience.
