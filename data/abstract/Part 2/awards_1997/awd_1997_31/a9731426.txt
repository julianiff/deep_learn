Abstract    :
              9731426  Fleischman    Villanova University provides a 36-month Teacher and
              Student Development Through Research Experience project.  The project provides
              45 students entering grades 10 and 11 and 15 high school mathematics teachers
              with interdisciplinary research experiences involving mathematical modeling and
              computational analysis of biological systems.  Participant teams of 3 students
              and 1 teacher engage in research projects during a 5-week summer component. 
              The research activity continues during the academic year, using electronic
              communication to maintain contact between the teams and project faculty.  All
              participants return for a spring research symposium.  The project assists and
              supports teachers in adapting and transferring portions of the research
              experience into their classrooms.
