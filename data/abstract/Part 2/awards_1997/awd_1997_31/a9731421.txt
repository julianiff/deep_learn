Abstract    :
              KANTOR 9731421    The proposer will investigate  fast recognition algorithms for
              black box exceptional groups  of Lie type (research begun with K. Magaard), and
              finding the characteristic of  a black box group of Lie type (research begun
              with A. Seress).  These have  applications to upgrading all known Monte Carlo
              nearly linear permutation group  algorithms to Las Vegas algorithms, versions
              of which will then be programmed  into the group theory system GAP. Other
              consequences will be  very practical Sylow algorithms for permutation groups,
              which will also go into  GAP.    The field of group theory is the mathematical
              theory of symmetry and interacts with many other disciplines, for example
              physics and chemistry outside of mathematics, coding theory, number theory and
              geometry inside mathematics.The investigator's particular area is  finite
              groups, computation and applications to geometry and coding.
