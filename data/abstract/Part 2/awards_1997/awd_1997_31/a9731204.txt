Abstract    :
              9731204  Bejan    This award supports the participation of twelve US engineers
              in a US-South Africa Workshop on Energy and Environment, to be held in Durban,
              South Africa, in June 1998.  The co-organizers are Professor Adrian Bejan,
              Department of Mechanical Engineering, Duke University, Professor Peter Vadasz,
              Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Durban-Westville, Durban
              and Professor Detlev G. Kroger, Department of Mechanical Engineering,
              University of Stellenbosch.  The focus of the workshop is on thermal sciences,
              heat transfer technologies, and environmental phenomena associated with energy
              flows and installations.  The purpose of the workshop is to promote scientific
              collaboration between the two countries by exploring opportunities for joint
              research in specific topics of high priority to the scientific community.   
              Among the topics of discussion are engineering thermodynamics and
              refrigeration, energy engineering, and heat transfer augmentation.  In the
              environmental area, the two major topics are the environmental impact of energy
              systems, and convection in porous media.  South Africa is the world leader in
              the commercial production of synthetic liquid fuel (converted from coal) for
              motor vehicles.  South Africa also has the world's largest installed capacity
              of dry cooling towers.  These and other areas of technological leadership will
              be discussed by the South African participants.  This award is supported 
              jointly by the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems and the Division of
              International Programs.
