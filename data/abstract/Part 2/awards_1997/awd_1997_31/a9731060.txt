Abstract    :
               Mark Schell is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to study the theoretical and experimental   nonlinear
              behavior in electrochemical oxidation of alcohols.  The   nonlinear kinetic
              processes to be studied are the electrochemical   oxidations of alcohols in
              acid solution under the condition of constant   current.  Two fundamental
              problems will be addressed: 1) the   investigation of the fundamental chemical
              steps underlying temporal   instabilities during the elcetro-oxidation of
              methanol at a Pt electrode;   and 2) the development of new techniques for
              describing nonlinear kinetic   problems that are global in parameter space and
              phase space.  Much of the   proposed experimental work will center on the
              instabilities in the   electro-oxidation of methanol.  Preliminary experimental
              work has shown   this system to be tristable.  The PI will attempt to model
              this behavior   by theoretically deriving the potential vs. current curves and 
               oscillatory nonlinear behavior.  The proposed work has practical implications
              with regard to the   commercial feasibility of an ambient-temperature,
              methanol-air, fuel cell
