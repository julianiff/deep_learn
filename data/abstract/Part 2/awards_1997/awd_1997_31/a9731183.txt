Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      This project will construct  a camera for the near infrared region
              of the spectrum (1 micrometer to 2.5 micrometer wavelength) for use with the
              100 inch Hooker telescope and adaptive optical system, and the CHARA array at
              the Mount Wilson Observatory.  The camera will be applied to three
              complementary imaging techniques: interferometry, speckle imaging, and lunar
              occultation.
