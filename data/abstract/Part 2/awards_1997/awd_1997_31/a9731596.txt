This research at an RUI institution focuses on experiments
              to probe the internal structure of atoms with the aim of revealing correlations
              between classical and quantum physics.   Photoionization of laser-excited atoms
              and an accurate determination of quantum defect parameters will be pursued.  An
              expansion of recently initiated work on the creation and detection of coherent
              states will also be undertaken.  The research projects will involve
              undergraduate students, high school students, and high school teachers.
