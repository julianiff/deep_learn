Abstract    :
              AST-9731168      ABSTRACT  This project will build an inexpensive camera, the
              GRB imager and polarimeter (GRB-IMP),  which will be permanently mounted at the
              broken Cassegrain focus of the Palomar 200 inch  telescope.  It will be
              available to any observer with 10 minutes notice.  The GRB-IMP will  provide
              imaging capability via a CCD camera and rapid photometry using either
              photomultiplier  tubes, avalanche photodiodes, or a combination  of the two. 
              Availability of the GRB-IMP will maximize the possibility of acquiring adequate
               GRB follow-up observations at optical wavelengths.
