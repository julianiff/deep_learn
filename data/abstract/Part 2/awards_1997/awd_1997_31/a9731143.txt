Abstract    :
              9731143  HAHN   This project will support shipboard scientific support equipment
              for the research vessel ENDEAVOR, an NSF-owned ship operated by the University
              of Rhode Island, Graduate School of Oceanography and dedicated to use in
              support of ocean science research.         The Shipboard Scientific Support
              Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the
              proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides
              support   for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the
              deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such
              as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the location
              of research sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers and
              satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and other
              equipment such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from
              data retrieval sites.           The Project Director, William B. Hahn is fully
              qualified to direct this project having had considerable experience in
              overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.        
              This project will allow the institution to upgrade systems on the R/V ENDEAVOR
              including, bow thruster control, tank level indicators, ship drawings,
              antifouling system and the speed log.  ***
