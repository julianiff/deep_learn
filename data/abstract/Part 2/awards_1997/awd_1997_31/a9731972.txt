Abstract    :
                  9731972  Berry  This is a SGER award. The goal of the proposed research is
              to characterize the role of selective plant gene amplification in the
              development of nitrogen-fixing actinorhizal root nodules. It has been observed
              that nodule-specific, single-gene amplifications and rearrangements occur
              during the formation of root nodules of Datisca glomerata. Endopolyploidization
              has historically been reported to occur as a part of nodule organogenesis, but
              selective gene amplification is a very new finding. Moreover, a little is known
              about the function or regulation of gene amplification in plant development.
              This research will lay the groundwork for further studies into this new area of
              investigation. Selective gene amplification has parallels in diverse biological
              systems, including oncogene induction, and the proposed work may lead to our
              increased understanding on the developmental significance and evolutionary
              conservation of selective gene amplification among eukaryotic organisms.
