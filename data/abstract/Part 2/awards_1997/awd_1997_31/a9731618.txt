This work is a continuation of high-resolution spectroscopic
              measurements of the structure of high angular momentum Rydberg states of the
              helium atom and the hydrogen molecule.  The motivation for these studies is to
              stimulate and test improvements in fundamental atomic theory, particularly of
              few electron systems.
