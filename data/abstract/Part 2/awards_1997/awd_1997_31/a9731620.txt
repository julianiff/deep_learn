Abstract    :
                9731620  He    This award supports initiation of collaborative research on 
              testing concurrent software systems between the research  group led by Xudong
              He at North Dakota State University and  the research group led by Hong Zhu at
              Nanjing University in  China.  Professor He is an expert on formal methods for 
              concurrent systems and Professor Zhu is an expert on  software testing theory. 
              The goals of the project are to  develop a theory for testing concurrent
              software systems in  general and to develop a methodology specifically for 
              testing Hierarchical Predicate Transition nets.    Support on the Chinese side
              will be provided by the National  Natural Science Foundation of China.
