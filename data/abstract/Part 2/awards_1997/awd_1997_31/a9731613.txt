Abstract    :
              ***  9731613  Weinreich  This grant continues the theoretical and experimental 
              Musical Acoustics work that has gone on at the Physics  Department of the
              University of Michigan for well over  twenty years.  Specific study areas
              proposed for this  funding period include:       a) The physics of wind
              instruments, including a new  application of nonlinear dynamics and the
              analysis of time  series to an investigation of the degrees of freedom of 
              reeds, lip reeds, and vocal folds;       b) The "directional tone color" of
              violins, including  design of special "DTC loudspeakers" which mimic their 
              directional characteristics'       c) The physics of "dissected instruments"
              (in which a  computer link is inserted into the fast oscillation loop of  an
              instrument), including the coupling of a dissected violin  corpus to an actual
              violin;       d) Research into the directional characteristics of the 
              reverberation of a room, with particular applications to  architectural
              acoustics.  As in the past, this work has implications not only for 
              fundamental physical understanding and for the building of  better musical
              instruments, but also for other areas of  science such as nonlinear vibration
              analysis, wave  propagation, and psychoacoustics.  Its special merit in 
              educating physicists is that it constitutes the type of  research in which even
              undergraduates can be fruitfully  involved.  ***
