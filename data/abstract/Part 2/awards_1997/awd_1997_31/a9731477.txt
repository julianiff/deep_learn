Abstract    :
              This project studies the design and analysis of dynamic computer  processes. 
              Past research in theoretical computer science has  focused mainly on static
              computation problems, where the input is  known before the start of the
              computation and the goal is to  minimize the number of steps till termination
              with a correct  output.  Many important processes in today's computing are 
              dynamic processes, whereby input is continuously injected to the  system, and
              the algorithms is measured by its long term, steady  state, performance. 
              Examples of dynamic processes include  communication protocols, memory
              management tools, and time  sharing policies.  The goal of this project are:
              (1) To develop  new tools for analyzing the performance of dynamic processes,
              in  particular through modeling the dynamic process as an infinite  stochastic
              processes.  (2) Use the insight obtained from the  above analysis to obtain
              provably better algorithm for  fundamental dynamic processes such as (a)
              dynamic data  structures, (b) communication protocols, and (c) resource sharing
               protocols.  (3) Validate the analysis though simulations to  develop
              algorithms of both practical and theoretical interest.
