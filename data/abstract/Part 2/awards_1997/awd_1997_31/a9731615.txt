Abstract    :
              Undergraduates interested in research in field biology will  be selected to
              participate in a program at the University of  Michigan Biological Station in
              Pellston, MI.  Students will  both learn and live at the Station during the
              eight-week  summer session.  The research experience will be the sole  focus of
              their activities during that period.  Each selected  student will work with a
              faculty mentor, attend special  evening workshops, attend weekly discussion
              meetings, attend  general seminars at the Station, and develop his or her own 
              research project (from conception of  the ideas, through  collection of data,
              to verbal and written presentation of  the study).  Students will be selected
              on the basis of  academic excellence, letters of recommendation, and evidence 
              of interest in research.  After participation in the  program, each student
              will help in the evaluation of his or  her experience in the program.
