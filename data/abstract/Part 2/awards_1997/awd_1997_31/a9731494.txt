Abstract    :
              9731494  Person    This  project involves the development of a new mathematical 
              model  capable of representing the circulation of sea  water  through mid-ocean
              ridge systems near shallow magma chambers.  A  unique  feature of this model is
              its ability to represent  seawater   boiling   and   halite  precipitation   at
                high  temperatures. This model will be used to study the  chemical  and 
              isotopic  evolution of a well studied  mid-ocean  ridge  vent system at 9-10 N
              along the East Pacific Rise. This vent  system   was  discovered  and  sampled 
              shortly  after   the  emplacement  of  a shallow magma body; its  composition 
              and  temperature  have  changed dramatically over  the  past  few  years due to
              seawater boiling.
