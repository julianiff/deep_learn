Abstract    :
              OCE-9731304  Paduan    The project will analyze high-frequency (HF) radar data
              and  associated ocean surface phenomena.  The objectives are to:  1) document
              the seasonal evolution of sub-tidal current; 2)  relate observed wind to
              currents; 3) measure the vertical  current shear and relate to wind; and 4)
              improve and  characterize HF radar ocean current algorithms.
