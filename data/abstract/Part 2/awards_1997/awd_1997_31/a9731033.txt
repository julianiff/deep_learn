Abstract    :
                  9731033  Goldstein    This   proposal  requests  funds  for  a  petrological
                and  geochemical  study of a suite of basaltic samples  collected  from  the 
              Kolbeinsey  Ridge north of Iceland.   The  sample  suite to be studied was
              obtained by dredging at a very  high  spatial resolution.  The primary purpose
              of this study  will  be  to determine the Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic compositions
              of  these  samples, with He isotopes determined for a subset  of  the  samples.
               These data will be used to investigate mantle  flow  and  mixing processes
              that form the oceanic  crust  in  this  region  and  to  examine the nature  of
               ridge-hotspot  interactions.
