Abstract    :
              9731515  Knox    This award to the University of California at San Diego will
              provide instrumentation for oceanographic research on R/V Revelle, R.V
              Melville, R/V New Horizon and R/V Sproul, the four (4) research vessels
              operated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  It also
              provides instrumentation to the Scripps Oceanographic Data Facility, which will
              be used to support oceanographic research on various US and foreign vessels,
              and archive those data and maintain instrument calibration capabilities. 
              Specific instruments to be acquired include shipboard computers, disk drives
              for onshore archiving, tape systems for data archiving, instrumentation for
              supporting dissolved oxygen measurement, a synchronizer for seismic sources, a
              seismic sound source, streamer sections for seismic reflection recording, a
              pinger for locating the ocean bottom, slip rings, and calibration systems for
              pressure and temperature sensors and for meteorological sensors.  The
              shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist marine scientists conduct
              studies from the SIO vessels, support instrument calibraitons and archive data
              from throughout the world ocean in 1998 and in future years.
