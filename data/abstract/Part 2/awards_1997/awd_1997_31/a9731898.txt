Abstract    :
              97-31898  Paulin    The DESERT Project is a Local Systemic Change (LSC) project
              designed to change the way that science is taught throughout the Tucson Unified
              School District (TUSD) so that all students become scientifically literate. 
              The project is designed to build self-sustaining learning communities in
              collaboration with the University of Arizona and the business community in 94
              elementary and middle schools.     Clear science standards together with both
              district wide and site centered professional development will be provided for
              1,536 elementaryteachers, and 160 middle school teachers, and 94 principals (n
              = 1,790 teachers).  Schools as learning communities together with community
              links to the community will be accomplished through leadership and district
              wide site centered strands.  All strands are supported by Internet technology. 
                The district wide strands provide professional development to help teachers
              meet the needs of diverse learners.  This will be accomplished through a series
              of foundation courses (four) designed to provide teachers experience with
              inquiry and assessment strategies.  These will be supplemented with summer
              courses will develop a pedagogical base necessary for effective science
              instruction to diverse learners.    The site centered strand is designed to
              strengthen teachers in their instructional mode through study groups and action
              research that will empower them to assume responsibilities for their own
              professional development on a continuing basis.  Computer workstations will be
              provided in each teacher's classroom allowing access to the DESERT website
              containing information and learning tools to support and augment teaching.   
              Family science activities at each school with parents and pupils is designed to
              link the community and School closer together.  Science forums in partnership
              with university scientists will be conducted.  Businesses will inform and
              encourage their members to  support systemic change throughout the TUSD
              schools.
