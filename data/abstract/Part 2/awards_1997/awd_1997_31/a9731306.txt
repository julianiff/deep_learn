Abstract    :
              9731306  Czerniak  The University of Toledo (UT) and Bowling Green State
              University (BGSU) will partner with two public school districts, in a Local
              Systemic Change project, to achieve a system wide comprehensive reform of K-6
              science education in the schools.    Thirty-two support teachers from Toledo
              Public School (TPS) and suburban Springfield Local Schools (SLS) will be given
              full time release from teaching and will receive over 200 hours of training. 
              The Support teachers who will be carefully selected for their deep knowledge of
              science content will work in teams with scientists to provide assistance to the
              1476 classroom teachers, grades K-6.    All elementary teachers will attend
              summer institutes, which will be held at both universities.  Eight institutes,
              staffed by scientists and science educators from both UT and BGSU, will be
              offered each summer and approximately 45 teachers will be enrolled in each one.
               Scientists will also be involved in classroom activities and monthly meetings
              with teachers, during the academic year.  Over the five years of the project
              teachers will receive at a minimum over 100 hours of professional development
              to enhance the implementation of FOSS and STC instructional materials which
              have been selected by both districts.  Principals will participate in a one-day
              retreat with follow up sessions throughout the year.  Ohio proficiency tests
              will be used to determine student progress in science and as a component of
              project evaluation.    Each school will develop an action plan that involves
              the parents and the community.
