Abstract    :
                    Saumon, Didier  AST-9731438      Drs. Saumon, Rogers, and Iglesias will
              carry out a detailed theoretical study of cool white dwarf stars.  Their work
              will focus on the computation of opacities and the development of new models
              and synthetic spectra which will quantify the spectral evolution (the
              'cooling') and analysis of cool white dwarf spectra.  Their calculations will
              be extended to very low effective temperatures and the prediction of observed
              colors and magnitudes at these cool temperatures will be useful in the
              identification of the low-mass population seen in microlensing experiments.
