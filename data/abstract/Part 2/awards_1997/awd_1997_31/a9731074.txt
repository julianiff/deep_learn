Abstract    :
              Funding is requested to support the coordination of the NSF  Geospace
              Environment Modeling (GEM) workshops and to provide travel  support to key
              participants and students.  The workshops are held  typically during June in
              Snowmass, Colorado for 1 week, and often  a half day workshop is held during
              the Fall American Geophysical  Union meeting.  The goals of the workshops are
              identify and work  toward solutions of outstanding problems in several focused
              areas  of research which will contribute to the ultimate development of a 
              magnetospheric global circulation model.  The goal of the workshop 
              coordination is to provide organized forums to foster the  community-wide
              discussions and research needed to achieve the GEM  initiative goals.
