Abstract    :
                Danchi, William  AST-9731625      Dr. Danchi will carry out a program of
              high-angular resolution observations of dust and gas surrounding evolved stars,
              with the scientific goals of providing a detailed description of the
              morphology, kinematics, and physical conditions of material in the
              circumstellar regions out to 100 stellar radii away.  The program will make use
              of the UC Berkeley Infrared Spatial Interferometer to provide very high spatial
              resolution observations at 8 - 12 microns, and a non-redundant aperture masking
              technique in the near-infrared on the Keck telescope.  Results from these
              observations and their analysis will provide information on the process of mass
              loss in evolved stars.
