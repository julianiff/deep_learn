Abstract    :
                  9731506  Grove    This  work  will  involve  experimental  studies  aimed  
              at  understanding  the  conditions and  time  scales  of  mantle  melting 
              processes  beneath active ocean spreading  centers.  The  experiments  will 
              determine diffusion  rates  of  rare  earth, high field strength and large-ion
              lithophile elements  in  garnet and high-Ca clinopyroxene at elevated pressure
              (1  to  3  GPa)  and  temperature (1250oC - 1500oC)  conditions.  These are the
              conditions relevant for mantle melting beneath  mid-ocean  ridges.  The results
              of the experiments  will  be  used  to  estimate  the  time  scales  and 
              styles  of  melt  generation  processes.  To infer the nature of  the  melting 
              processes  we  will  analyze the element abundances  in  the  products of
              melting (mid-ocean ridge basalts) and the  solid  residues   left   behind 
              after  melt  extraction   (abyssal  peridotites).   The  experimental results 
              and  the  element  abundances in the natural samples will then be used as input
               to  models of melt production.  The primary unknown in these  melting  models
              is the solid state diffusion rates  for  the  elements, which will be provided
              by the experiments.
