Abstract    :
              9731813  COBURN    This project will provide support for shipboard scientific
              support equipment for the research vessels, KNORR and OCEANUS, operated by the
              Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and dedicated to use in support of ocean
              science research.        The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program
              provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe
              conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support  for such
              items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and
              retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars,
              gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research
              sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite
              transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment
              such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data
              retrieval sites.        The Project Director, Joseph L. Coburn is fully
              qualified to direct this project having had considerable experience in
              overseeing similar activities.        This project will allow the institution
              to obtain 28 anti exposure suits, 4 fire fighting suits, 2 computers, a
              dewatering pump, a welding machine, electronic charting software and an
              INMARSAT B.  for the KNORR.  It will also outfit  the OCEANUS with  two
              wireless radios and call logging software.  ***
