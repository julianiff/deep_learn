Abstract    :
              Abstract  9731384  Metzger    This project, sponsored by San Jose State
              University, is a five-year program which will help K-12 teachers in the San
              Jose Unified School District (SJUSD) to teach earth science. The project will
              serve 128 teachers, including at least two from each SJUSD school, and prepare
              32 teachers to become District leaders in earth science curriculum. Teachers
              and administrators will be exposed to the content of exemplary materials in
              earth science and the project will connect with on-going earth science projects
              in the schools. The program will consist of a two week summer workshop followed
              by extensive academic year activities. There will be a separate Leadership
              program. These teachers will have further content training, practice peer
              teaching and help program implementation in the SJUSD schools. Additional
              teachers will be served by the project through the academic year program and
              through mentoring by the lead teachers.    Matching funds constitute 20% of the
              NSF award.
