Abstract    :
              As  new  edge  detection papers appear, convincing proof  of  real  advantages  
              over  past  techniques  is  critical   to   community  recognition  and 
              acceptance.   This  requires  establishment   of  methods  to objectively and
              quantitatively demonstrate  whether  a  new algorithm offers performance
              improvements.  This research will  result  in  a  carefully  developed  and 
              documented  experimental  framework for edge detector evaluation by adaptively
              sampling edge  detector parameter space and generating ROC curves.  The 
              research  includes  documenting  how  well the results  of  the  pixel-level 
              evaluation agree with evaluations based on higher-level tasks such  as 
              perceptual  grouping, structure from motion and  human  object  recognition.  
              The  work will leave behind  the  artifacts  (image  sets,  software, )
              necessary for others to use, and to build upon,  the  research.   In
              particular, a web site will  be  created  that  promotes  the  use  of  this
              framework as  a  standard  technique.  Beyond  providing  a solution for
              performance evaluation  of  edge  detectors,  the  results  may  also  serve 
              as  a  model  for  the  development  of performance evaluation methods for
              other  computer  vision problems.
