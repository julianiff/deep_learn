Abstract    :
                Green, Elizabeth  AST  97-31655    In a collaborative effort, PIs Green and
              Liebert of the University of Arizona and PI Saffer of Villanova University will
              investigate the characteristics of binary systems among subdwarf B stars, the
              field counterparts to the extended and blue horizontal branch stars found in
              clusters.  Using precise new radial velocity observations, they will
              investigate the frequency of binaries and the distribution of orbital
              parameters and masses of components of the binary systems.  The ultimate goals
              of the research are to understand better the origin of subdwarf B stars, which
              make up the majority of very blue objects found in sky surveys and are an
              important contributor to the UV excesses observed in external galaxies, and, by
              analogy, the origin of the blue and extended horizontal branch stars seen in
              clusters.  ***
