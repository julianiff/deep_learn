Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    This grant supports a design study for the mid-infrared
              spectroscopic and imaging camera system designated MIRABU (Mid-InfraRed Array
              for Boston University).  The study will result in a complete, detailed design
              for MIRABU, a detailed cost estimate, and a detailed management plan for the
              construction and commissioning of the instrument.
