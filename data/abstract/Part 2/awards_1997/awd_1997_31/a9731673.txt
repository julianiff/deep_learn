Abstract    :
                Saffer, Rex  AST  97-31673    In a collaborative effort, PI Saffer of
              Villanova University and PIs Green and Liebert of the University of Arizona
              will investigate the characteristics of binary systems among subdwarf B stars,
              the field counterparts to the extended and blue horizontal branch stars found
              in clusters.  Using precise new radial velocity observations, they will
              investigate the frequency of binaries and the distribution of orbital
              parameters and masses of components of the binary systems.  The ultimate goals
              of the research are to understand better the origin of subdwarf B stars, which
              make up the majority of very blue objects found in sky surveys and are an
              important contributor to the UV excesses observed in external galaxies, and, by
              analogy, the origin of the blue and extended horizontal branch stars seen in
              clusters.  ***
