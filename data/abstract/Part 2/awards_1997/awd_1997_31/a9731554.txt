Abstract    :
              9731554  Freitag  This award to University of Rhode Island will provide
              instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/V Endeavor, a research
              vessel operated by the university's Graduate School of Oceanography as part of
              the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.
              Specific instrumentation to be acquired is a towed, undulating sensor package
              for oceanographic and biological measurements, as well a controls and computer
              interfacing.  The shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist marine
              scientists conduct studies, particularly in  the Northwest Atlantic Ocean, in
              1999 and future years.  ***
