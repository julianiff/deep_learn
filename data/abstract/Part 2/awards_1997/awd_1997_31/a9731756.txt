Abstract    :
                9731756  Glazman    Research will be conducted on the theory of correlated
              electron  transport in confined interacting electron systems with an aim to 
              elucidate the role of mesoscopic fluctuations. Work will focus on  capacitance
              fluctuations in quantum dots, mesoscopic fluctuations  in double-dot devices,
              mesoscopic fluctuations in a normal metal  grain connected to superconducting
              leads, and on many body  effects and mesoscopic fluctuations in coupled 2D-3D
              electronic  systems that may be realized by vertical tunneling into GaAs 
              heterostructures. The principal investigator plans an analytic  approach using
              various theoretical techniques to investigate  mesoscopic fluctuations in these
              systems; these include methods  of bosonization, effective action,
              renormalization group, as well  as diagrammatic techniques.  %%%  This
              theoretical research involves understanding quantum  mechanical processes and
              phenomena surrounding the transport of  electrons in electronic device-like
              structures that are  constructed on length scales between the atomic and the 
              macroscopic. This work will have immediate impact on the  interpretation of
              existing, and design of new, experiments  designed to elucidate the physics of
              electron transport in  mesoscopic devices. The study of these phenomena on 
              mesoscopic  and smaller length scales is expected to profoundly influence 
              emerging electronic device technologies of the next century.  ***
