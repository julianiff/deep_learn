This cooperative research award supports Jon Levin, Ivan Sellin,
              and students from their group at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville to
              collaborate with Dr. Henrik Cederquist of the Physics Department at Stockholm
              University, Sweden.  When an atomic ion in an excited state collides with a
              neutral atom, the resulting change of state of the incoming ion can be radiated
              away as a photon, or transferred to the neutral atom causing it to ionize
              (Penning radiation).  The U.S. group has developed an experimental technique
              that can, for the first time, separate the radiative and non-radiative
              contributions to the total cross section for quenching of the excited ion. 
              This new technique can measure branching rations and partial rates.  The
              Swedish group, which has world-class expertise in this area, will participate
              in extending the experiments to include several species of atom and molecule
              not yet used as targets.
