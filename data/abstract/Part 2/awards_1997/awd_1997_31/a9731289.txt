Abstract    :
                Description: This award is to support of a US scientific delegation to the
              US-Egypt Workshop on Priorities of Desert Studies, to be held in Cairo, Egypt,
              in March 1998.  The US organizer is Dr. Farouk El-Baz, Professor and Director,
              Center for Remote Sensing at Boston University, Boston, MA.  The Egyptian
              organizer is Dr. Mohamed Adel Yehia, Chairman, National Agency of Remote
              Sensing and Space Research (NARSS) in Cairo, Egypt.  The four day workshop will
              be held at the NARSS headquarters in Cairo.  The objectives of the workshop
              are: review the state of knowledge of the desert terrain with emphasis on
              establishing priorities of desert studies; exchange information between US and
              Egyptian scientists to encourage the development of cooperative projects; and
              the initiation of joint research proposals in areas of established high
              priority.  The topics to be discussed include: Remote sensing, hydrogeology and
              applied meteorology, geomorphology and applied tectonics, coastal zone studies,
              and integrated desert studies.  Scope:  This project will bring together 15
              well known American scientists, from different institutions, who are experts in
              various fields related to desert research, with their counterparts in Egypt to
              develop an agenda for joint research in areas of mutual interest.  Dr. El-Baz
              has had a long experience in field studies and remote sensing studies in
              various parts of the deserts in Africa and in the Arabian peninsula.  The
              Egyptian organizer, Dr. Yehia, is the head of the largest remote sensing center
              in the Arab countries, with extensive work experience in geological desert
              studies throughout the Middle East.  There is a plan to publish a proceedings
              covering the presentations and the recommended areas for joint US-Egypt
              research projects.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting joint
              U.S.-foreign workshops that are likely to significantly increase collaboration
              in areas of mutual interest.
