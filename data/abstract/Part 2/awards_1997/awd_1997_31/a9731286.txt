Abstract    :
              Harpole  ESI 97-31286    This is a three year project to involve teams of middle
              school students and teachers in research focused on the Mississippi Delta
              Management Systems Evaluation Area I (MESA) project. Each year 10 teachers from
              the Mississippi Delta and 20 of their high potential students will participate.
              They will spend three weeks working with MESA scientists during the summer in
              field and laboratory settings and one week at Mississippi State University
              working in a research laboratory. Teams attend four follow-up session during
              the academic year and use the Internet for ongoing communications. The academic
              year follow-up includes acquisition of new data as they update themselves on
              their research project. The remaining time is devoted to transfer of the
              research experience into the classroom and changed teaching practices. The
              project selects one teacher and two students from a school.
