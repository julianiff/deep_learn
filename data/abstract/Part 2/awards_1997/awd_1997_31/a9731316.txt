Abstract    :
              ESI  9731316    This Local Systemic Change proposal is submitted by a
              partnership involving 5 school districts in collaboration with scientists and
              science educators from the University of Rhode Island.  The project will offer
              high quality professional development to 350 teachers, grades K-8, in 29
              schools.   Ten Kindergarten Science Resource teachers will be among these
              participants.   Inquiry based kits from well established curriculum projects,
              FOSS and STC, have been selected for implementation grades K-6 and will be
              delivered to teachers and refurbished by the regional instructional materials
              Resource Center used by the KITES project.    The extension of the common
              science curriculum to grades 7 and 8 has been accomplished in partnership with
              high school science department chairs and middle school science teachers.   The
              middle school curriculum changes will be led by a group of 10 middle school
              science teachers exploring the extension of the common science curriculum into
              grades 7 and 8, with SEPUP instructional materials being considered for
              implementation.  Science mentors recruited from the university and the private
              sector will partner with elementary teachers.  The project will have
              significant impact on elementary and secondary teacher preparation as materials
              and curriculum used with the preservice teachers will be adapted for use in
              science methods courses.  Computers and connections are available in all five
              districts to facilitate networking among teachers.   The request is for $1,047,
              908 for 5 years with cost sharing estimated as $1,166,823.
