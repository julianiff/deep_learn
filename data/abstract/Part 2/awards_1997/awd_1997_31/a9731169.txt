Abstract    :
                9731169  Kibblewhite    An adaptive optics system and laser guide-star will be
              integrated with the 3.5 meter telescope of the Astrophysical Research
              Consortium (ARC) at Apache Point, NM.  Many of the components of the system
              have been developed under earlier grants.  Performance of these components will
              be optimized for use in the proposed system.    Field tests will be carried out
              with the dual YAG, sum frequency. laser to optimize the size and brightness of
              the beacon generated in the mesospheric sodium layer.  The laser is expected to
              generate a sub-arcsecond beacon as bright as a 7.5 magnitude star in the V
              band.    The laser and a beam director will be integrated with the ARC
              telescope, the adaptive optical system, wavefront sensor, H band infrared
              camera, and telescope control computers.  ***
