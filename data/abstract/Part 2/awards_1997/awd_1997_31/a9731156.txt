Abstract    :
                    Dinerstein, Harriet  AST-9731156      Dr. Dinerstein will carry out a
              program of spectroscopic observations to search for manifestations of shock
              activity in the spectra of planetary nebulae.  While shocks and hydrodynamical
              processes are considered to be the primary mechanisms for the formation and
              evolution of the structure of planetary nebulae, the instantaneous thermal and
              ionization/chemical equilibria are still primarily treated as determined by
              radiative processes.  The PI will re-examine the overall contribution of shocks
              to the observed spectra of planetary nebulae.  Her observational work will
              provide new tests and constraints for the hydrodynamical models and will
              distinguish photo-ionized from shock-heated contributions to the observed
              spectrum, allowing a more accurate determination of nebular properties such as
              the density, mass, and composition of the emitting gas.    ***
