Abstract    :
              Robert Cave of Harvey Mudd College, a RUI institution, is supported by   the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the Division of   Chemistry
              to investigate electronic coupling elements in electron   transfer reactions. 
              He will use his own recently published methods to   treat ground and excited
              state electron transfer reactions in a variety   of systems of experimental
              interest.  He will address orientation and   distance dependences of electronic
              coupling with and without solvent,   superexchange processes in hydrogen-bonded
              transition metal adducts, and   effects of thermal averaging and dielectric
              continuum electrostatics on   the electronic coupling matrix element.   
              Electron transfer processes play an important role in a wide variety of  
              chemical reactions, such as photosynthesis.  The ubiquity and importance   of
              these reactions in organic and inorganic chemistry has led to   concerted
              experimental and theoretical research attempting to unravel the   details of
              this simplest of chemical reactions.  Sophisticated electronic   structure
              methods in combination with molecular dynamics simulations are   being used in
              this study to characterize donor-acceptor electron coupling   in electron
              transfer reactions.
