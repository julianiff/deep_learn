              During the 1990s, auction theory has been asked to provide guidance to policy
              makers in two important areas: the design of Treasury auctions (and other
              auctions of multiple units of a homogeneous good), and the design of FCC
              auctions (and other auctions of heterogeneous items). Unfortunately, the
              received theory has largely focused on auctions of a single object, and so has
              had relatively little to say about these two empirically-relevant auction
              design problems.  Recent research has begun to expand the boundaries of auction
              theory and analysis so as to encompass these two important multiple-item
              auction problems, by studying the theoretical properties of existing multi-unit
              auction formats, empirically evaluating the spectrum auctions, and proposing
              new methods and applications of auctions. The current project builds upon the
              principal investigators' recent work in this area, by examining the following
              topics:    Equilibria of multi-unit auctions where each bidder's valuation
              depends on other bidders' information.  Auctions with resale markets or pure
              common values.  Efficient information revelation versus tacit collusion in
              dynamic auctions.  Extent of simultaneous versus sequential sale when selling
              multiple items.  Empirical analysis of the U.S. Treasury auctions.  Continuing
              evaluation of the spectrum auctions as well as evaluation of electricity
              auctions.    The project provides a balance of further theoretical development
              of multiple-item auctions and empirical testing of the ideas of auction theory.
              This blend of theoretical and empirical work, with both tied closely to auction
              practice, has been especially productive.    ***
