Abstract    :
              Funds are provided for a high-resolution analysis of the nature and volume of
              gas hydrates and carbonate mineralization across the Oregon accretionary
              complex. The research will define spatial and volumetric carbonate gas-hydrate
              and carbonate presence in a corridor spanning a hydrate province of the Oregon
              margin. Side scan sonar and high-resolution seismic reflection work will map
              the surface and subsurface hydrates, centered on ODP site 892. These data will
              allow to assess the distribution of fluid venting. In addition, drilling of up
              to 100 m cores are planned  in depths of 2000 m to obtain samples for elemental
              and isotopic analyses of the gas phase, pore waters, solid hydrate and
              carbonates. The cores will be obtained by a newly developed portable remotely
              operated drill (PROD).
