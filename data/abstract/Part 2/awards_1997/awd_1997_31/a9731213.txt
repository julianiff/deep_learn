Abstract    :
              9731213  Wilson    This award provides funds to support a six month research 
              visit by Dr. W. Stephen Wilson, Department of Mathematics,  Johns Hopkins
              University, for collaboration with Professor  Goro Nishida, Division of
              Mathematics, Graduate School of  Science, Kyoto University, Japan.  The
              collaborators will  attempt to prove a conjecture on the unstable
              Brown-Peterson  homology of spaces.  This conjecture was first made nearly  20
              years ago in the USA by American and Japanese  mathematicians.  In recent
              collaboration between U.S. and  Japanese mathematicians, significant progress
              has been made  on the problem, and the PI and his collaborators have  sketched
              an approach which is expected to resolve the  question.    The conjecture
              states that n-dimensional elements in the  Brown-Peterson homology of a space
              are an n-th type of  torsion free.  The collaborators will translate the
              problem  into classifying spaces for a cohomology version and then  prove
              various homotopy decomposition theorems  Solution of  the problem will be of
              mutual benefit to U.S. and Japanese  mathematicians.  This project is supported
              under the Science  Fellowship Program between the National Science Foundation 
              and the Japan Foundation Center for Global Partnership.  ***
