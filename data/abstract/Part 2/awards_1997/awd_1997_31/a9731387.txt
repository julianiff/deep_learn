Abstract    :
              9731387  Weaver    This five year program will provide summer research
              opportunities for teachers with the university or other research groups around
              the region.  These research opportunities will last for a minimum of eight
              weeks. The projects will be in the discipline areas of biology, chemistry,
              physics, and earth sciences.   It is expected that there will be no less than
              22 teachers in the project each year.  In addition to the summer research
              projects the teachers will be expected to participate in academic year
              follow-up sessions to assist with implementation of what was learned in the
              summer research to their classes.  Some funds will be available for the
              teachers to purchase supplies and to attend professional meetings.   The 
              project will begin operation in the summer of 1998 and is expected to run
              through the summer of 2002 and into the academic year.  The project is
              providing $1,013,195 in both gifts in kind and actual money which represents 
              204%  of the award amount of the project.
