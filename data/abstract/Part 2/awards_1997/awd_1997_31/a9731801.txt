Abstract    :
              9731801  Goad    This award to University of Texas will provide  instrumentation
              of oceanographic research for use on R/V  Longhorn, a research vessel operated
              by University of Texas  marine Science Institute as part of the
              University-National  Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  Specific 
              instruments to be acquired include weather station  instrumentation and new
              transducers for the echosounder. The  shared-use instrumentation supported here
              will assist marine  scientists conduct studies from R/V Longhorn in the Gulf of
               Mexico in 1998 and in future years.
