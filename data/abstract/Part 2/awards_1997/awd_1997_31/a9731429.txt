Abstract    :
              ESI 97-31429  Oberhauser    This is a proposed three-year outreach that will
              engage teachers and students in long-term research partnerships incorporating
              NRC Standards.  It is designed to enhance the capability of both middle and
              high school teachers incorporate formal research practices into their science
              classrooms.  Project activities include experimental design, data collecting,
              data analysis, and science collaboration as teams throughout the eastern United
              States.    The research focus will be the monarch butterfly.  Results of the
              research into the monarch butterfly will provide baseline knowledge that will
              help and guide conservation efforts.  It will also enrich the body of monarch
              butterfly research data currently available.    There will be a total of 60
              teachers and 120 students involved over the term of the project (i.e., three
              years).  Teachers and students will work in teams (i.e., one teacher and two
              students).  Special emphasis will be given to recruiting teachers with
              leadership qualities and in representation of urban, suburban, and rural
              schools, as well as a variety of cultural socioeconomic backgrounds.     
              Project evaluation will be undertaken by the University of Minnesota Center for
              Applied research and Educational Improvement (CAREI).  Dissemination of the
              project's work will be disseminated through presentations at local and national
              meetings, "teacher best practices circles," development of a Monarch Monitoring
              Resource packet and CD-ROM, on-line resources, and a fee-based institute.
