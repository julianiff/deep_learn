Abstract    :
                9731222  Liu    The proposed research project represents a joint effort by 
              U.S. and Chinese researchers to establish the tsunami  modeling and mitigation
              capablility in China.  A numerical  model developed by the U.S. investigator
              will be used to  investigate the impact of tele-tsunamis generated in the 
              Pacific seismic rim on the China coast.  The effects of the  continental shelf
              and the offshore island chain will be  examined.  By so doing, a database for
              bathymetry and  topography along the China coast will also be established  and
              will be available to the international research  community.  The second task of
              the poposed reseach project  is to study the 1992 Hainan island tsunami.  Since
              there are  five tidal gage records available for the event, it is an  ideal
              situation to test the hydrodynamic inverse algorithm  for determining the
              seismic parameters in the source region.    The P.I. of the proposed research
              project is Professor  Phillip L.F. Liu, School of Civil and Environmental 
              Engineering at Cornell University.  A half-time graduate  student will assist
              on the project.  The Chinese  investigators are Mr. Yu Fujiang and Ms. Ye Lin
              of the  National Marine Environmental Forecast Center of China.  The  duration
              of the research is 24 months.
