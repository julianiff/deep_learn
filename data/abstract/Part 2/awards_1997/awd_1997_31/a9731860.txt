Abstract    :
              9731860  Mayo    Penn State University will continue a Research Experience for 
              Undergraduates (REU) site in its Materials Science and  Engineering department.
              Undergraduate students will be recruited  from the 19 Penn State Commonwealth
              campuses throughout the state  of Pennsylvania. Students will participate in
              research projects  on the theme of "Materials Stability and Reliability",
              including  nanophase ceramics, epitaxial oxides, semiconductor-metal  contacts,
              metal-insulator composites, and wafer bonding. In  addition, REU participants
              will attend weekly seminars and tours.  %%%  The REU site, with a regional
              focus whereby high quality  undergraduates will be recruited from the state of
              Pennsylvania,  will provide a research experience to students who would not 
              normally have access to a research environment.  ***
