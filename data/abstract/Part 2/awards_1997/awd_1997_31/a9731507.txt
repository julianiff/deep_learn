Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to determine  the algebraic
              structure of solutions of differential and  difference equations.  In
              particular, the project seeks to find a  complete efficient algorithm to
              compute the Galois groups of  differential equation and specific algorithms to
              compute  properties of the equations as reflected in these groups (e.g., 
              solvability in finite terms and solvability in terms of lower  order
              equations).  Refined criteria will be sought that will  allow one to construct
              differential equations with a specified  Galois group and extend the existing
              solution for connected  linear algebraic groups to arbitrary linear algebraic
              groups.  The recently developed Galois theory of difference equations will  be
              applied to similar problems for these equations as well.  In  particular,
              effective algorithms will be developed to determine  if difference equations
              can be solved in finite terms, greatly  generalizing the work of Petkovsek,
              Wilf, and Zeilberger.  Furthermore, algorithms will be developed to determine
              the Galois  groups of such an equation, and a constructive solution of the 
              inverse problem for these equations will be obtained.
