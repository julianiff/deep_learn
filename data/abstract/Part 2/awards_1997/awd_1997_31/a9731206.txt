Abstract    :
              9731206  Manson  Description:  This award supports the US-India  Cooperative
              Research: Ionization of Atoms by  Electromagnetic Radiation and Charged 
              Particles."  Collaborators Steven Manson of  Georgia State University and
              Pranawa Deshmukh  of the Indian Institute of Technology(IIT),  Madras will
              continue to research problems  involving theoretical calculations of the 
              interaction of various kinds of ionizing  radiation with atomic and ionic
              matter.  They  will emphasize regions which have not been  explored
              experimentally.  With the advent of  the new powerful synchrotron light
              sources,  including one in India, these systems will be  more readily explored
              in the laboratory, thus  making the proposed studies quite timely.    Scope: 
              The results will provide further  insight into the basic nature of fundamental 
              atomic processes which are important in plasma  physics, atmospheric, solar and
              astrophysics,  and radiation physics.  In both countries, the  research
              provides training for graduate and  advanced undergraduate students in methods
              of  calculating and understanding atomic and  molecular structure and
              collisions.   Additionally, for India the  collaboration  facilitates the
              build-up of an internationally  competitive research program at the IIT, 
              Madras.        ***
