Abstract    :
              9731031  Fulthorpe  This award will support a marine seismic reflection program
              to  examine the interplay of global (eustacy) and local (tectonics,  sediment
              supply rate and ocean currents) controls responsible for  continental margin
              sediment deposition and cyclicity. The  Canterbury Basin, on the eastern margin
              of the South Island of New  Zealand, is an excellent location in which to study
              these  controlling environmental factors. High rates of Neogene sediment 
              supply have resulted in the preservation of an unusually high  frequency (0.5-1
              m.y. periodicity), seismically resolvable record  of depositional cyclicity.
              Progradation and aggradation have  produced depositional sedimentary geometries
              with internal  structures that are well-preserved and unplaned by erosion. High
               resolution multi-channel seismic data will be collected and  analyzed during a
              field program using the R.V Ewing operated by  Lamont-Doherty Earth
              Observatory. In addition to basic scientific  analysis to be derived from the
              data, this research will also be  used to plan future drilling by the
              international Ocean Drilling  Program.  ***
