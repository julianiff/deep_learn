Abstract    :
                    9731278   Copeland    The Technology Education Leadership Project (TELP)
              provides two-week leadership development workshops for 90 Maryland technology
              education teachers during the summers of 1998 and 1999. The workshops include
              technical instruction in the nine core technologies in the Maryland curriculum
              framework for technology education: mechanical, electrical, electronic,
              structural, fluid, optical, thermal, bio, and materials. The leadership
              workshops also include instruction in facilitative leadership, information
              systems, and the teaching/learning strategies used in Maryland technology
              education courses: investigation; modular technology activity packages; topic
              investigations; engineering design and development; product generation; and
              research and experimentation.     Four weekend institutes supplement the summer
              workshops during each of the three years of the project. These sessions deal
              with the implementation of the core technologies and the teaching/learning
              strategies outlined above, the use of instructional technology, standards for
              technology education, and the planning, delivery, and assessment of the teacher
              enhancement programs in each of the school districts. These weekend workshops
              meet in locations across the state.    During each of the second and third
              summers, the leadership group of master teachers provides five days of teacher
              enhancement activities in each of the school districts across the state. This
              instruction covers the core technologies, information systems,
              teaching/learning strategies and instructional technology.
