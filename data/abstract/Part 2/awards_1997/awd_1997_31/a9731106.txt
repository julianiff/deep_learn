Abstract    :
              AST- 9731106                                                               
              Abstract                                                                     
              Funds will be used to expand the pulsar system now in Green Bank  to provide
              the full arsenal of data acquisition that has been  demonstrated by the
              Berkeley and CalTech groups.  The wider  bandwidth incoherent system will
              improve the sensitivity of high  frequency polarimetry by a factor of 2.5, will
              allow sensitive  searches for new pulsars, and provide new capability for
              single  pulse studies.  The voltage recording system brings a unique 
              capability to Green Bank for precision timing, searches at very  large
              dispersion measure and very high time resolution studies of  individual pulses.
               A 1-GHz Acousto-Optical Spectrometer will be  developed for pulsar studies. 
              This can be used to study  diffractive scintillation and real-time steering of
              other  recordings to scintillation maxima.
