Abstract    :
                AST 97-31656  Kenneth Janes    Dr. Janes is observing five nearby open star
              clusters with approximate ages greater than 2,000,000,000 years.  The goal of
              the project is to determine the fundamental properties, particularly the ages,
              of stars in these five open clusters.      Perhaps the greatest uncertainties
              in the ages of star clusters are the uncertainty in the distance scale and the
              difficulty in determining interstellar reddening.  The distance scale (from the
              nearest stars to the edge of the Universe) depends and builds upon the
              fundamental determination of stellar parallax.  The availability of the new
              Hipparcos Catalog with its precise parallaxes makes it possible to resolve some
              of these uncertainties - especially for open clusters.  Because there are large
              numbers of nearby Population I main-sequence stars, many of which have better
              determined parallaxes than the subdwarfs, and because the standard star color
              systems are defined by many of those same parallax stars, it is possible to do
              a better job of tying the old open cluster distance scale to the Hipparcos than
              can be done with globular clusters.     The PI is obtaining new high precision
              photometry of these five clusters, and also developing improved analysis tools
              to reduce the data.  The five clusters span the age of the Milky Way disk, so
              they are well matched to the problem.  The project depends upon large numbers
              of observations on moderate aperture telescopes combined with careful and
              extensive calibrations.  Regular photometric monitoring of open cluster stars
              will make it possible to identify many, if not most, of the non-member stars,
              as well as variable stars and binaries.  Other interesting stellar phenomena
              might be found and characterized:  delta Scuti stars, reflection effects in
              close (but non-eclipsing) systems, and eclipsing systems with secondary
              components perhaps as small as Jupiter.  ***
