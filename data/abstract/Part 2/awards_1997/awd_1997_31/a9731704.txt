Abstract    :
              The investigators continue studying ionospheric electrodynamics from equatorial
              to midlatitudes using incoherent scatter radar and Fabry-Perot interferometer
              measurements, as well as global convection, thermospheric, and ionospheric
              numerical models.  They attempt to understand electrodynamic and neutral
              atmospheric transport processes, test global convection and ionospheric
              circulation models, and develop global predictive storm-time dependent
              self-consistent ionospheric electric field and thermospheric neutral wind
              models.  The project consists of two components:  (1) studying storm-time
              dependent response of ionospheric and thermospheric transport processes using
              extensive incoherent scatter radar observations and nighttime Fabry-Perot
              interferometer data, and (2) studying the variability of electrodynamic
              processes using new radar and Fabry-Perot data with largely enhanced data
              taking and analysis techniques.
