Abstract    :
              9731543  Sanford  This award to University of Washington will provide support to
              complete software development and carry out field tests of the recently built
              version of the  "Towed Transport Meter," an instrument which uses electric
              field data measured from an instrument towed behind a ship to measure ocean
              currents.  A goal of this development is to provide a system which may be
              operated with minimal operator involvement, and hence may be used on ships of
              opportunity on which ocean research is not the primary mission.  Testing will
              be carried out in the vicinity of the Gulf Stream off Florida, where a strong
              current signal and ancillary data may be used to confirm the operational status
              and calibration.  ***
