Abstract    :
              The focus of computational geometry is designing algorithms for  solving
              geometric problems.  These arise in a number of  application contexts,
              including manufacturing, graph drawing,  robotics, and graphics.  The project's
              concentrations touch on  all these application areas.  Research on shortest
              paths and  geodesics on polytopes is relevant to robotics and to texture 
              mapping in graphics.  Folding and unfolding of research is  connected to a
              variety of manufacturing concerns.  And visibility  algorithms see use in
              graphics and graph drawing.    A collection of fundamental open problems in
              these areas will be  pursued, both theoretically and through experimentation
              with  code.  Progress on geodesics, on folding, on floodlight  illumination,
              and on visibility graphs can be expected.  Female  undergraduate students will
              be engaged in all aspects of the  research, and all software developed will be
              freely distributed  on the Internet.
