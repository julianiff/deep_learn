Abstract    :
              This research project in theoretical computer science  focuses on problems in
              two interrelated areas:  algorithms  for graph problems, and the design of data
              structures.  The  common theme is the investigation of efficient computation 
              in these area.  The goals are to generate improved  techniques, and
              characterize significant complexity  relationships.  A central issue is the
              efficient  coordination of the acquisition of information during a  complex
              computational task.  Three problems concerning  graphs are being investigated: 
              (1) balancing competing demands.  An example is finding a  spanning tree of a
              graph subject to balancing mutually  contending terms in the objective
              function.  (2)The  sensitivity of algorithmic solutions to changes in the 
              problem input. (3) Search strategies for relocatable objects  in graphs.  In
              addition, the project investigates data  structures for dynamic maintaining of
              information about  graphs.
