Abstract    :
              9731956  Schaeffer      This award supports research on systems of nonlinear
              partial  differential equations which model plasma behavior.  In particular a 
              kinetic model of plasma in which the density of ions in phase space  satisfies
              the Landau-Fokker-Planck equation is considered.  A major  focus is to develop
              finite difference schemes which correctly track the  transport effects.  In the
              case where collisions are neglected, particle  methods are widely used, but the
              computation of the collision operator  may be carried out more easily on a
              regular grid.  Hence the interest in  a finite difference method.  The goals
              here are to study both the  results of implementing such methods and analysis
              of convergence (as  feasible).  The starting point for this work is the context
              in which  solutions have spherical symmetry.  An additional problem of interest
              is  the Vlasov-Einstein system in which the relativistic motion of matter is 
              coupled to the Einstein field equations.
