Abstract    :
              ***  9731604  The Physics Department at Rensselaer will continue a REU  Site
              program for weeks to be held in each summer from 1998  to 2000.  The program
              will involve 10 undergraduate  students, at least six from other institutions,
              to  participate in frontier physics research by pairing up with  senior
              graduate students under the supervision of  experienced faculty members.  The
              available projects cover a  variety of topics including Astrophysics, Condensed
              Matter  Physics, Optical Physics, Particle and Nuclear Physics, and  Innovative
              Undergraduate Physics Education.  Our philosophy  of the undergraduate research
              project is to let the students  experience the challenge, the excitement, and
              sometimes  frustrations in research outside the lecture room.  The  final goal
              is to attract and encourage talented students  into careers in science and
              engineering.  ***
