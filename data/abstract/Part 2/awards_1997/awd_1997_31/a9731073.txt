The Department of Bioengineering at the University of Toledo
              will purchase a flow cytofluorimetry system that will be dedicated to support
              research in engineering.  Flow cytometry is now a standard technique in
              cellular engineering and the need for this equipment is both immediate and
              long-term for support of the Department.  The equipment will be used for
              several projects, including in particular:  the identification and
              characterization of cells involved in neovascularization of bioartificial
              organs, the quantification of genetic variations within a tumor cell population
              treated with photodynamic therapy, the study of the control of gene expression
              in bacteria, and the investigation of the effects of osmotic stress on antibody
              production in hybridomas.
