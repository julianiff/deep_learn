The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Middle Tennessee
              State University proposes a 4-year enhancement program for physics teachers.
              The pedagogical basis for the program is the national project "Constructing
              Physics Understanding (CPU) in a Computer Supported Learning Environment"
              developed at San Diego State University with the support of the National
              Science Foundation.  Modules have been developed for Light and Color,  Static
              Electricity and Magnetism, Current Electricity, Motion and Forces, Waves and
              the the Small Particle Model.  A faculty team from Tennessee has attended the
              sessions in San Diego delivered by Professor F. Goldberg, the PI on the CPU
              project.  This team will work with the 75 physics teachers.

During a 6-week
              period spanning two summers, with follow up meetings during the academic year,
              teacher participants will complete 4 modules of the CPU program and practice
              discovery laboratory activities that complement CPU.
