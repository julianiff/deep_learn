Abstract    :
              This project concerns the problem of reconstructing a two-  dimensional surface,
              such as the outside of a real object, from a  collection of sample points.  The
              problem is important for  building models in computer graphics, and in other
              areas of  science and engineering. A new algorithm has been developed  which is
              provably correct and efficient, based on the Delaunay  triangulation of the
              samples.  An innovative aspect of the  algorithm is that the samples do not
              have to be evenly  distributed over the object - detailed areas can be sampled 
              densely and smooth areas can be sampled sparsely. The basic  algorithm will be
              tested in various applications, each requiring  different extensions or
              modifications, and the application  of the theory to other problems in
              geometric modeling will be  studied.
