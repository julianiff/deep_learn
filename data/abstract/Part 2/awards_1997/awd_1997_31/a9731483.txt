Abstract    :
              9731483  Merlino    GREATER PHILADELPHIA SECONDARY MATHEMATICS PROJECT    The
              five-year Greater Philadelphia Secondary Mathematics Project brings together
              the Philadelphia Regional Center for the Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP)
              at La Salle University, the New Jersey State Systemic Initiative, the
              Philadelphia Urban Systemic Initiative, and other partners with 27 schools to
              implement standards-based change in secondary mathematics teaching and
              learning.       As a Local Systemic Change through Teacher Enhancement in
              Mathematics, Grades 7-12, project, approximately 600 mathematics teachers of
              grades 6-12 in selected schools/districts in Philadelphia, southeastern
              Pennsylvania, and southern New Jersey - essentially all within an hour's drive
              of Philadelphia - will have engaged in 130 - 240 hours of professional
              development centered around NSF-supported instructional materials (primarily
              IMP, Mathematics in Context, or Visual Mathematics) by the conclusion of the
              project.   The teacher enhancement curriculum also emphasizes use of graphics
              calculators and Geometer's Sketchpad, and supports selected teachers in
              reformed calculus, AP statistics, and Agriculture-based mathematics for high
              school students.      Cost sharing, which approximates 50% of the NSF request,
              is derived primarily from participating schools/districts.  Total commitments
              from partner schools are expected to exceed 292% of the NSF request.
