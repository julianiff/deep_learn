Abstract    :
              Nonsmooth optimization problems involve objectives or constraints  which are not
              differentiable everywhere.  The term  structured nonsmooth optimization means
              that the specific  nonsmooth nature of the problem is known.  One especially 
              interesting class repeatedly arises in many applications:  problems involving
              eigenvalues of matrices.  The project  primarily focuses on various aspects of
              eigenvalue optimization,  including semidefinite programming, quasiconvex
              eigenvalue  optimization, and non-Lipschitz eigenvalue optimization.    The
              goal is fourfold: the development of fast, robust numerical  algorithms; 
              analysis of theoretical questions concerning  optimality conditions and
              algorithm convergence; development of  software which can be used by the
              general scientific community;  and application to the solution of important
              interesting problems  which arise in practice.
