Abstract    :
                   This Minority Starter Grant is on mechanisms underlying the  function of
              biological clocks.  Periodic timing of behavior is  often regulated by cellular
              activity that is considered to act as  a biological clock.  Recent work has
              identified some of the  proteins that are released as components of the timing
              mechanism,  but it remains unclear how these proteins exert their effects on 
              target cells elsewhere.  This project uses a system of cultured  tissue
              isolated from the fruitfly, Drosophila, which allows the  potential for
              powerful genetic analysis of physiological  mechanisms.  Biochemical analyses
              are used to identify the timing  of protein secretions and hormone secretions
              from this tissue.  Results will show how molecular rhythms of clock gene
              expression  can result in timed behavior patterns.     This independent
              research follows NSF postdoctoral support, and  will have a high impact on
              giving the PI a significant early boost  to her career.  This work also is
              likely to have an impact on both  neuroscience and endocrinology in further
              understanding the  cellular mechanisms that link brain and hormonal secretions.
