Abstract    :
              This research is being done in conjunction with IIS-9732562, which is
              being
performed by Dorrit Billman in the Psychology Department at
              Georgia
Institute of Technology.  The research is concerned with
              intelligent
decision aids that can be developed by data mining techniques. 
              Experience
has determined that such systems can learn accurate models,  but
              that
experts in areas where those models are used in decision aids are
              often
reluctant to trust them because they do not, for instance, use the
              same
tests intermediate conclusions or abstractions that the experts have
              grown
to trust.  Or they do not use certain factors at all that experts feel
              to
be relevant.  Experts also want models that are stable under small
              changes
in the data being analyzed.  Psychologists have discovered factors
              that
simplify the learning, understanding, and communication of category
              and
process information by humans.  This research seeks to explore
              these
psychological principles in light of the output of existing KDD
              algorithms
and then go on to develop and evaluate new KDD algorithms that will
              provide
output that is easy for people to learn , use, and communicate to
              others.
With the results of this research, it should be possible to make
              such
decision aids more "human centered", so that they will be used more
              often
and more effectively in
              practice.
