Abstract    :
              9731735    The objectives of this project are to improve understanding of 
              atmospheric dynamics and to demonstrate the feasibility of  numerical 
              simulation of particular laboratory fluid flows.  This grant  enables a post- 
              doctoral scientist whose expertise is in numerical simulation of  geophysical
              fluid dynamics to collaborate with an expert in  laboratory  experiments in
              fluid flows at Cambridge, U.K.  The research  concentrates  on two main
              problems of atmospheric interest.  The first is to  explore the  effects of
              variable vertical forcing and variable stratification on  vortices in  the
              flow.  The second is to explore the effects of large-scale  horizontal  shear,
              time-dependent forcing, and the dispersion of passive  tracers.  This  award is
              in response to a proposal submitted under the guidelines  of the  Small Grants
              for Exploratory Research option because of its  preliminary  nature, urgency,
              and new, untested approach to interactive  simultaneous  numerical and
              laboratory simulation.
