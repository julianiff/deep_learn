Abstract    :
              Investigators make detailed numerical simulations of highly turbulent convection
              in resolving the yield interactions of rotation and convection play in
              differential rotation in solar-like stars.  Such simulations with very high
              spatial resolution, enabled by the GAFD Turbulence team on new computational
              codes and procedures, emphasize on different aspects of the physics
              approximated in a dynamical system as complex as the solar convection zone. 
              The Colorado team employs an anelastic spherical harmonic code, designed to
              deal with complex flows at high resolution in spherical shells.  The Minnesota
              team uses a fully compressible Piecewise-Parabolic Method code, where an entire
              rotating star with a convective envelope is placed in the middle of a very fin
              uniform Cartesian grid.  Both allow magnetic field effects to be included, as
              well, to prospectively study magnetic dynamo processes taking place deep in the
              convection zone, and effects visible near the stellar surface.
