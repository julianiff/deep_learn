Abstract    :
              This project involves the dual pursuit of core theoretical  investigations in
              computational geometry and experimentation with  geometric codes.  Theoretical
              investigations will address lower  bounds, geometric sampling techniques and
              derandomization.  Experimentation will involve the implementation of algorithms
              as  well as the development of tools to make future implementations  easier. 
              Special emphasis will be given to problems of  simplification and
              multiresolution of shapes in 3D, sampling and  optimization, algorithm
              animation and experimentation tools.
