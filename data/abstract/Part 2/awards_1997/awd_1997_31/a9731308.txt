Abstract    :
                The study of voters and elections has shed considerable light on people's vote
              choices and election outcomes.  Scholars have learned a lot about the
              distribution of preferences at particular points in time.  They also can often
              account for one election outcome being different from another.  Yet, little is
              known about the evolution of electoral sentiment over times, about how
              individuals' vote choices and election outcomes come into focus.  The current
              study is addressed at redressing this imbalance, focusing on a set of empirical
              questions:  at what point during the electoral cycle do voter choices harden,
              so that we can forecast from polls what the next election will bring?  Also, at
              what point can one read the election outcome from `fundamental` information? 
              What role does the election campaign actually play?  The researchers undertake
              a range of analyses, focusing on four different sets of data:  1) time series
              of presidential trial heats;  2) time series of generic congressional poll
              answers;  3)  state polls for presidential, gubernatorial, and U.S. Senatorial
              elections; and, 4) survey data.    The data set to be constructed will be of
              value to other scholars interested in the topic, and, this project promises to
              enhance our understanding of the question.
