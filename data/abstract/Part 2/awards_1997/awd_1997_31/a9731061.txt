Abstract    :
                  9731061  Bravaco      The project includes two years of workshops for
              teachers to help them make the transition from teaching a structured procedural
              language, Pascal, to one that includes Object Oriented Programming (OOP), C++. 
              The projects objectives are to help a core group of 25 teachers become
              competent in OOP and Design using C++; to create a peer group of computer
              science teachers who share ideas and draw on the expertise of their colleagues;
              to link local teachers to the college, to develop materials and resources for a
              national community interested in making a similar transition; and to initiate
              an annual regional conference of interested teachers.  Cost sharing is 18%.
