Abstract    :
                9731680  EDIE    This award established an Engineering Research Center (ERC)
              for Advanced Engineering Fibers and Films at Clemson University with
              Massachusetts Institute of  Technology as a partner institution.  The vision of
              the ERC is to provide an integrated environment for the system-oriented study
              of next generation fibers and films.  The research program emphasizes the use
              of computation/visualization tools to overcome the barriers of experimental
              development, structure/property relationships, and control of structures.  The
              research is organized under three thrust areas:  Computer-based Product and
              Process Development, New Fiber and Film Products, and Advanced Fiber and Film
              Processes.  The investigations will target liquid-crystalline systems,
              metallo-organic systems, and intractable polymer systems.  The new processes
              will include supercritical solution processing, in-situ processing, and
              self-assembly processing.  The ERC will produce software for new film and fiber
              formulation and processing design.  The ERC's interdisciplinary, systems
              oriented education program will provide the students with a holistic education
              in fiber and film science and technology.  The graduate education will include
              industrial residency for in-plant research experience.  The first year
              industrial partnership will include seventeen companies.    This award is the
              outcome of the Engineering Research Centers Competition under ERC Program
              Announcement, NSF 97-5.  The funds for the first five years is recommended with
              a potential duration of ten years under a cooperative agreement.
