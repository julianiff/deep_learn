Abstract    :
                            9731284  Lake     Working with existing projects such as the SSI,
              Mathematics Teacher/Resource Collaborating for Collaboration in the Classroom
              (MTRC3), and others, this project forms linkages across schools and districts
              throughout the region.  It engages teachers in teams, facilitated by mentors,
              to reflect on how their practice relates to state standards.  It helps develop
              teachers' assessment skills and, in the process, improves student outcomes and
              classroom practice.    Features are Web-based telementoring tools, Mentor
              Center, and an Exchange, all used to link K-12 educators, mathematicians and
              scientists.  In the first year teachers form teams from existing projects
              mentored by other teachers.  Central themes include constructing rubrics for
              assessing student work related to standards, understanding qualities of good
              student learning, and adopting effective instructional strategies.   In the
              second year this expands across grade levels and projects.   In the third year,
              new teachers are mentored by experienced teachers, and the project teams
              develop guides.    Cost sharing is 33%.
