Abstract    :
                  Woosley, Stanford  AST  97-31569    Dr. Woosley will continue his program of
              research into the origin and evolution of chemical elements, the evolution of
              massive stars, and the mechanisms and outcome of supernovae explosions. He will
              make a number of improvements to his stellar evolution model, including updated
              opacities and nuclear reaction rates, improved nuclear reaction networks, the
              incorporation of effects of mass loss and rotation, and a more thorough
              treatment of convection and mixing.  With these improved model results he will
              explore the sensitivities of the supernovae explosion properties to the
              pre-supernova model.  He also will study the physics of flame propagation and
              detonation in degenerate white dwarf stars to develop a better understanding of
              Type Ia supernovae.  In all cases, he will determine the detailed
              nucleosynthesis, with the continued goal of understanding the origin and
              evolution of the elements.  This suite of investigations has direct application
              to many related areas of research, such as galactic chemical evolution, the
              distance scale in the universe, gamma-ray astronomy, isotopic anomalies in
              meteorites, and particle astrophysics.   ***
