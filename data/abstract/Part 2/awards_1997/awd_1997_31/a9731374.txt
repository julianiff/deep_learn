Abstract    :
              9731374  Moore    This four year project is awarded $743,603  to provide
              enhancement activities for 160 chemistry teachers, 40 each year, in materials
              science.  The workshops will be three weeks long and will have additional
              follow-up. These workshops will begin in the summer of 1998, continuing through
              the summer of 2001.   The major content of the workshops will be the vast body
              of materials science and solid-state chemistry that can be used to illustrate
              typical high school chemistry topics.  The workshops will: 1) Introduce
              teachers to a large body of chemistry that was not included in their
              pare-service education;  2) Provide teachers with real world examples of
              state-of-the-art chemistry and hands-on materials that will stimulate students'
              interest in science and chemistry; 3)  Model up-to-date pedagogy and enable
              teachers to merge the new content and pedagogy into their chemistry curricula
              and classes;  4) Help teachers develop the leadership skills necessary to bring
              about positive changes; 5) Publish a materials science resource book that will
              be developed by the participant of the workshops and will be specifically
              geared to high school science teachers.  Participants will be selected on the
              basis of their potential for significant outreach, evidence of leadership
              qualities, connections to ICE Affiliates, district support, and potential for
              enhancing their current chemistry curriculum with new materials.  There will be
              continuous and on-going ICE  follow-up.     This project will provide matching
              funds from non-Federal sources totaling $178,652 which represents 24% of the
              award amount.
