Abstract    :
                  9731001  Cailliet    Declining fisheries and adverse impacts to benthic
              habitats  and biodiversity are a worldwide concern as coastal  resources around
              the world increasingly are being modified  by combined natural and human
              disturbances.  Scientists from  many Pacific nations and interested
              organizations have  organized a conference to discuss state-of-the-art research
               using geophysical and biological sampling tools to describe  benthic habitats
              as they relate to marine biodiversity and  fisheries issues in the Pacific to
              take place from November  10-16 in Noumea, New Caledonia.  A group of fifteen
              American  researchers, including ten senior investigators and five  graduate
              students will be able to attend the conference as a  result of the present
              award.   Attendance is expected to  include many representatives from small
              Pacific island  nations and territories such as the Cook Islands, Fiji,  Guam,
              Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, and Western Samoa, to  name a few, as well as
              from the larger Pacific Nations  including Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia,
              Malaysia, and  the United States.  France is also sending a sizable 
              contingent, and French institutions are centrally involved  in the planning,
              including the Institut Francais de  Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer
              (IFREMER) and the  Institut Francais de Recherche Scientifique pour le 
              Developpment en Cooperation (OSTROM).  Drs. Jean-Marie  Auzende and Rene
              Grandperrin of IFREMER and OSTROM  respectively are helping to plan the
              meeting.  This  conference is expected to create greater opportunities for 
              American scientists to pursue research and education in  marine benthic
              habitats and biodiversity and to provide  Pacific island scientists and
              officials with scientific  information useful in managing their marine
              habitats.
