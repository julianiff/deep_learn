Abstract    :
              9731015  Winter    This REU Site enables undergraduate students between their 
              junior and senior years to participate in  biochemistry/molecular biology
              research. Students are  recruited nationwide with a good representation of
              diverse  geographical areas and minority students.  They are assigned  to
              mentors who are active in research and are extramurally  funded.  Students also
              participate in a series of classroom  activities, including research talks by
              faculty and graduate  students and discussions of career choices, of ethical 
              issues in science and research, and of recent advances in  the biological
              sciences.  The overall goal is to foster an  understanding and appreciation of
              what biochemists and  molecular biologists do.
