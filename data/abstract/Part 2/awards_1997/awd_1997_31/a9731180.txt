Abstract    :
              AST-9731180                                                               
              Abstract                                    A near-infrared multi-object
              spectrometer (The FLoridA Multi-  object INfrared Grism Observational
              Spectrometer or FLAMINGOS)  covering the spectral range from 0.9 micrometers to
              2.5  micrometers is to be constructed.  The instrument will be fully  cryogenic
              allowing background limited operation through the  entire H and K bands.  The
              instrument is a combination of a wide-  field near-IR imager and multi-object
              spectrometer which will  accept any input beam slower than f/6.  It will have a
              Lyot stop  wheel carrying a number of stops.
