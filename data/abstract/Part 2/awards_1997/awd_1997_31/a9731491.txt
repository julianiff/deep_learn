Dr. Cowley will carry out an observational study of
              supersoft X-ray binary systems to measure more accurately their stellar masses
              and other fundamental physical parameters.  Both spectroscopic and photometric
              observations will be made which will provide information on stellar properties
              such as temperature, luminosity, and mass, as well as the mass ratio, orbital
              inclination, and mass transfer rate and structure of the accretion disk. 
              Observations will be compared to existing models to elucidate the nature of the
              compact objects in these systems and distinguish between competing models of
              white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole accretors.
