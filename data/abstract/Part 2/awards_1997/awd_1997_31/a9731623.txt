Abstract    :
                  Lou, Yu-Qing  AST-9731623      Drs. Lou and Rosner will investigate
              magneto-hydrodynamic wave processes in magnetized, late-type stellar
              atmospheres and winds, combining analytical and numerical techniques to several
              specific problems.  Their work has application to various nonlinear dynamic
              processes in magnetized stellar atmospheres and the basic problem of mass
              losses through the process of stellar wind acceleration.  Their theoretical
              investigations have bearing on the larger issues of stellar and solar activity
              and atmospheric heating, massive wind outflows, and stellar oscillations.
