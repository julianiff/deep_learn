Abstract    :
              ***  9731605  Fletcher  The Department of Physics, Florida State University will
               continue an REU Site.  The principal objective is to serve  the southeast
              region of the United States as a center for  summer undergraduate research
              participation in physics.  Grants of "Summer Junior Fellowships" will be made
              to  applicants interested in investigating physics research as a  career. 
              Special consideration will be given to applications  from women and minorities,
              and from the many small schools  in the region which have either no graduate
              programs or  limited research facilities.  The program will afford  research
              experience in many areas of physics with the  experimental nuclear physics
              research group serving as the  host with principal responsibility for the
              program.  The available areas of experimental research include nuclear 
              physics, particle physics, solid state physics including  materials research,
              high Tc superconductors, surface and  polymer crystal physics, high field
              magnetism, and  theoretical computational physics.  Summer Junior Fellows  will
              be placed in established research programs according to  their interest, as
              expressed in their application, and their  acceptance by the research group
              participating in the REU-  Site program.  ***
