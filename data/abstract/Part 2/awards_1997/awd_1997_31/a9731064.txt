Abstract    :
              9731064  Shifter      ABSTRACT:  This project entitled, Teaching to the Big
              Ideas of Geometry, Measurement and Data Analysis involves the creation of
              professional development materials which are designed to help teachers of K-8
              mathematics understand the mathematics they teach, understand how children
              learn this material, and ultimately, improve their mathematics teaching.  The
              project is directed by Deborah Schifter of the Education Development Center
              (EDC), with Co-PI's Susan Jo Russell of TERC, and Virginia Bastable of Mt.
              Holyoke College.  This is a 4.5 year project, which will involve between
              540-640 teachers.       This project builds off of a prior funded project that
              dealt with Teaching to the Big Ideas involving number.  Within each project
              module proposed in this project, the writers plan to integrate a variety of
              activities centered around print and video cases.  This will include
              mathematics examples, investigation of the thinking of students, an analysis of
              tasks drawn from NSF-funded elementary curriculum projects (Investigations,
              Trailblazers, and Everyday Math), and the reading and review of research
              related to a theme central to the module.  The PI's believe strongly that
              teachers can improve aspects of their teaching practice through engaging
              discussions with their peers.  Cases situated in a classroom context help to
              provide the access to the issues driving such discussions.     All of the
              NSF-funded elementary curriculum projects will be used in this project as the
              source of mathematics tasks.
