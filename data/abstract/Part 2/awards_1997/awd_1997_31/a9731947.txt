Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of synthetic techniques for   the
              preparation of alpha-amino acids.  The main classes of methodology to   be
              explored include: 1) allyl and crotyl silane/stannane additions to  
              oxazinal-based oxonium ions to access hydroxymethylene peptide isostere;   2)
              an asymmetric (1,3) dipolar cycloaddition approach to   spirotryprostatin; 3)
              unsymmetrically beta, beta-disubstituted   alpha-amino acids via inter- and
              intramolecular SN2' reactions and via   radical additions to E- and Z-alpha,
              beta-dehydro oxazinones; 4)   preparation of Z-beta,
              gamma-unsaturated-alpha-amino acids and   Z-1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic
              acids. With this renewal award, the   Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program is supporting the research   of Dr. Robert M. Williams of the
              Department of Chemistry at Colorado   State University.  Professor Williams
              will focus his work on developing   efficient, selective and practical
              methodology for the construction of   biologically important alpha-amino acids
              and their derivatives in   optically pure form.
