Abstract    :
              Meech    9731083    This project, sponsored by the University of Hawaii, will
              carry out a five-year project teaching astronomy concepts to 150 high school
              teachers, 30 each year with some repeaters. The intent of the program is to
              enable the teachers to teach their students astronomy while at the same time
              doing actual astronomy observations. Thus the teachers will learn the astronomy
              concepts by actually doing the observations themselves thereby also becoming
              involved in astronomy research. Cultural astronomy will also be a part of the
              content. This is of special interest to teachers from the nine Pacific Rim
              territories where cultural astronomy is an important local issue. The teachers
              selected will participate in two pre-workshop seminars, a five-day summer
              workshop working with professional astronomers to gain content knowledge and
              acquire insight into research and a 13 day program working with students in
              astronomical observations and development of the appropriate pedagogy for
              hands-on activities. During the next, and following, academic years the program
              will be supported by internet activities, seminars and classroom workshops.
