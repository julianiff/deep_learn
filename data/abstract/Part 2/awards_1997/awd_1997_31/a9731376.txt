Abstract    :
              9731376  ASKEW  This project will support shipboard scientific support equipment
               for the research vessels SEWARD JOHNSON and EDWIN LINK operated by the Harbor
              Branch Oceanographic Institution and dedicated to use in support of ocean
              science research.      The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program
              provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe
              conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such 
              items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and
              retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars,
              gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin  point the location of research
              sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite
              transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment
              such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data
              retrieval sites.    The Project Director, Tim Askew, is fully qualified to
              direct this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the
              acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.      This project will
              allow the institution to build a storage rack for the SEWARD JOHNSON's lift
              pendant, acquire an INMARSAT B for the SEWARD JOHNSON, an INMARSAT C for the
              EDWIN LINK, a wire tensioner and four outboard motors.  ***
