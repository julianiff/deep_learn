Abstract    :
              ***  9731869  Jaecks  This research focuses on the study of the partitioning of 
              excess energy and/or angular momentum in coulombic many-body  quantum systems. 
              Two projects will be undertaken.  In one  the dissociation of H3+ will be
              studied through a triple  coincidence measurement of the laboratory energies
              and  angles for the three emerging particles.  In the second the  energy and
              angular momentum sharing and redistribution among  electrons in argon will be
              measured when the atom absorbs a  linearly or circularly polarized photon
              resulting in the  removal of one electron and the excitation of another.
