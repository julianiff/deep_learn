Abstract    :
                    9731233  Gaines    The University of Miami provides a 36-month Teacher and
              Student Development Through Research Experience project.  The project engages
              27 seventh grade students and 9 teachers each summer in ecological research
              focused on the Florida environment.  Teams of 6 participants each work with a
              faculty researcher and an undergraduate facilitator on an on-going project
              during the 6-week summer experience.  Follow-on occurs as teachers transfer the
              research experience into their classrooms, data collection continues at the
              summer field sites, schoolyard environmental research projects are developed,
              and students and teachers engage in a WWW-based research community.
