Abstract    :
              The proposed work will test the ideas about how oceanic lithosphere deforms as
              it enters the subduction zone and how its composition affects the magmatism of
              the adjacent volcanic arc.  The investigators will undertake a magnetic and
              multibeam bathymetric survey and dredge rock samples from the outer bulge of
              Tonga-Kermadec Trench for geomorphological and geochemical analyses,
              respectively.  This will allow them to sample young exposures of old oceanic
              crust rpoduced by faulting and study the sample young exposures of old oceanic
              crust produced by faulting and study the Mesozoic deformation.  A 2000-km long
              and 80 km wide strip will be mapped by Seabeam 2000 and ca 20-30 dredge samples
              will be collected.
