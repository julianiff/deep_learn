Abstract    :
              9731244  Goldenberg    The Education Developoment Center (EDC) is developing,
              field-testing, and disseminating professional development materials for
              mathematics teachers in grades 6-12.  These materials highlight connections
              between important mathematics, effective teaching practices, and the
              implementation of innovative instructional materials for students.  Designed to
              be used in Local Systemic Change in Mathematics projects, the materials are
              also suitable for use in university courses for preservice and inservice
              teachers, summer institutes, curriculum implementation centers, Statewide
              Systemic Initiative (SSI) workshops, and school-based professional development
              programs.  The materials emphasize and integrate mathematical thinking,
              effective teaching practice, and explicit connections to exemplary curriculum
              materials (all the NSF-supported, comprehensive middle and high school
              instructional materials and others), providing teachers with immersion
              experiences in three areas of mathematics: algebra, geometry, and
              probability/statistics.
