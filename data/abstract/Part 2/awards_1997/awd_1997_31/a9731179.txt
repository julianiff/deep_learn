Abstract    :
              AST-9731179  Reed    Photometry, Database Development, and  Analyses of Galactic
              Plane OB Stars    Stars of spectral types 0 and B are among the hottest, most
              luminous, and short lived stars known, and, as such, cannot move far from their
              birthplaces in the spiral arms of disk galaxies during their main-sequence
              lifetimes of but a few millions of years.   Consequently, they serve as natural
              "tracers" of the physical, chemical, and dynamical structures of such galaxies
              and as laboratories for studying the natures of massive stars and star-forming
              regions.  These stars within our own Milky Way (MW) Galaxy are of particular
              interest as their apparent brightness make them relatively easy to study in
              detail.    Over 12,000 OB stars in the plane of the Milky Way were cataloged by
              astronomers at the Hamburg and Warner and Swasey observatories in a seven
              volume set of luminous stars (LS) catalogs between 1959 and 1971.  These LS
              catalogs constitute the most extensive available uniformly-executed survey for
              intrinsically luminous stars in the plane of the MW, and have served as
              starting points for a number of research projects for more than three decades. 
                A project has begun to compile published spectrophotometric information for
              the LS stars into a coherent database that would be made freely available to
              the astronomical community.   The resulting set of databases have stimulated a
              number of investigations and the database continues to grow and be disseminated
              as new data are published.    Despite their importance in a variety of areas of
              astronomical research, fundamental broadband photometry (let alone spectroscopy
              or narrow-band photometry) has yet to be obtained for nearly half of the LS
              stars.  This project is therefore directed at (I) obtaining photometry for as
              many of these stars as possible while (II) expanding the existing databases to
              incorporate published spectral classifications for LS stars visible from the
              Northern hemisphere, and (III) undertaking the analyses of the accumulated
              data.   The resulting databases will be made freely available to the entire
              astronomical community.  Alma College has guaranteed access to telescope time
              to carry out the project.     Undergraduate students will be involved in all
              aspects of this work.  The students will have the opportunity to apply
              knowledge and techniques acquired in the classroom to actual research
              situations.  ***
