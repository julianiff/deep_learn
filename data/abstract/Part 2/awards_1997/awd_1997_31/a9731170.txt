Abstract    :
              Investigators perform a theoretical study of nonlinear electrodynamic coupling
              effects of tropospheric thunderstorms to the mesospheric and lower ionospheric
              regions in (1) intense electromagnetic pulses (EMP), originating in lightning
              discharges, and (2) long-enduring electrostatic (ES) fields, produced by
              electrified thunderclouds.  Such coupling produces strong modification of
              conductivity in the mesosphere/lower ionosphere above thunderstorms.  Using two
              and three dimensional electromagnetic models of the lower ionosphere's
              interaction of lightning EMPs and ES thundercloud fields, radiative transfer
              models, and D-region chemistry models, they are gaining (1) quantitative
              information on the spatial extent and temporal dynamics of the mesosphere and
              lower ionosphere, modified by heating in lightning EMPs and ES thundercloud
              fields; (2) identification of the dominant sinks in the mesosphere and lower
              ionosphere for the electromagnetic energy generated by thunderstorms; and (3)
              quantitative assessment of long-term effects of the EMPs and thundercloud ES
              fields on the chemical and thermal balance in the mesosphere and ionosphere.
