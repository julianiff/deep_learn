              -------------------------------  9731482    This proposal funds scientific
              instrumentation required aboard the R/V   MOANA WAVE, a 280' research vessel
              operated by the University and   owned by the Navy. In 1998, the National
              Science Foundation will   support 198 days of research on the ship. The
              research will be   conducted primarily in the Northeast and Central Pacific. 
              The   instrumentation requested includes an undulating towed vehicle, a   winch
              for mooring operations, refurbishment of a fast seismic   streamer, coring
              equippment, and a dual lowered Acoustic Doppler   Current Profiler (ADCP). 
              This instrumentation is necessary to support   the scientific programs assigned
              to the ship.
