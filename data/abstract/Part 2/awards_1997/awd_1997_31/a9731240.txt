Abstract    :
              Anthropologists have shown that the expansion of markets into traditional
              societies lowers human welfare and hurts the environment, but natural resource
              economists have said that economic development improves conservation once
              people move beyond a threshold of income.  This proposal tests hypotheses about
              market involvement and deforestation: that the amount of annual labor income or
              number of days spent working in non-farm jobs by a household will be negatively
              related to the clearance of old-growth forest, and that the share of the
              harvest sold or income from the sales will be positively related to the
              clearance of old-growth forest, and that integration through markets and cash
              income from the sale of crops and labor will bear a non-linear relation to
              forest clearance, rising at first but then declining once households passed a
              threshold of income.  The hypotheses will be tested with data from the Chimane
              Amerindians in lowland Bolivia, elicited by an anthropologist, a conservation
              biologist, and three doctoral students of anthropology.   This research will
              help advance our understanding of the relation between market involvement and
              conservation in Indigenous society, and will advance science in cultural
              anthropology by training students in field methods and multivariate data
              analysis.  It will also improve our society's expertise about this important
              region of the world.
