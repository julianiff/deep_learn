Abstract:
              Wainger plans to study maximal and singular averages of functions defined on
              n-dimensional space, where n is greater than or equal to 2. In contrast to the
              theory of Calderon and Zygmund, the integration in these averages is to take
              place over curves or surfaces of positive codimension. Wainger is interested in
              L-p bounds for these operators that relate to curvature properties of the
              curves and surfaces. He also plans to study discrete analogues of these
              questions, in which integration is replaced by a summation over a discrete set
              of points.

An important problem in mathematics in the last 250 years has
              been that of approximating arbitrary functions by combinations of simpler
              functions. This problem arose in the study of vibrating strings in the 18th
              century and in the study of heat flow in the 19th century. More recently this
              problem has been the focus of considerable activity in conjunction with the
              electronic transmission of data. This approximation problem has led in modern
              times to the problem of finding estimates for the sizes of certain "averages"
              of functions in terms of the size of the functions. Wainger's proposed research
              involves the averaging of functions of n variables, with n greater than or
              equal to 2, now over surfaces or curves in n-dimensional space rather than all
              of n-dimensional space. He then seeks estimates for these averages in terms of
              geometric properties of the surfaces or curves, as well as of the functions
              themselves.
