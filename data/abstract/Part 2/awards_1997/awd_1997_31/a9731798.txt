Abstract    :
              The 1998 IEEE Information Theory Workshop is sponsored by the Information Theory
              Society of the IEEE will be held in San Diego, CA  on February 8-11, 1998. The
              primary objective of the Workshop is to present new perspectives and results in
              a broad range of research areas in information and its applications.  There
              will be six technical sessions, held serially covering the following topics: 1)
              Information Theory: 50 Years and Beyond, 2) Universal and Lossless Source
              Coding, 3) Channel Coding Applications, 4) CDMA, 5) Channel Coding Theory, and
              6) Lossy Source Coding.    Each session will include six invited speakers, each
              internationally recognized for contributions in the respective research areas. 
              In addition, there will be a plenary lecture each morning, as well as a special
              evening lecture.  There is also a session for contributed recent research
              results.     The purpose of the award is to provide financial support from NSF
              for travel grants to U.S> scientists and engineers who could not otherwise
              attend the Workshop for lack of funding.
