Abstract    :
              97-31282  Jones    This project builds on earlier work funded by NSF to document
              evidence of student learning in primary science.  Documentation enhances
              teachers' observations and understanding of young children's learning,
              evaluates instruction and assesses children's progress.  This project addresses
              the following research questions:    * How does the process of documentation
              broaden educators' awareness of the range of assessment options?  * How does
              the process of documentation enhance teachers' understanding of young
              children's learning?  How does it heighten teachers' understanding of the
              science in children's talk and work samples?  * How does the process of
              documentation enhance teachers' reflection on their instructional practice?  *
              What are effective classroom-based strategies to document young children's
              science understandings?    Specifically, the project will develop multimedia
              documentation materials, create professional development study groups, and
              conduct working conferences for participants to explore ways in which
              documentation broadens educators' range of assessment options.
