Abstract    :
              The  field of service robotics holds the potential to increase the  quality  of 
              life  of millions by removing people from  situations  that  are dirty, dull,
              and dangerous. However, current robots  are  far  too  expensive, have limited
              task flexibility, and  lack  the  robustness  required for use in service
              applications.  A  paradigm  shift  is  required if service robots are to ever
              be as ubiquitous  as  personal computers. The goal of this research is to
              develop  a  "toolbox"  containing  simple actuators  and  structural  elements 
              together  with  a  design  methodology  which  governs   how   the  components 
              should be assembled for specified service  tasks.  The  cornerstone  of  this 
              approach is the use of  binary  (two-state)  actuators  such  as  pneumatic
              cylinders  because  of  their  high  payload  to  weight  ratio  and  very  low
               cost.  When  used   in  combination   with  passive  damping  elements  
              (dashpots)   such  actuators  provide smooth and well-behaved motion  between 
              binary  states with very little backlash.  Within a specified set of tasks  the
              robot constructed from this toolbox is essentially a dedicated  machine. The
              dedicated nature of the resulting machine reduces the  cost  requirements and
              increases the reliability of the  robot  as  compared to general purpose
              robots.
