Abstract    :
              ***  9731882  Cassel  The Laboratory of Nuclear Studies at Cornell University
              will  initiate an NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates Site.  This
              project will provide undergraduate students with the  excitement and challenge
              of frontline research in elementary  particle physics and accelerator physics. 
              The NSF-supported Laboratory has an international reputation  for research and
              graduate education and a unique  constellation of research programs including
              experimental  and theoretical elementary particle physics, accelerator 
              physics, microwave superconductivity, instrumentation for  scientific research,
              and high performance computing.  The  REU Site program builds on the
              Laboratory's long tradition  of successfully involving undergraduate students
              in research  and extends research opportunities to much wider group of 
              students.  The REU program emphasizes providing research  experience for women,
              minority students, and students from  institutions with limited research
              programs.  Although this  research is focused on understanding fundamental
              physics,  the techniques and technologies utilized are applicable in a  much
              wider range of scientific research.  ***
