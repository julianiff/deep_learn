Abstract    :
              9731005  Vogt    Hormones control many changes in the nervous systems of humans
              and other animals throughout life, yet relatively little is know regarding the
              actual mechanisms by which hormones regulate nervous system development.  Dr.
              Vogt will examine how steroid hormones control the birth of sensory nerve cells
              during the sexual maturation phase of adult development, using an insect
              olfactory system as a model.  The study system is well characterized, is
              accessible to experimental analysis and manipulation, and has close parallels
              with other animal models.  A great deal is known about the genetics of sensory
              nerve cell formation, but as yet little is known about the mechanisms of
              hormone action on nerve cell formation. Dr. Vogt has previously shown that
              steroid hormones present during development can control the timing and patterns
              of nerve cell birth, as well as the expression of genes which themselves
              control sensory neuron development.  He will now identify specific mechanisms
              by which steroid hormones control the birth of new nerve cells.  The results
              from this project will enrich our understanding of basic cell biological
              processes at work in sensory development.  Further, because of the use of an
              insect model, the project will provide insight for the design of new strategies
              for insect control in olfactory-based predation of crop plants and
              olfactory-based host seeking and mate seeking behaviors.
