Abstract    :
              9731301  Willis  This award to Oregon State University will provide
              instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/V Wecoma, a research
              vessel operated by Oregon State University as part of the University National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific instruments to be
              acquired include an oxygen sensor, a compact disk recording system and upgrades
              to the shipboard analog-digital network.  The shared-use instrumentation
              supported here will assist marine scientists conduct studies, particularly in 
              the Northeast Pacific Ocean, in 1997 and in future years.  ***
