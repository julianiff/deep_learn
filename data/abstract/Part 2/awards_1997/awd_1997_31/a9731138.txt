              Abstract  ATM-9731138  Asmerom, Yemane  University of New Mexico  Title: SGER:
              Chronology of Submerged Speleothems form the Blue Hole         Belize:
              Implications for Sea Level and Tropical Climate             Change Through Time
                 The SGER award supports a pilot study on the analysis of extant  speleothem
              (carbonate cave deposits) samples recovered from the  "Blue Hole," Lighthouse
              Reef, Belize.  The study's objective is to  obtain a high resolution U-series
              chronology and stable isotope  record in order to reconstruct an accurate
              chronology of sea level  change and possible isotopic proxy record of tropical
              paleoclimate.   The work will be based on U-series analysis by thermal
              ionization  mass spectrometry (TIMS).  These rare samples provide an 
              opportunity for the demonstration of the TIMS methodology may  greatly improve
              our ability to reconstruct fine-scale chronometric  series in carbonate
              sections.
