Abstract    :
              9731118  Zobel  Description:  This award is for the US-Nepal Collaborative
              Research: The  Role of Water Relations in Controlling the Leaf Life Cycle of
              Himalayan  Trees.  The investigators, Donald Zobel of Oregon State University, 
              Corvallis, OR and Pramod K. Jha of Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu,  Nepal will
              address fundamental questions in plant biology concerning  Himalayan tree
              species.  The primary goals are-- 1) to determine the role  of water relations
              in governing leaf development and leaf senescence of  trees in the central
              Himalaya, and 2) examine possible mechanisms by  which Himalayan trees generate
              sufficient turgor to expand leaves during  the dry season.    Scope:  This
              project will be a major boost for water relations research in  Nepal.  In
              addition to training of young Nepalese scientists and providing  essential
              equipment to conduct botany research at Tribhuvan University,  this project
              will develop an important regional link with botanists at  Kumaun University,
              India who have collaborated with the US PI on the  same topic.  While both
              Indian and Nepalese groups have made substantial  contributions to Himalayan
              ecology, there has been little coordination of  effort and expertise.  For US
              science, this project will produce a large  volume of currently unavailable
              data on water relations, vegetation, and  ecosystem processes in Himalayan
              forests and will improve analysis and  prediction at the scale of the
              biosphere.     ***
