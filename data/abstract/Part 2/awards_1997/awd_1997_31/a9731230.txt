This work consists of a coordinated experimental and
              theoretical investigation of the shaping of microscopic and macroscopic noise
              in spontaneously initiated Stokes Raman Scattering in optical fibers.  A major
              focus of the investigation will be the interplay of quantum initiation noise
              and amplified pump noise that arises in higher-order Stokes generation.  A
              strong coupling between the experimental and theoretical work will provide
              insight into how macroscopic and microscopic noise sources act together to
              determine the statistical properties of the output of a nonlinear optical
              system.
