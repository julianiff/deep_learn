Abstract    :
                    9731242  Nelson     The Administrators Working for Change Project is a
              professional development project in the area of K-8 mathematics.  The Education
              Development Center (EDC) working in collaboration with Wheelock College, Lesley
              College, the Boston Public Schools, and the Educational Collaborative for
              Greater Boston and national field test sites, will develop, pilot, field test,
              publish, and disseminate instructional materials and facilitator's guides to
              support school and district administrators' learning about issues in
              mathematics education reform.       The project seeks to involve 520 K-8
              administrators and will create two 42-hour graduate courses entitled:
              Administrative Issues in Implementing New Mathematics Curricula and Teacher
              Supervision in Elementary Mathematics.  The project has plans to link with the
              National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), the National Council of
              Supervisors of Mathematics (NCSM) and the Association for Supervision and
              Curriculum Development (ASCD).  The courses are designed for university-based
              principal certification programs or as advanced courses for practicing
              administrators.  Course modules are for use by school districts or regional
              service providers.  A unique feature of this project is its focus on providing
              school and district administrators with the knowledge and tools to support
              teachers implementing reform-based mathematics initiatives and in helping
              communities to understand and support mathematics education reform.
