Abstract    :
              9731136  Kelemen  This award will support the participation of United States 
              scientists in a cooperative project with Japanese colleagues to use  a research
              submersible to study the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The  scientific objectives of the
              project are to examine an area of the  ridge where mantle rocks are located at
              the seafloor. Either the  formation of normal ocean crust is significantly
              reduced in this  area, or faulting has exposed lower crust and upper mantle.
              The  U.S. scientists will specifically be focusing on geochemical  studies of
              the recovered samples to understand their formation  history. Data from this
              project will also be used to identify sites  for future crustal drilling.  ***
