Abstract    :
                Thorne, Kip  AST  97-31698    Dr. Thorne will carry out a program of
              theoretical research addressing issues in the generation of gravitational waves
              by astrophysical objects and in relativistic astrophysics.  The gravitational
              wave research, which makes up the majority of the research program, will focus
              on waves detectable by LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
              Observatory).  Thorne and his research group will identify what wave-generation
              computations are needed for LIGO and will carry out some of these computations,
              and give advice on others to other researchers.  Thorne's work is particularly
              concerned with waves produced by the inspiral and merger of binary systems made
              of black holes, neutron stars, and hypothetical compact objects, such as boson
              stars, soliton stars, and naked singularities.  The calculations will produce
              detailed, high-accuracy waveforms, computed by solving the Einstein field
              equations for the binaries' inspiral, merger, and ringdown, which will provide
              guidance for the search and extraction of information from LIGO data.    ***
