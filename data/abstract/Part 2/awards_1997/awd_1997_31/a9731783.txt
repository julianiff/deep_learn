Abstract    :
              9731783  Potts, Joseph  Cukor, Peter  GTE Laboratories Inc.    REU:  Computer
              and Telecommunications Research for Undergraduates    This Research Experiences
              for Undergraduates (REU) Site project provides partial support for fifteen
              students per year in programs carried out during the summers, for three years. 
              Students are selected from a nation-wide applicant pool and work with a member
              of the GTE Laboratories technical staff on a project in the area of computer,
              information and telecommunications networks.  The student projects are aimed at
              solving real life industrial problems and thus provide most program
              participants with a new type of experience.  Requirements include both oral and
              written reports.  University faculty members play an important role in the
              selection of participants and in administration of the program.  Strong efforts
              are made to recruit women and minority students.
