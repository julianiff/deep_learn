Abstract    :
              9731383  Green    This grant provides partial salary support for a technician at
               the UC-Riverside Tectonophysics laboratory. This is a Phase II  grant for
              technical support under the EAR/IF program.  The  technician is essentially a
              machinist who provides the necessary  high precision fabrication of parts for
              continued development of  Dr. Green's modified multianvil device used in
              studies of the  deformation mechanics of deep mantle phases.  This innovative
              and  unique high pressure multianvil device introduces shear stresses  on
              samples contained in a NaCl confining media, thereby reducing  piston
              frictional effects and resultant spatial temperature  variations within the
              sample volume.   Experimental results using  this device with germanate and
              titanate analogues of deep mantle  silicates has resulted in Green's hypothesis
              that deep-focus  earthquakes within subduction zones are the result of a phase 
              change from olivine to a spinel polymorph.  Work in the arena of  high-pressure
              phase change initiation of faulting continues with  synthetic silicates and
              improvements in the engineering design of  Green's modified multianvil device. 
              These experiments hold  considerable promise for our understanding of deep
              earthquake  mechanics.  ***
