Abstract    :
                This is a proposal for a CMBS sponsored research conference on  division
              algebras. The week long conference will be held at   Colorado State University
              in Fort Collins Colorado in the  summer of 1998. The principal speaker, David
              Saltman, is an  authority on the subject.  He is both one of the main 
              contributors to recent advances in the subject and a popularizer  of the area
              through his students, collaborators  and lectures.  The subject itself is
              concrete and can be  approached in an elementary way.  Division algebras are
              currently  an exciting area of research, with both knowledge of these  objects
              and the application of this knowledge expanding rapidly.   This makes the
              proposed subject an ideal one for a research  conference appealing to a broad
              audience. For more information  contact Frank DeMeyer, Department of
              Mathematics, Colorado State  University (e-mail demeyer@math.colostate.edu)
