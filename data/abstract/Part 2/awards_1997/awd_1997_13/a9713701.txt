Abstract    :
              This research project deals with the development of an integrated  methodology
              for modeling, design and control of electromagnetic  systems. An approach to
              developing this integrated methodology  consist of two basic components:
              Development of a modeling and  design strategy for the electromagnet actuation
              scheme using  Permanent-ElectroMagnet (PEM) combinations that support the large
               travel and the high stiffness performance requirements, and the  formulation
              of a discrete time, robust nonlinear control  architecture that guarantees
              ultra precision tracking performance  under external disturbances and plant
              variations. This tight  coupling between the design of the electromagnetic
              actuation  scheme and that of the control architecture ensures that the  entire
              system responds at the stringent performance levels  demanded of it. Results
              from this project provide a clear  methodology for designing electromagnetic
              actuation schemes given  a set of performance requirements; improve the
              understanding of  nonlinear, discrete time control in the context of high 
              performance electromechanical systems; and enable technology that  is essential
              for the development of magnetic suspension  actuators. By adding PEM
              combination, the research project  enhances the capabilities of the large
              travel Magnetic Suspension  Actuator currently under development at the
              Coordinate Metrology  and Measurement Laboratory at Ohio State University. It
              leads to  a system that addresses the high performance actuation  requirements
              of the precision engineering industry for a range of  applications such as
              photolithography, semiconductor wafer  inspection, free-form precision
              machining and non-circular  turning.
