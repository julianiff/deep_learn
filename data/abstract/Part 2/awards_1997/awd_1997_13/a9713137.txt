              ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:        ECS-9713137    Principal Investigator: Uwe
              Kortshagen    Title:                  Advanced kinetic methods for efficient
              modeling of low pressure discharges    In this research, mathematical methods
              to describe the electron kinetics in the intermediate regime between low
              neutral densities and high neutral densities will be developed.  The low
              pressure discharges used for plasma processing fall into the intermediate
              regime and there are currently no existing models which are accurate for this
              regime.  The methods developed will be rigorously checked against Monte Carlo
              simulations, and against experiments.
