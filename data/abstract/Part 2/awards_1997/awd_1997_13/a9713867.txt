Abstract    :
                This project is providing travel support to selected United States
              mathematicians to attend a meeting to be held in Pretoria, South Africa which
              is jointly sponsored by the American Mathematical Society (AMS), the London
              Mathematical Society (LMS), and the South African Mathematical Society (SAMS). 
              The conference blends mathematics education and research topics.  Because the
              meeting is one of the most important mathematics occasions in South Africa, the
              AMS, through its sponsorship of the meeting, is encouraging broad
              participation, especially by African-American mathematicians.    *
