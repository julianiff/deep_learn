Abstract    :
              The basic understanding of energetic particle acceleration and modulation is
              likely to be an integral component of future space weather forecasting.  This
              investigation addresses:  (1) the acceleration of particles at coronal mass
              ejection (CME)-driven shocks, (2) the interaction of galactic cosmic rays with
              the CME complex, and (3) the transport of energetic particles to one
              astronomical unit.  The PI will develop theoretical models describing the
              diffusive acceleration of energetic particles at fast CME associated shocks and
              their subsequent propagation through the interplanetary medium to Earth.  Based
              on a multi-dimensional study, he will also determine a detailed understanding
              of the time profiles and flux intensities of large proton events for a variety
              of interplanetary magnetic field configurations.  Project goals, then, will
              deploy a unique blend of modeling, analysis and MHD simulations.
