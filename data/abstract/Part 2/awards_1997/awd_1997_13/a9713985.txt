Abstract    :
              9713985  Yang   This award is aimed to develop an iso-phote based methodology
              for tool path generation.  Based on this methodology, interference-free tool
              path generation algorithms will be developed utilizing part geometric features.
               These algorithms will be evaluated and experimentally tested in the generation
              of tool paths for 3axis machining of composite surfaces and 5-axis flank
              machining of free-form surfaces.  Comparisons will be made with existing
              tool-path generation algorithms including those based on iso-parametric
              machining, iso-planner machining, and constant scallop-height machining.   The
              iso-phote based tool-path generation methodology is a new approach that is
              worth exploring.  It could potentially offer significant advantages over other
              approaches used by the existing CAD/CAM systems for machining of complex parts
              with free-form and composite surfaces.
