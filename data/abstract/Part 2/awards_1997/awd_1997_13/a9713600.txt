Abstract    :
              Earth's ionosphere, the final link in the solar-terrestrial connection, is
              fundamental to understanding conditions where solar perturbations result in
              damage to technological systems, such as power distribution systems, navigation
              aids, and communication networks.  The investigators, recognizing this need,
              are creating a novel event-driven protocol adapting the Sondrestrom radar
              operational mode, data analysis, and data dissemination to the specific needs
              of space weather modeling and specification teams.  Specifically, the
              Sondrestrom Radar Response System (SRRS) will enable operation during periods
              subsequent to detection of a coronal mass ejection, from beginning to end. 
              Coronal mass ejections can be detected early with upstream monitors such as
              SOHO and WIND satellites, and their probability for terrestrial impact can then
              be better calculated.  The design and implementation of the SRRS will greatly
              accelerate the development of near-real time electrodynamic specification tools
              for eventual integration into space weather forecasting models.
