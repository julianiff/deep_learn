Abstract    :
                The proposed research is the first laboratory study of the  electron-ion
              hybrid instability driven by a shear in the cross-  field ion drift.  The
              objectives are to (1) excite the EIH mode in  the two parameter regimes
              assoicated with their laoratory device,  (2) determine the dependence of the
              frequency and wave vector  spectra on shear parameters, (3) characterize the
              ion heating  induced by EIH waves and its saturation mechanism, and (4) to 
              determine the influence of introducing a second ion species,  positively and
              negatively charges, on items 2 and 3.  These  experiments are relevant to the
              interpretation of the dynamically  intense geomagnetic activity that arises at
              the edges of auoral  arcs and in black aurora.
