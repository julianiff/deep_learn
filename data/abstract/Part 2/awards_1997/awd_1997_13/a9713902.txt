Abstract    :
              This research project seeks to develop a novel reference-free part encapsulation
              fixturing technology by extending and further developing the existing
              phase-change based fixturing technologies.  Several key research issues are
              addressed for successful development and implementation of this new fixturing
              technology.  First, analyses and experiments will be performed for a better
              understanding of the mechanical and metallurgical behavior of the filler block
              which fixes the part.  Second, technologies for dispensing the filler material,
              controlling temperatures in casting and handling the filler block will be
              developed.  Third, the developed technologies will be assembled for automating
              the machining of general three-dimensional components that require multiple
              setups.    The reference-free part encapsulation technology presents some
              novelty.  There exist many fundamental research issues which need to be
              addressed before this technology can be successfully adopted by industry.  This
              investigation will address these fundamental issues in the development of this
              technology.
