Abstract    :
              9713205  Johnson    Colloidal materials are thought to mediate the partitioning,
              transport, and bioavailability of contaminants.   However, field data on
              colloid-mediated contaminant behavior is highly limited due to the inability to
              separate colloids from environmental waters without significant loss of
              associated contaminants to the separation apparatus.  Modified ferrographic
              techniques involving the addition of erbium to impart magnetic susceptibility
              to non-paramagnetic particles have been developed and used for collection of
              bacteria from laboratory solutions.  It is proposed to apply modified
              ferrographic techniques to aqueous environmental samples, to allow collection
              and analysis of colloidal phases and their associated contaminants.
