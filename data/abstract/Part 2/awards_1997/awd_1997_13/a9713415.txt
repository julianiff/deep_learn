We propose to study active control combustion dynamics, with
              particular emphasis on suppression of thermoacoustic instability. Our approach
              is to develop a systems framework which will include (a) models for the
              different components which contribute to the instability, e.g., the heat
              release dynamics, the acoustic dynamics, the actuator-sensor dynamics, (b) the
              effect of active feedback control on these components and their mutual
              interactions, and (c) self-tuning algorithms as part of the control design to
              allow changes in the operating conditions of the process.  Each subcomponent
              model will be studied in increasing order of complexities which are compatible
              with practical systems, e.g., heat release dynamic models for bluff
              body-stabilized combustion, in vortical structures in shear layers, from fuel
              injectors used as actuators, etc.  We will focus on showing, using a systems
              framework, how an overall controlled combustor model which is synthesized using
              these component models is capable of describing the subtle dynamic behavior
              observed in practical systems.  Particular attention will be given to an
              understanding of model-based control strategies that are based on the predicted
              response of the combustion systems using these models and that account for
              effects not previously understood, such as coupling among acoustic modes and
              coupling among different controller components and the combustor.
