Abstract    :
              9713022  Toth  This proposal is a collaborative effort between three states,
              Alabama, Florida and Georgia.  There are 27 counties in Alabama, 9 counties in
              Florida and 59 counties in Georgia that would be served by the proposal.    In
              Alabama, the PACERS program, organized by the Program for Rural Services and
              Research at the University of Alabama, where they have worked with a number of
              rural schools for several years.  In Florida, the Area Centers for Educational
              Enhancement created to address the state's Educational Reform and
              Accountability System.  The Area Centers provide professional development
              activities and technical assistance to assist in the implementation of the
              state's curriculum frameworks and assessment methods.  In Georgia, the
              coalition will seek to build upon the Georgia Pre-School through Post-Secondary
              (P16) statewide initiative.      ??
