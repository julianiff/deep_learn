Abstract    :
              The  World  Wide Web is fast becoming the de facto repository  of  preference
              for on-line information, yet the technology of the Web  has  inadvertently
              created barriers for people with disabilities.  Under this funding, the World
              Wide Web Consortium will create  an  International  Program Office for
              coordinating  five  Web-related  activities:   (1)  Technology  development; 
              (2)  Development  of  tools;  (3)  Guidelines  for  the  use  of  the 
              technology;  (4)  Educational  outreach; and (5) Research and advanced
              development.  The  Consortium will combine its own membership funds with  those
               of  foundations, industrial sponsors, the US Government, and  the  European 
              Commission  to fund the International  Program  Office.  This office will have
              its own director, with its own budget,  but  will  be  housed  in  and fully
              integrated with  the  Consortium.  Staff  members who coordinate the evolution
              of the Web  protocols  will  work  with the International Program Office to
              ensure  that  the  evolution  removes,  rather than  reinforces,  accessibility
               barriers.
