Abstract    :
              9713025  Pillai  This project will provide a cadre of rural high school science
              teachers with college-level coursework in physics.  As a consequence, the
              teachers will be able to earn state certification to teach physics at the high
              school level.  The PI will direct the curriculum over two academic years to
              allow the teachers to take the courses while continuing to teach their regular
              classes.  The courses will be structured to provide the teachers both physics
              content and pedagogy for teaching high school physics in both the classroom and
              the laboratory.  The project will involve 20 teachers in the poor, rural
              service area of Mississippi Valley State University.    The project is in
              itself not systemic, but is a teacher enhancement model.  It can, however,
              further systemic reform efforts in the area.  ??
