Abstract    :
              9713482  Hochbaum   This project will study three approaches to devising
              algorithms and analyzing their effectiveness for obtaining solutions to hard
              optimization problems.  These three approaches (1) probabilistic analysis of
              heuristic algorithms, (2) worst case analysis of heuristic algorithms, and (3)
              implicit enumerative algorithm design are often pursued separately, since the
              techniques involved are usually quite different.  Considerable insight can be
              gained by employing all three approaches in parallel.  Algorithm design is
              largely an ad hoc procedure, whether the goal is to devise an algorithm with
              good performance based on its average or worst case performance, or to provide
              bounding procedures within a branch-and-bound context.  This research will
              focus on devising unified techniques applicable to large problem classes.    
              The research is expected to generate, among other outcomes, a unified technique
              based on the choice of problem formulation and the application of specific
              types of transformation on the formulations that make obtaining good feasible
              solutions easy, at a  limited loss of optimality.  This technique has enormous
              potential for deriving approximation algorithms with good performance and
              generating tight bounds that are useful for enumerative algorithms.  The
              technique is also a unified approach applicable to a wide range of problems. 
              If the investigation using all three approaches is successful, it will provide
              new and useful methods for improving the quality of solutions for problems in
              areas varying from telecommunications and scheduling to locations, clustering
              and circuit testing.
