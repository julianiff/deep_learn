Abstract    :
              The investigators improve specification of the topside electron density and ion
              composition, using the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model. 
              Investigating the global and temporal variations of previously determined
              topside model parameters, they establish a functional description of these
              variations in terms of universal time, local time, season, solar cycle,
              magnetic activity and geographic and geomagnetic coordinates.  Using incoherent
              scatter data, they investigate the profile shape near the F peak, an activity
              necessary in merging the new topside model with F peak models applied in IRI. 
              In addition, they study global and temporal variation patterns of
              characteristic topside ion composition parameters; like the upper transition
              height, where ion gas consists to equal parts of light ions and atomic oxygen
              ions, and the ratio of ionized helium to ionized hydrogen.  The ultimate goal
              of these systematic evaluations is to establish parameters that are most
              influential in different altitude regimes and the underlying physics.
