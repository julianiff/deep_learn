Abstract    :
              Most solar flares are classified as impulsive, having hard X-ray spectra that
              become relatively more energetic (or 'harden') as fluxes increase, and 'soften'
              as fluxes decline.  Conversely, hard X-ray spectra associated with energetic
              interplanetary protons progressively 'harden' as fluxes decline.  Although
              coronal mass ejection-associated shocks may produce the majority of
              interplanetary protons, moderate numbers of high energy protons are also
              produced by progressively hardening flares; in fact, progressively hardening
              flares and coronal mass ejections often occur simultaneously.  Thus, the
              investigator will focus on this progressively hardening flare to optimize
              proton prediction algorithms for both hard X-rays and microwaves.  In addition,
              he pursues a collaboration for modeling the particle acceleration site with a
              particularly well-observed event, and new observations of hardening flares with
              a new hard X-ray spectrometer.
