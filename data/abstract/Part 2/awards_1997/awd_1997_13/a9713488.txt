Abstract    :
              This research project is aimed to derive and evaluate control algorithms for
              rapid adaptation of magnetic bearing dynamics during machining via
              multivariable gain-scheduling.  The tasks include: formulation of models of the
              spindle and cutting process suitable for development of robust gain-scheduled
              control algorithms; improvement of the underlying theoretical foundation for
              the synthesis of gain-scheduled controllers that are capable of modifying the
              feedback of magnetic bearings for stable cutting; development of numerical
              tools for the synthesis of gain-scheduled controllers for such systems;
              evaluation of the resulting control algorithms using numerical simulation of a
              magnetic bearing milling spindle; and experimental evaluation of gain-scheduled
              controllers for chatter suppression.  This type of magnetic bearing spindle
              control is unique in that the cutting process is treated as unknown dynamics to
              which to adapt, rather than an uncertainty with which to robust.  The project
              presents a new and unique approach on magnetic bearing spindle control.  The
              technology, if successfully developed, could result in significantly higher
              metal removal rates than those achievable by conventional spindles or with the
              currently available magnetic bearing technology.
