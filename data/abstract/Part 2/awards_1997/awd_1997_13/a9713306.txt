Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of electrochemical   processes for
              the generation of reactive intermediates.  Radical   trapping, the use of
              1,2-disilanes as synthons for 1,2-dications and 1,2   dications, the synthesis
              of quinodimethanes and related neutral entities,   the generation of
              1,3-dipolar species,  the electrocatalytic oxidation of   disilanes,  and the
              use of microemulsions as solvents for electrolysis   will all be investigated. 
              The replacement of common solvents with   microemulsions has the potential for
              environmentally friendly synthesis.    With this renewal award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program   is supporting the research of Dr. Albert J.
              Fry of the Department of   Chemistry at Weslyan University.  Professor fry will
              focus his work on   developing new synthetic applications based upon
              electrochemical   generation and trapping of a variety of reactive organic
              intermediates.    Success of the project could lead to conditions that replace
              conventional   solvents in industrial processes.
