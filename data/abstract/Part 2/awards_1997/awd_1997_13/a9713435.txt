Abstract    :
              Tomographic techniques, applied to ionospheric imaging, have provided many
              simulation studies to learn the nature of artifacts when reconstructions are
              based on imperfect data.  Scientists have also developed techniques to use
              subsidiary ionospheric information to increase the accuracy of reconstructions.
               Finally, validation measurements have enhanced confidence in these tomographic
              techniques.  These data, though, have been obtained mainly in campaign mode;
              hence, they aren't suitable for long-term behavior studies, needed to improve
              understanding of ionospheric weather.  One chain, known as the Low-latitude
              Ionospheric Tomography Network (LITN), covers the whole northern equatorial
              anomaly region.  The PI now gleans a set of LITN data, showing prominently the
              equatorial anomaly.  This feature, changing day by day, moves to a lower
              geomagnetic latitude with altitude, demonstrating typical equatorial
              ionospheric weather.  The anomaly is tied intimately to the dynamo electric
              field through a fountain effect, so the PI can also study this phenomenon.  In
              all, mining the LITN database is enhancing understanding of equatorial region
              ionospheric weather.
