Abstract    :
              9713327  Ettinger  NSF has been charged by Congress to coordinate the Federal 
              EPSCoR effort, which is distributed across 7 Federal  agencies.  Argonne, a
              federal laboratory sponsored by the  Department of Energy, is proposing to
              conduct a workshop and  roundtable for faculty from EPSCoR states.  The
              workshop and  roundtable would allow representatives from the EPSCoR  states to
              interact with Federal laboratory researchers for  the purpose of developing
              long-term research collaborations.    The workshop and roundtable would also
              serve as a model for  similar endeavors which would be funded by other EPSCoR 
              agencies.  The EPSCoR Interagency Coordinating Committee,  agencies with
              EPSCoR-like programs, has voiced its support  of this activity to the NSF
              EPSCoR staff.
