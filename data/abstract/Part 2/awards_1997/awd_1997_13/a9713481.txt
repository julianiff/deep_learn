Abstract    :
                    9713481  Gordis  The objective of this proposal is two-fold.  (1) The
              theoretical  and numerical-solution development of a high efficient, general 
              and exact integral equation formulation for transient structural  synthesis for
              large structural FE models with localized  nonlinearities and (2), its
              implementation in the optimization of  nonlinear transient response of large
              structural systems.    This research will involve the theoretical and numerical
               development of the nonlinear transient synthesis formulation.   The linear
              formulation has been developed (by the PI) and initial  development of the
              nonlinear formulation is currently under way.   A full theoretical development
              of the nonlinear integral equation  formulation will be carried out to include
              formal proofs of  solution existence and uniqueness for the cases of localized 
              nonlinear structural modifications, substructure coupling with  nonlinear
              interconnections, base excitation through nonlinear  elements, and semi-active
              control.    Subsequently a synthesis formulation will be further specifically 
              developed as a re-analysis methodology in structural optimization  involving
              nonlinear transient response constraints (or objective  function).  The
              optimization development will focus on the  application problems of passive and
              semi-active isolation for  seismic structural response and mechanical shock. 
              Design issues  will also be addressed.  ***
