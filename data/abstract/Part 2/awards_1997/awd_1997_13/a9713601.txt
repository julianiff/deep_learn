Abstract    :
              This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to Rice University   supports
              the research of Professor Scott F. Singleton.  The research   focuses on a
              molecular understanding of the strand exchange process   mediated by the RecA
              protein of Escherichia coli, a nucleic acid   recombinase.  The work formulates
              specific structural and mechanistic   models for the strand exchange process
              based on chemical kinetic   investigations into, for example, the influence of
              nucleotide   modifications on the kinetic parameters.  Transient and
              steady-state   kinetic experiments are performed using DNA strands which
              contain   nucleotide analogs that introduce conservative changes in the
              stabilities   and conformations of the substrate, product, and intermediate
              species.    The results allow characterization of the relationships between the
                kinetic and thermodynamic parameters associated with each identifiable   step
              in the exchange process and the physicochemical properties of the  
              participating DNA molecules.  The research advances the a molecular level
              understanding of homologous   genetic recombination, a biological process
              important in DNA repair,   replication, regulation, and differentiation.
