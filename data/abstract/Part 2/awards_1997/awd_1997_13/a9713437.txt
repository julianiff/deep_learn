Abstract    :
              9713437  Harris  Fiber reinforced plastic reinforcement, has been  demonstrated
              at Drexel University, in the  form of a ductile  hybrid rebar which simulates
              the stress-strain  characteristics of conventional steel reinforcement. 
              Starting with a combination of high modulus carbon and  aramic fibers, the
              researchers have produced a 5 mm diameter  rebar with a Young's modulus of 133
              Gpa, with an ultimate  strain between 2-3%.  Excellent bond was obtained by
              weaving  ribs into the bar to increase the mechanical interaction  between
              concrete and the rebar.  Results from tests indicate  that the ductility
              indices were comparable to steel.  An  analysis and experimental research
              program will be  undertaken using larger size rebars.  ***
