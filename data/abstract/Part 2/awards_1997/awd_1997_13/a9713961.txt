Abstract    :
              In August of 1962 the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) authorized a secret
              radioactive tracer experiment near a small creek on the northwest coast of
              Alaska.  The experiment contaminated the surrounding area with radioactive
              materials, a fact that the AEC kept from the people in the local communities. 
              The nearby community of Point Hope experienced an alarming  increase in the
              rate of cancer beginning approximately 20 years after the contamination. 
              Public health agencies, in response to concerns from community members,
              conducted three epidemiological studies in the 1980's.  Although the studies
              did not find the local cancer rates significant, Point Hopers doubted these
              conclusions.  Local `tales` had long focused on the possible relationship
              between cancer in the village and buried poisons left by scientists.  While the
              `discovery` of the contamination in 1992 seemed to vindicate the claims of
              Point Hopers, official scientific explanations dismissed the possible link
              between the contamination and cancer.  The proposed dissertation study
              investigates the scientific claims made about health risks in Point Hope.  It
              does this by focusing on what scientists said and how they said it.  The
              analysis will proceed by ironically juxtaposing realist and anti-realist 
              deconstructive strategies to investigate 1) how well the scientific claims made
              about the contamination in Point Hope meet with standard practices of
              scientific inquiry, and 2) the rhetorical strategies scientists used in
              claims-makings about the contamination in Point Hope.
