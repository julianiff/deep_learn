Abstract    :
              CMS 9713356  PI: John A. Nairn  University of Utah    New  techniques for
              solving fracture problems in  composites  that  treat  the  residual  stresses 
              commonly  arising   in  composite   materials   by   using  thermoelastic  
              fracture  mechanics  formulations are developed using  a  four-pronged 
              approach: the derivation of new exact thermoelastic fracture  analyses  
              specific  for  composites;  the  development   of  approximate   techniques 
              including   variational   fracture  mechanics, the analysis of observed finite
              fracture  events,  and experimental verification.  The exact techniques provide
               new tools for analysis of composite fracture and are used in  place  of 
              stress  intensity factor  techniques,  which  are  powerful  for isotropic and
              homogeneous materials,  but  are  much  less useful for composites. The
              approximate techniques  are   aimed   at   finding  general  tools  for  
              accurately  determining the quantities appearing in the exact  analyses.  These
               techniques will be based on new variational  theorems  that  will make it
              possible to derive useful upper and lower  bounds  for energy release rate. 
              The term "finite  fracture  events" refers to the observation that composites
              often fail  by  a  series  of  discrete  fracture  events  (e.g.,  fiber 
              fracture,  ply  cracking,  or  debonding)  rather  than   by  continuous crack
              growth.  The present work develops fracture  mechanics  tools  for  dealing
              with such  discrete  fracture  events. All analysis methods are verified by
              application  to  real and relevant failure processes in composite materials.
