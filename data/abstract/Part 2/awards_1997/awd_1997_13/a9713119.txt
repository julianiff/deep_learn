Abstract    :
              This project is a continuation of ongoing work supported by NSF.   The objective
              of the project is directed toward the understanding  of the processes
              associated with the Earth's aurora which generate  radio waves.  It is asserted
              that auroral associated radio waves  are neither understood theoretically nor
              fully described  observationally.  The project aims at radio-frequenct imaging
              by  constructing a radio-frequency interferometer at Sondrestrom,  Greenland, a
              location suited to the investigation of the phenomena  and one which is rich in
              additional complimentary diagnostic  measurements.  A series of coordinated
              ground-based and in situ  observations (with the FAST) satellite will be
              undertaken to test  proposed auroral radio wave generation mechanisms.
