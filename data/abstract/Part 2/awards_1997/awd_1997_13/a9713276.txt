Abstract    :
                This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry
              Program, is concerned with the dynamics of halogen  interactions with silicon
              surfaces.  Using molecular beam  scattering methods, Professor Ceyer and her
              colleagues at MIT  will test the hypothesis that the high reactivity of XeF2
              (as  compared with F atoms) with silicon is due to the large energy  transfer
              that occurs upon collision of the XeF2 molecule with the  silicon lattice. 
              This is counter to what would be expected  thermodynamically.  Using a range of
              fluorine`carriers` with  differing masses, this hypothesis will be directly
              tested.  In  addition, the detailed dynamics of abstractive chemisorption will 
              be probed by monitoring emission from electronically excited XeF*  species
              which may result from the interactions of XeF2 with the  silicon surface.  The
              etching of silicon by fluorine containing species forms a  part of silicon
              etching technology, with applications in the  production of electronic devices.
               This research project  addresses fundamental questions about the dynamics of
              surfaces.   Using a range of molecular beam and surface sensitive 
              spectroscopic methods, the effect of collisional excitation of  the silicon
              lattice on the reaction dynamics will be probed.  The  dynamics of abstractive
              dissociative chemisorption of fluorine  containing molecules will also be
              investigated.
