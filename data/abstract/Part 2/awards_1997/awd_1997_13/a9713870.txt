Abstract    :
              9713870  Blidberg  This grant provides support to encourage the participation 
              of Women and Under Represented Minorities in the student  paper competition at
              the 10th International Symposium on  Unmanned Untethered Submersible
              Technology.    The Autonomous Undersea Systems Institute has organized a 
              series of symposia focused on unmanned untethered  submersible technology.  The
              first Symposium was held in  1980 and the 10th in the series will be held
              September 7-10,  1997.  The symposium seeks to provide a mechanism for the 
              exchange of information among members of the research and  user community
              involved in the development of autonomous  underwater systems.  Technical
              papers are solicited and the  submitted abstracts are reviewed by active
              researchers  within the community.  Accepted papers are presented in an 
              informal atmosphere which encourages questions from  participants.  ***
