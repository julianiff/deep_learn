Abstract    :
              9713798  Paulino  Physically based models which can be used to predict and 
              optimize FGM mechanical performance are developed under this  project. Discrete
              and continuous FGMs are analyzed using the  boundary integral equations and the
              finite element methods,  respectively. Optimization of the compositional
              gradient by  means of numerical simulations provides relevant input for 
              material synthesis.  A novel technique known as Field-  Activated Combustion
              Synthesis (FACS), is used in the  synthesis process. Brittle FGM system,
              MOSi2/SiC, consisting  of two layers joined by a compositionally graded
              interface  sandwiched between the layers is used.  With different  applied
              electrical fields, different compositional profiles  are obtained for this
              system.  The spatial distribution of  the phase concentrations of Mo and Si are
              determined from  electron microprobe analysis. The distinct samples, with 
              various compositional profiles at the graded interface, are  tested by
              carefully placing a crack inside the  compositionally graded.layer. The
              fracture behavior of FGMs  with crack faces parallel and perpendicular to the
              property  gradient are investigated both experimentally and  numerically. The
              numerical models are calibrated by fracture  mechanics experiments. The
              influence of compositional  distribution functions on the structural behavior
              and the  mechanics of crack initiation and propagation in FGMs under 
              mechanical and/or thermal loads is studied. The study  contributes to the
              understanding of mechanical behavior and  optimal (or near optimal)
              compositional distribution  functions of MoSi,)/SiC and Ti3SiC2/SiC FGMs, in
              particular,  and to the actual design of FGMS, in general.  ***
