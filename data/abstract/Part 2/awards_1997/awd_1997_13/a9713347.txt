Abstract    :
              9713347  Forbes, Lewis  University of Kentucky    CISE Special Project: ADMI 97 
                    This grant provided travel assistance primarily for students along with a
              small number of faculty from minority-serving institutions to participate in
              the 1997 ADMI Symposium, "Increasing Diversity in Research and Education". 
              This 1997 Symposium built on the major new themes initiated in the 1996
              Symposium: 1) enabling minority-serving faculty to present papers on strategies
              for increasing the number of CISE-discipline students from underrepresented
              populations and to share these topics with representatives from major research
              universities, and 2) providing for significant participation by students,
              giving them valuable experience in presenting research papers and providing for
              their involvement in graduate study workshops.  Participants were chosen by a
              selection committee following submission of their papers.  A Conference
              Proceedings is being published containing all of the papers presented at the
              conference.
