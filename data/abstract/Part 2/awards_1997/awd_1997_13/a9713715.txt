Abstract    :
              This research addresses the surface modification of two classes of materials
              using a specially designed device in which fibers, wires, and powders can be
              surface modified.  The materials will be exposed to a plasma in which an
              organic monomer is injected. The objective of this research project is to
              design, build, and thoroughly test two bench-top size reactors in which bundles
              of fibers and batches of powdery materials can be coated with
              plasma-polymerized films.  This technology will constitute a new process for
              surface modification of these materials which is nonpolluting, as opposed to
              existing technologies which usually employ solvents.   One attractive aspect of
              a plasma polymerization process for surface modification of materials is that a
              wide range of polymers with different properties can be obtained from one
              monomer.  Thus, the film can be tailored to the application in terms of
              adhesion, chemical and thermal stability, mechanical and other properties. 
              Additional important aspects of the process are the low energy requirements and
              the absence of solvents, making the process environmentally attractive.
