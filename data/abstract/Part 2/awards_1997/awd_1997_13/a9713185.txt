Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9713185      This proposal requests funds for partial support of
              the Gordon Research  Conference on the Chemistry of Supramolecules and
              Assemblies to be held on August 10- 15, 1997, at Salve Regina University in
              Newport Rhode Island.  The funds request will be used primarily to cover the
              fixed fee expenses for attendees, i.e. speakers, discussion leaders and
              graduate and postdoctoral students who work in engineering and applied
              research.    The purpose of this conference is to encourage the transfer of
              ideas and information in the community of scientists who work in the fields of
              colloidal assemblies and supramolecular aggregates.  The conference has met
              biennially since 1979 and the areas covered and the speakers who attend
              consistently represent the most active areas of research from industrial
              applications of thin films and engineered crystals to basic research in
              molecular recognition and association colloid chemistry.    A broad range of
              speakers and participants in a variety of research areas are participating in
              the conference this year.  Topics include, nanosized materials, structure and
              dynamics, clean chemistry in structured systems, photochemistry in organized
              systems, chemistry in aggregates, macromolecular architecture, and biomolecular
              assemblies.  Approximately one half of the speakers and discussion leaders are
              either engineers or working in applied chemistry.  One session is devoted to
              short talks by new participants in the field.    The schedule for the week is
              that of a traditional Gordon Conference, sessions in the morning and evenings
              with plenty of time for discussion.  The afternoons are free for informal
              discussion and meetings and two poster sessions are planned for attendees,
              including graduate students and post doctoral fellows as well as faculty
              members, to present their recent work.
