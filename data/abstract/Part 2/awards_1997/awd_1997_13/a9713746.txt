Abstract    :
              Despite the significant progress research has made in mitigating the damage to
              portland cement concrete from ice formation and propagation, frost action
              continues to cause serious damage to structures exposed to the elements.  P.I.s
              plan to use a new microscopic technique using `directional cooling` to
              undertake a comprehensive research program on ice formation and propagation in
              concrete and its components.  This study will characterize the ice morphology
              and velocity in various concrete pore solutions, it will establish local
              concentrations of super-cooled water and it will determine the dynamics of ice
              propagation in concrete as a function of different amounts of air-entrained
              voids and deicers.  The interaction of ice crystals with the concrete
              microstructure will be characterized at high magnifications using a
              new-generation field emission low-temperature scanning microscope, which allows
              the study of ice formation in small voids.  The relationship between the ice
              formation in concrete  and the development of microcracks will be established
              using a recently developed acoustic emission set-up.  The test results will
              create a link between microstructure and microcracking as affected by cooling
              rate,  presence of deicers, and amount of air entrainment in the matrix.  The
              results of this integrated research program will help the development of the
              next generation of high-performance concretes to be used in the repair of the
              aging reinforced concrete infrastructure exposed to cold climate.
