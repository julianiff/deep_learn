Abstract    :
              9713385  Whitesides  Funding is provided to support preliminary investigations
              of organic and inorganic materials functionality in MEMS structures.  These
              materials promise significant impact in a variety of potential applications
              currently not realized by Si-based MEMS activities.  ***
