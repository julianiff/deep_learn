Abstract    :
              9713946  Silver    The PIs propose a multi-disciplinary study to develop models
              of the dynamical, thermal and compositional evolution of the sub-continental
              upper mantle which are directly constrained by seismic shear wave splitting and
              geologic and petrologic data sets.  The team will develop and test a model that
              incorporates viscous heat production in an attempt to reconcile seemingly
              conflicting data sets which suggest that sub-continental mantle, specifically
              sub-continental lithosphere, is anomalously hot during orogeny and yet is not
              removed during orogeny.  ***
