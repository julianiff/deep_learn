Abstract    :
              9713286  Ataai  Purification of a target protein constitutes the major  fraction
              of the total cost of its production.  The high cost  of purification often
              limits the availability of such  proteins, which in turn impedes studies in
              immunology,  vaccine development, and the production of pharmaceutical  and
              diagnostic reagents for human health care.  Although  immunoaffinity
              purification should allow for purification of  such target proteins, it suffers
              from a number of  shortcomings including high cost of the ligand, and, in some 
              cases, strong binding of the target protein to the antibody,  which could
              require the use of extremes of pH or other harsh  conditions for the elution of
              the protein.  IMAC has shown  promise for the purification of proteins fused to
              metal  affinity tails.  Based on preliminary results, screening of 
              combinatorial peptide libraries may identify peptides  capable of purifying
              target fusion proteins in one  chromatography step with high recovery, purity,
              and low  cost.  ***
