Abstract    :
              9713645  Mazumder   This GOALI award will conduct research on precision
              machining with novel industrial lasers, jointly by the (University of Michigan
              and the General Electric Corporate Research and Development Center.  GE
              Engineers will make visits to the University of Michigan, for the duration of
              one to two weeks each time, in order to conduct the joint research.  The
              research objective is to understand the interactions between laser beam and
              machined material as a function of wavelength, intensity, and interaction time
              using a new generation of industrial lasers.  Focus will be given to processing
              of advanced materials using parameters such as high average power, high peak
              power, high beam quality, and various wavelengths which were not available in
              the previous laser systems.   The collaborative research will generate
              fundamental understanding of precision manufacturing with novel industrial
              lasers.  The research result could propel widespread industrial applications of
              this technology.  Also, the industry presence on campus could foster close
              university-industry interactions which are valuable to updating engineering
              education programs and preparation of future talents with advanced knowledge on
              emerging technologies.                  2
