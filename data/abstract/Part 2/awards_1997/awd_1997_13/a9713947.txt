Abstract    :
               This award has two central objectives:  (1) Development of a thermodynamic
              characterization of degradation dynamics employing entropy (thermodynamic
              disorder) as the fundamental measure of degradation, and (2) Development of
              methods of measurement of state variables that are functionally related to
              entropy.  The research tasks include: application of thermodynamic principles
              to characterize component degradation and lifetime, characterization of initial
              component lifetime, development of a mathematical framework for study of
              stochastic degradation dynamics, and development of methods for measurement of
              entropy related state variables.  Through a theoretical and experimental
              investigation of degradation in machinery components, the project hopes to
              advance a scientific understanding of degradation dynamics, leading to improved
              engineering maintenance practice.   This research could build a strong
              foundation for maintenance science that can potentially impact many
              manufacturing industries such as the semiconductor and aerospace industries.
