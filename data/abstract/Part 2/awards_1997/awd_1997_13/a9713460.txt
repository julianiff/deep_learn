Abstract    :
              This program will determine how well geomagnetic storms can be predicted from
              magnetic polarities and orientation of disappearing filaments (DF) and soft
              x-ray arcades on the Sun.  The PI will specifically address whether the
              topology of these fields is usually preserved upon eruption.  The approach will
              involve:  (1) a large data base of DFs, essentially independent of flares, for
              which the bounding polarities and geometrical orientations of preexisting
              filaments have been measured, (2) a determination of these properties for a
              data set of large-scale coronal x-ray arcades observed by Yohkoh, (3) the solar
              locations of the filaments and arcades into GSM coordinates so geometrical
              coupling effects influencing the occurrence rate and severity of storms can be
              accounted for, and (4) a superposed epoch analysis technique to compare
              different sets of the DF and arcade data with storm indices and a storm data
              set to determine which solar parameters are most geoeffective.  The project
              results will improve understanding of solar mass ejecta characteristics that
              are most geoeffective, thereby enhancing the prediction of moderate to large
              storms, key to forecasting space weather.
