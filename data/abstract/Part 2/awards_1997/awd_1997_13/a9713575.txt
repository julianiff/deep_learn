Abstract    :
              Using the Cornell University Portable Radar Interferometer (CUPRI), the
              investigator studies plasma instabilities in the equatorial electrojet,
              equatorial spread-F, mid-latitude sporadic-E, and mid-latitude spread-F areas. 
              Having acquired data from recent campaigns for the first three regions, the
              investigator will continue to examine their features.  For instance, the
              Doppler shift of type-I waves observed at vertical incidence decreases with
              height...if the shift were only dependent on the acoustic speed, we'd expect an
              increase with height.  The investigator questions the regularity of these
              features, and will examine other days for these effects and relevant theories. 
              Students also continue to benefit from experimenting with CUPRI operations,
              data analysis, and data interpretation, making this program both effective and
              attractive to international participation.
