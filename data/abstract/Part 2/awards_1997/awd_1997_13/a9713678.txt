Abstract    :
              The Skidaway Institute of Oceanography is a small,  autonomous research unit of
              the University System of  Georgia, with 15 research faculty and 40 permanent
              support  staff.  It was established in 1967 with the mandate to  conduct
              research in all fields of oceanography and the  marine sciences and to serve as
              a base of operations and  central facility for any of the research and
              educational  institutions in the State of Georgia.  This mandate and the 
              Institute's remote pristine location, convenient to coastal  and shelf waters,
              guarantee a constant influx of visiting  scientists and student seeking access
              to Skidaway's  state-of-the-art research facilities, accessible research 
              locations, and opportunities for collaboration with  Skidaway's
              interdisciplinary and internationally-recognized  research faculty.    Four
              older housing units are at least fifty years old and  are in need of
              substantial repair and restoration to  maintain their current habitability. 
              Among the necessary  tasks for this project are: replacing the elderly shingle 
              roofs of all four units; removing three units from septic  tank systems and
              connecting them to the sewer system;  replacing windows in one unit; re-siding
              and insulating two  units; bringing all four unit up to code in fire safety
              with  the inclusion of firewalls and hardwired fire alarms;  upgrading
              electrical service to two units; replacing  decrepit kitchen and bathroom
              facilities in two units; and  completing plumbing upgrades in all four units.
