Abstract    :
               This project will explore the development of quantitative models to describe
              the critical parameters that govern damage in drilling of laminated composites
              and will develop intelligent control strategies for machining of composites
              coupling these models.  The delamination based drilling models will be
              validated by using instrumented tools and workpiece fixtures and applying
              acoustic emission techniques to detect the onset of this damage.  An
              intelligent controller will be developed to learn key parameters in the process
              and select the optimal operating conditions for maintaining both a high
              production rate and superior quality of the finished workpiece.     The project
              has a high potential to significantly impact machining of composites.  If the
              delamination problem in composite machining is solved, the application of
              composites can be substantially widened.
