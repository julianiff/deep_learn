The Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) operated by
              Cornell University since 1978, is a national user facility that provides high
              energy X-ray synchrotron radiation services to the scientific community. 
              Experimental studies carried out at CHESS impact the scientific fields of
              condensed matter physics, chemistry, materials science and engineering,
              biology, and geology.  Integral parts of the CHESS program are MacCHESS, the
              NIH-funded macromolecular resource, and the NSF-based National Facility for
              High Pressure Research.  The program at CHESS is designed to enhance the
              national science infrastructure by taking advantage of unique aspects of the
              CHESS environment to provide research capabilities not available at other
              synchrotron x-ray sources.  

CHESS is a user oriented facility which accepts
              proposals from all qualified investigators on a comptetive basis.  In addition
              to providing operating costs, this project supports the development of
              synchrotron radiation facilities using high  power photon levels provided by
              the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR).   At present, more than 500
              individuals per year from universities, industries, and national laboratories,
              conduct research on the public experimental stations provided by CHESS. 
              

Under this award CHESS staff will continue to operate CHESS to build on
              current user programs.  These programs include enhancing existing capability,
              providing new user capabilities in materials and biological sciences, the
              development of advanced instrumentation, and the integration of research and
              education through the training of students.
