Abstract    :
              ***  9713008  Paulino  A novel computational approach for the study of multiple 
              interacting crack systems with nonlinear material response  is developed. The
              hypersingular boundary integral equations  along with the Galerkin
              approximations is used in this  formulation. These allow to circumvent the
              computational  difficulties and smoothness requirements of the alternative 
              formulations available in the literature. These developments  play a
              significant role in the failure analysis of important  classes of materials
              such as composites with one or more  ductile constituents.***
