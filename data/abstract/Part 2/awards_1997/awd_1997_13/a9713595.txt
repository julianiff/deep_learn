Abstract    :
              The investigator continues working with fluid and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
              equations to assess turbulence in solar phenomena such as the extended solar
              corona, solar wind, magnetosphere, and interstellar medium.  Turbulence plays a
              critical role in coronal physics leading to the origin of the solar wind,
              mediation of space weather by energy transfer through the heliospheric plasma
              and energetic particles, and turbulent diffusion of energetic particles
              impacting the outer heliosphere structure.  The investigator further elucidates
              basic properties of MHD turbulence.  He integrates MHD and fluid simulation
              techniques, transport theory with numerical implementations, analytical theory
              of turbulence and particle diffusion, and related analysis and interpretation
              based on spacecraft observations.
