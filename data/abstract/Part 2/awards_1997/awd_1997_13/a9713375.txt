Abstract    :
              9713375  Parise    Strategies to produce novel crystalline microporous solids
              will  be explored for a new class of open framework metal chalcogenide 
              materials. The research will focus on 1) further development of  unusual and
              traditional synthetic strategies for the production  of open frameworks; 2)
              determination of the crystal structures;  3) implementation of the small
              environmental cell for real time  srudies and other in situ devices to aid in
              understanding  reactions under hydrothermal conditions, measuring thermal 
              stability under vacuum and flowing gas, and structural changes  accompanying
              ion exchange, gas loading and intercalation; 4)  development of techniques for
              data collection and structure  solution from microcrystals and powders at
              synchrotron sources;  5) characterization of th estability, optical and ion
              exchange  properties, and correlation of these with structure.  %%%  Open
              structured metal-chalcogenides represent a relatively new  class of materials
              with potential areas of application such as  selective sorbents,
              ion-exchangers, ion-conductors and hosts for  inclusion chemistry.  ***
