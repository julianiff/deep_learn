                PROJECT SUMMARY/Vali, 9712859/McIntosh, 9713778    Airborne Studies of Clouds
              and Precipitation with a Millimeter Wavelength Radar    Since 1989, with
              support by the Physical Meteorology Program, the Microwave Remote Sensing 
              Laboratory, at the University of Massachusetts and the Department of
              Atmospheric Science, at the   University of Wyoming have collaborated in the
              design, development, installation, and application of  a 95GHz, airborne,
              Doppler, polarimetric radar.  This award provides further support for
              development  and application of the airborne millimeter-wavelength radar, in
              combination with in-situ measurements  from the King Air    Hardware and
              software improvements to be implemented include addition of selectable filters
              to match  a variety of pulse lengths, use of a new calibration technique to
              improve the minimum detectable Linear  Depolarization Ratio, development of the
              capability to measure reflectivity at closer range (to improve  comparisons
              with the in-situ probes), and development of a new device to allow switching
              the beam  between fore and aft directions on a pulse-by-pulse basis.     Cloud
              and precipitation research will focus on 1) continued study of Florida cumulus
              clouds, including  contrasting clouds of maritime and continental origins,
              retrieval of  x-z wind cross-sections with a  pseudo-dual Doppler merging of
              the millimeter radar and CP-2 radar data, 2) extension of the Airborne 
              Velocity Azimuth Display method to study wave-like features in Oregon stratus,
              3 exploration of  polarimetric capabilities, including comparisons of measured
              and modeled co-polarized and cross-  polarized backscafler for different
              ice-crystal populations, and 4) quantifying the uncertainties associated  with
              measured and predicted reflectivities.  In addition, we propose to mount the
              millimeter-wavelength  radar on the French F-27 research aircraft, for
              pseudo-dual Doppler studies of boundary layer cumulus  dynamics in a field
              observational program in France known as TRAC98.  This is n ot only a good 
              international collaboration, but also very cost-effective for the NSF-funded
              research.
