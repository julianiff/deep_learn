Abstract    :
              The PI will contribute to quantitative understanding of ionospheric stimulated
              electromagnetic emission (SEE) through theoretical and numerical simulation
              models.  SEE is a powerful diagnostic tool for nonlinear processes produced
              during ionospheric modification experiments, and may also be used for general
              nonlinear processes in plasmas.  This investigation utilizes magnetized,
              kinetic numerical models not used in past investigations, but essential for
              further progress in studying SEE.  Specifically, the PI will:  (1) provide a
              more comprehensive study of three-wave parametric decay processes proposed to
              produce downshifted sidebands in the SEE spectrum; (2) study four-wave decay
              processes proposed to produce prominent upshifted sideband features in the SEE
              spectrum; and (3) study the broadband continuum feature in the SEE spectrum,
              proposed to result from strongly turbulent interactions in the background
              plasmas.
