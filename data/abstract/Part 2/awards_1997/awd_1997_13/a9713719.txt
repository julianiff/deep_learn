Abstract    :
              This research develops a comprehensive model of wave induced heating of the
              ionosphere to investigate these processes.  The investigator will develop a
              two-dimensional model and obtain numerical solutions for specified conditions. 
              Studies will focus on:  (1) HF heating ranging from D-region to F-region of the
              ionosphere; (2) self-focusing instabilities induced field-aligned
              irregularities; (3) extremely low frequency/very low frequency generation due
              to temporal modulation and spatial modulation; and (4) electron energization
              due to the spatially localized electric fields and the associated enhancements
              in the optical and infrared emissions.  This research will have applications in
              communications, underground explorations, diagnostics of ionospheric
              parameters, and infrared countermeasures.
