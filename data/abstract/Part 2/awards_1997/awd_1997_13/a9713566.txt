Abstract    :
              9713566  Bank  This project will study the energy-absorption capacity of 
              composite material tubes when loaded in bending.  The  ability to absorb energy
              in flexural deformation is required  in framed structural systems.  This
              flexural energy  absorption capacity is a central tenant of the design 
              philosophy of steel and reinforced concrete structures,  since it allows these
              structures to develop "plastic-hinge"  mechanisms prior to failure. Such
              "hinges" provide reserve  capacity, overall ductility, and an all-important
              safeguard  against catastrophic failure.  It is the objective of  this  project
              to demonstrate that pseudo-plastic hinges can  develop in composite material
              tubular beams,  thus,  imparting to composite structural frames an energy- 
              absorption capacity analogous to that found in conventional  steel or
              reinforced concrete frames.  The mechanism by which  a composite material
              tubular beam develops "stable" energy  absorption is, however, very different
              from that of a steel  or reinforced concrete beam.  In these conventional
              beams,  the energy absorption is obtained due to irreversible  plastic strain
              in the elasto-plastic materials.  It is the  purpose of this study to show that
              in a composite material  tubular beam, energy is absorbed in a stable manner by
               progressive "tearing failure" at the tube corners, and that  this provides the
              beam with a behavior analogous to that of  an elasto-plastic beam.  Such a
              phenomenon has recently been  reported but an in-depth study has not been
              conducted.  This  research will investigate the phenomenon in-depth, by use of 
              experimentation and numerical modeling, and provide  recommendations for
              design.  ***
