Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9713935  DAYTE    This award is to provide funding for the
              Industry/University Research Center on Microengineered Ceramics at the
              University of New Mexico for its phase down period, as well as for a supplement
              for Research Experience for Undergraduates.  The Center has been funded by the
              National Science Foundation since 1998.  The research has been highly
              productive with more than $2 million in annual support from its industrial and
              governmental partners.  Some of the research topics at the Center are
              fundamentals of sol-gel film formation, ceramics with controlled pore size,
              liquid routes to supported dense mixed metal oxide membranes, synthesis of
              dielectric ceramics with controlled microstructure, aerosol synthesis of
              ceramics, etc.  The objectives of the Center are to develop new technology for
              microengineered ceramics, to transfer technology to industry for commercial
              development, to educate students for the materials science industry, to assist
              the development of high-tech companies through the small business innovative
              research programs (SBIR), especially in the state of New Mexico.  The
              undergraduate students are involved in the research activities of the Center
              with faculty mentors in teams of graduate and undergraduate students.
