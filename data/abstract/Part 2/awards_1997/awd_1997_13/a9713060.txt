Abstract    :
              In 1995, a national task force was convened to determine if the user community
              could arrive at a mutually acceptable way of describing system software and
              tool requirements that should be supported in a consistent way across HPC
              platforms.  The result was a collection of Guidelines for Writing System
              Software and Tools Requirements for Parallel and Clustered Computers, which
              included a specification for a Baseline Development Environment (BDE).  It was
              formally endorsed by the National Coordination Office for HPCC in May of 1996. 
              The project will extend the work begun by the 1995 tack force, in two ways. 
              First, a national database will be established to make information available on
              how individual agencies have applied BDE criteria in procurements of HPC
              systems.  Second, a new national task force will be convened to revise and
              update the BDE. To ensure that the viewpoints of both users and vendors are
              represented, the  proposed work will be carried out under the auspices of the
              Parallel Tools Consortium (Ptools).
