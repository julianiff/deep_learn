Abstract    :
              The project studies the multi-stream approach to automatic speech  recognition 
              (ASR)  using stream definitions  in  the  modulation  spectrum  domain.  The
              multi-stream approach is  a  new  acoustic  modeling technique to increase the
              robustness of ASR systems.  It  derives different information sub-streams from
              the speech  signal  followed   by  independent  feature  extraction  and 
              probability  estimation  in  each sub-stream. The vectors of class-conditional 
              probabilities obtained from each sub-stream are merged to  obtain  the final
              decision. The multi-band model which utilizes different  regions  of  the
              frequency spectrum in the sub-streams  has  been  shown  to be robust to
              frequency-selective degradation.  The  aim  of  the  project is to utilize
              different ranges of the modulation  spectrum  in  different  sub-streams.  A
              study  of  the  relative  importance  of  the  different ranges of the
              modulation  spectrum  indicates that they might carry different information.
              This makes  the  various  elements  of  the modulation  spectrum  interesting 
              candidates  for  the  multi-stream approach. The  computation  of  these 
              features  requires looking at longer  segments  (typically  syllable length
              segments) of the signal.  The proposed project is  an  attempt to apply the new
              assumptions of relative independence  of   elements   of  the  feature  vector 
              and  medium-term   time  dependencies  between  feature vectors to  ASR  with 
              a  view  to  improve its robustness.
