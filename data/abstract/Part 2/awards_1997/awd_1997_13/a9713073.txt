Abstract    :
              9713073  Poulos  While gravity waves have received increasing recognition for
              their role in  atmospheric dynamics, the significance of gravity-wave-induced,
              near surface  perturbations have not been studied to any significant degree. 
              Under this award, the  Principal Investigator will use numerical simulations
              and detailed analysis of  dynamics to investigate the interaction of
              topographically forced gravity waves and  the terrestrial atmospheric boundary
              layer (ABL).  The Principal Investigator will  investigate: how the
              perturbations to the lower troposphere due to evolving mountain  waves create
              boundary layer flow variability; and  the influence of the diurnally  evolving
              ABL on mountain wave characteristics, such as momentum transport,  breaking,
              and reflection.  An understanding of the feedbacks between these two 
              atmospheric phenomena will also be pursued.        Analysis will focus on
              results from a non-hydrostatic, primitive equation,  mesoscale model, which
              will be run for a series of 3-dimensional, idealized  simulations of increasing
              complexity.  There will be three types of control  simulations: 1) the diurnal
              cycle of boundary layer flow without mountain wave  influence, 2) mountain
              waves without boundary layer influence, and 3) ducted lee  waves without
              boundary layer influence.   Particular attention will be given to  periods when
              the mountain wave is breaking and micro-timescale interactions are  likely.    
                  It is expected that these studies will yield a far more complete
              understanding  of how topographically induced gravity waves and the lower
              tropospheric boundary  layer mutually interact.  Potentially this research
              could yield insights and  improvement in forecasting of the severity of wind
              gusts in complex terrain   ***
