              9713978  Valley  9714028  Eiler, Stolper    Abstract  This award supports a
              collaborative study of the micron-scale  distribution of oxygen isotopes
              (18O/16O) and carbon isotopes  (13C/12C) in carbonates, silicates, oxides and
              possibly reduced  carbon-bearing phases in the "Martian" meteorite (SNC class
              of  meteorites), ALH84001, using the ion microprobe.  It is supported  by the
              Office of Polar Programs, the Chemistry Division, and the  MPS Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities.  This work will  provide constraints on the
              thermal and fluid-infiltration history  experienced by this rock and the
              possible biogenic origin of  ALH84001 carbonate.    This work will build on a
              previously completed pilot study  comprised of over 500 analyses of 12 well
              characterized carbonate  standards, 11 oxygen isotope analyses in ALH84001
              silicates, and  9 oxygen isotope analyses coupled with 4 carbon isotope
              analyses  in ALH84001 carbonate concretions.  This pilot study demonstrated 
              the presence of gradients in the oxygen isotope composition of  more than 10
              parts in 10,000 in ALH84001 carbonates over 10's of  microns, showing that
              there is sufficient `signal' in the fine-  scale stable isotope variations of
              these minerals for us to  extract meaningful information from our proposed
              analyses.    Further characterization of the oxygen isotope zonation and 
              search for low carbon-13 phases will be critical to interpreting  the
              environment of formation of these carbonate concretions.  The  heterogeneity
              already documented in this sample indicates that  much of this work will only
              be possible using ion microprobe  techniques.  The research work to be
              completed under this award  includes a large number of analyses of 10-30 micron
              spots (about  5-10 microns deep) in a variety of carbonate, silicate and iron 
              bearing minerals to establish compositional profiles for oxygen  and carbon
              isotopes.    These new analyses will allow the following: (1) test concretions 
              for core-to-rim oxygen zonation; (2) test and refine previo us  estimates of
              the temperatures of formation of the various  carbonate mineral phases; (3)
              investigate the fluid-infiltration  history recorded by non-carbonate phases,
              and (4) verify initial  observations that the outer portions of carbonate
              concretions may  contain low carbon-13 compositions, which may be related to 
              purported `biofilms' at concretion margins that have been  inferred in
              meteorite ALH84001.  These analyses will evaluate  published reports that the
              fractionation of carbon isotopes  between carbonate and associated reduced
              carbon is consistent  with biological processes.  These constraints are central
              to the  interpretation of the origin of carbonates in ALH84001, both with 
              regard to the possibility of their biogenic origin and the  evidence they
              provide of the nature of volatiles on early Mars.
