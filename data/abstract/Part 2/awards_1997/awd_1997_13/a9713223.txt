Abstract    :
              The investigator will consider four issues basic to improving the understanding
              of diffusive acceleration of particles at shocks:  (1) 'injection' of low
              energy or thermal particles into the diffusive shock acceleration process, (2)
              generation and evolution of the strong turbulence responsible for scattering
              the energetic particles in the vicinity of a shock, (3) development of
              non-quasi-linear models of the cosmic ray/energetic particle diffusion
              coefficients, and (4) shock acceleration in a partially ionized medium.  The
              study will develop models addressing these points, and investigate on the basis
              of analytical and numerical techniques.  He will derive models at both a test
              particle and self-consistent level.  Detailed modeling will be guided and
              complemented by multi-dimensional (1-, 2-, and 3-D) hybrid plasma simulations. 
              The investigator hopes these studies will advance our understanding of the
              origin and acceleration of energetic particles and the nature of collisionless
              shocks.
