Abstract    :
              This project will undertake a systematic evaluation of the possible  operational
              use of global MHD simulations.  This will be  accomplished by simulating a
              broad range of conditions using the  Lyon MHD code (a very mature MHD model)
              and the results of the  simulations will be compared with data.  An evaluation
              of model  simplifications and reduced resolution to enhance the computational 
              speed will be undertaken.  The effort will concentrate on  identifying the
              conditions under which the model output would be  operationally useful.
