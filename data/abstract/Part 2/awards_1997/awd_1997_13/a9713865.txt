Abstract    :
              9713865  Chandrasekar   Based on the results of preliminary experiments on
              drilling with low-frequency vibrations, this project will fully explore the
              underlying phenomena that occur when vibratory motion is superimposed on
              drilling.  The effect of this vibratory motion will be explored for hard
              metallic materials including hardened steel, stainless steel, and titanium, as
              well as for soft materials including aluminum and lead.  Experiments will be
              conducted with drills having various geometries and made of different
              materials, and with lubricants of both oil and water soluble types.  The
              investigation will include torque and thrust, hole quality, friction at the
              drill-chip interface, and the morphological characteristics of the chips
              produced.   The study of vibration superimposed drilling could generate
              fundamental knowledge about this process and lead to substantial improvement in
              the quality and productivity of drilling.  The research results could also help
              understand other vibration superimposed manufacturing processes.
