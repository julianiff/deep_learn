Abstract    :
               This university-industry collaboration research project seeks to understand the
              subsurface damage resulting from ultra-fine finishing processes in the
              manufacture of wide band-gap semiconductor substrates.  This understanding will
              aid in identifying the processing conditions that can overcome subsurface
              damage problems in producing these substrates.  Substrates of II-VI
              semiconductor materials including ZnSe, CdS and ZnO will be prepared by a
              variety of surface processing methods including ultra-precision machining and
              polishing.  The resulting subsurface lattice disorder will be assessed with the
              use of ion beam channeling, cathodoluminescent, and scanning capacitance
              microscopy.  Subsequent to surface characterization, epitaxial films will be
              grown on the substrates by molecular beam epitaxy, and will be used to do
              performance testing.  The project will be conducted in collaboration with
              Eagle-Picher Research Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the
              National Institute of Standards and Technology.   The project can lead to a
              fundamental understanding of subsurface damage in the ultra-fine finishing of
              semiconductor substrates, with significant practical benefits in the production
              of LEDs and lasers among others.  A major strength of the project is the
              existence of strong partnerships with industry and government laboratories.
