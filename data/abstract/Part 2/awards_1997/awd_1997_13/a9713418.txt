Abstract    :
              This investigators will apply existing models of the ionosphere,
              electrodynamics, and instability growth rates to examine techniques for
              developing short-term forecasting of propagation disturbances of the equatorial
              ionosphere.  The study will make use of the WestPac Project, an NSF-funded
              chain of ionospheric stations measuring parameters that control the
              Rayleigh-Taylor instability, the source of equatorial spread F instabilities. 
              Equatorial spread F produces disruption to the ionosphere that affects radio
              communication and is thus an important element of space weather.  The model
              developed in this study will take advantage of the meridional specification of
              ionospheric conditions to characterize the conditions under which equatorial
              spread F forms.  The study will also develop means by which ionospheric data
              can be assimilated into a forecasting model that can be run on a low-cost
              personal computer.
