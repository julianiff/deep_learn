Abstract    :
              9713206  House    Extreme flooding in western Nevada in early January 1997 has
              provided a scientifically important opportunity to collect ephemeral field data
              that can serve to characterize the physical signature of large flood events in
              both fluvial and lacustrine environments in this region.  Historical weather
              and streamflow records from affected river basins in western Nevada indicate
              that previous, comparably extreme events have resulted from analogous
              hydroclimatological and hydrometeorological  phenomena.  Thus, it is likely
              that the largest paleoflood events preserved in fluvial and lacustrine settings
              in the region resulted from generally similar circumstances.  The proposed data
              collection effort will focus on high-water mark distribution and flood deposit
              characteristics in selected river reaches to evaluate both the fidelity of
              persistent flood features to peak flood stages and the sedimentological
              characteristics of extreme flood deposits in a variety of depositional
              settings.  In selected lacustrine environments, water, ostracode, and mollusk
              samples are being collected at regular intervals to document time-dependent
              changes in geochemical characteristics of both biotic and abiotic lacustrine
              phenomena.  The ultimate goal of the project is to develop robust geomorphic,
              sedimentologic, and geochemical analogs that can be used to discern similarly
              extreme events in the stratigraphic record in fluvial and lacustrine
              environments typical of this region.  It is important to collect the field data
              as soon as possible because much of the flood evidence is either ephemeral,
              time-dependent, or subject to modification through ongoing mitigation efforts. 
              Impending spring runoff provides an additional unique opportunity to compare
              and contrast the effects from distinctly different types of hydrologic events.
