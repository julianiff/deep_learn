Abstract    :
              ***  9713365  Litke  This grant will support the initial development of a system
               to study how the retina process and encodes a visual image.  This "Retinal
              Readout System" will allow the simultaneous  detection of signals from
              thousands of output cells in live  retinal tissue as a visual image is focused
              on the cells.  The signals from the output neurons will be detected in real- 
              time, in a single retinal preparation, with all spatial and  temporal
              correlations recorded.  This system will be based, in large part, on technology
               developed in the field of high energy physics for the study  of short-lived
              particles: the technology of silicon  microstrip detectors.  The silicon
              detector techniques to  implement the Retinal Readout System include:
              high-density  wire-bonding, custom-designed analog VLSI readout chips, and 
              fast data acquisition.  The specific items to be developed  include a variety
              of electrode arrays for the detection of  the retinal signals, a prototype VLSI
              chip (the "Neurochip")  for reading out the electrode arrays, and a fast data 
              acquisition system based on an analog-to-digital converter  module installed in
              a PC.  ***
