Abstract    :
                    9713337  Pallrand    The Waksman Institute of Rutgers The State University
              provides a Research Experiences for Teachers and Students project.  The project
              consists of a 4-week summer institute for teams of 1 teacher and 2 students
              from each of 15 high schools and an academic year program.  The participants
              are introduced to a research project in the field of molecular biology and
              bioinformatics.  During the academic year participants are part of research
              courses established by their high schools, take part in the Waksman Challenge,
              an Internet-based research problem solving activity, and a series of research
              workshops with other students from their high schools.  The project encourages
              a more research-rich climate in high schools by establishing, supporting, and
              sustaining on-going relationships among research scientists and the
              participating teachers and students.
