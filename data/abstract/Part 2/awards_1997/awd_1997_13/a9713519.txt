Abstract    :
               Residual stresses are the main cause of unwanted warpage observed in injection
              molded parts.  The objective of this research is to develop new technology for
              eliminating flow induced birefringence and minimizing thermally induced
              stresses due to cooling.  This objective will be accomplished by rapidly
              heating the mold surface so that the melt can fill the cavity isothermally and
              yet be processed within the normal injection molding cycle time.    The outcome
              of this research could eliminate the flow induced stresses in injection molded
              parts.  The inverse design optimization technique is very promising technique
              to obtain an optimally prescribed temporal profile of the mold surface
              temperature and provide better knowledge about the residual stress.   This
              project will greatly enhance applications in molding high-precision parts
              requiring absolute dimensional stability. The results of these studies are
              expected to ultimately lead to the development of an innovative cost-effective
              method of producing injection molded parts.
