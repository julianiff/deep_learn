Abstract    :
                    9713983  Tubbesing  This award provides partial support for the Sixth
              National  Conference on Earthquake Engineering.  The conference will be  held
              in Seattle, Washington and will provide an opportunity for  researchers and
              professional practitioners, in all disciplines in  the earthquake field, to
              come together and exchange research  results, design practices, and
              organizational and policy  perspectives on earthquake preparedness, mitigation
              and recovery.   In addition, future research needs in the field will also be 
              discussed.  The conference proceedings provide a valuable  repository of
              information critical to the advancement of  earthquake engineering.  ***
