Abstract    :
              The United States leads other industrialized nations in per capita fire losses. 
              Fires cost the American economy on the order of $128 billion per year, in
              addition to thousands of human casualties.  Of this amount, more than $20
              billion is spent on fire protection features for new buildings.  Over the past
              thirty years, researchers have developed promising new methods for designing
              fire safety in buildings.  And there is ample evidence these new approaches
              stand to yield vast benefits in the form of more con-effective fire protection
              in buildings of all kinds.  Unfortunately, few of these new research results
              are being used on a day-to-day basis by designers or regulatory authorities. 
              The purpose of this Second Conference on Fire Safety Design in the 21st Century
              is to review the results of the last conference in the light of experience that
              has transpired since that time; to review identified strategies for shaping the
              future of applied fire research results and design practices; to make
              recommendations for future change and to widely disseminate the results of the
              conference.  Conference attendees will include participants having perspectives
              representing all facets which are involved in or affected by advanced fire
              protection engineering design and regulatory practices.
