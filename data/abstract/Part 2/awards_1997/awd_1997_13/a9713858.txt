               Title: Atmospheric Trace Constituents and Global Climate    This grant is for
              continuation of research on the development of the climate chemistry model to
              be integrated into the climate system model. The topics of focus are 1) GCM
              simulations of the climatic effect of observed changes in atmospheric 03, 2)
              Effects of climate and climate change on the distribution of UV-B flux in the
              troposphere, 3) Diagnoses of the systematic biases of GCM simulated large scale
              climate relevant to atmospheric chemistry, and 4) GCM study of indirect effect
              of sulfate aerosols.    This research will enhance the capability of the
              climate system model, which in turn will enhance the national capability of
              climate prediction.
