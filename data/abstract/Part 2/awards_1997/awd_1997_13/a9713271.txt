Abstract    :
                Magnetic reconnection underlies important phenomena in nature in a broad range
              environment, including solar flares, magnetospheric substorms and disruptions
              in laboratory fusion experiments.  The topological change in the magnetic field
              which occurs during magnetic reconnection requires a breaking of the ideal MHD
              frozen flux constraint.  The present evidence is that collisionless magnetic
              reconnection can only be understood in the context of a full 3-D system.   
              Given the understanding of the basic physics issues controlling collisionless
              magnetic reconnection and the numerical tools which are available, the time is
              ripe to finally solve important  magnetic reconnection problems.  The proposal
              will outline an ambitious analytical and computational program to understand
              collisionless magnetic reconnection in a 3-D system.  The role of electron
              versus ion dynamics in controlling the rate of reconnection, the role of
              turbulence in breaking up the electron and ion current layers and finally the
              branching ratio of energy flow from the magnetic field into electrons and ions
              will be explored.  Comparisons will be made to ongoing and past laboratory
              reconnection experiments as well as satellite observations in the
              magnetosphere.
