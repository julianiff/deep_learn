Abstract    :
              9713052  Chung    Past research has demonstrated that a major role of boron in 
              ductilizing intermetallic alloys, such as Ni3Al, is to  suppress
              moisture-induced embrittlement.  It is generally  agreed that the embrittlement
              arises from the diffusion of  atomic hydrogen to the crack tip and that the
              atomic  hydrogen is produced from the chemical reaction between the  water
              vapor and the freshly exposed intermetallic surfaces.  The mechanism by which
              the boron suppresses the  embrittlement process has not been explored in
              detail.  This  project examines three physical and chemical effects of  boron
              on the surface reactivity of single crystal Ni3(Al,Ti)  surfaces towards water
              vapor, viz. (1) physical site  blocking; (2) formation of surface hydroxyls in
              the presence  of oxygen; and (3) modification of the relative rates of 
              hydrogen desorption and surface diffusion.  To understand a  recent surprising
              finding that boron-doped Ni3Al is less  ductile than boron-free Ni3Al in dry
              hydrogen, the  dissociation of hydrogen on Ni3(Al,Ti) surfaces is 
              investigated.  These studies are performed in situ as a  function of boron
              surface concentration and temperature  using primarily x-ray photoemission and
              thermal desorption  on single crystal Ni3(Al,Ti) (100) and (111) surfaces. 
              Controlled dosing of boron is accomplished using a solid-  state, low-energy
              boron ion source.  %%%  Nickel aluminide, Ni3Al, belongs to a class of
              aluminum-  based intermetallics that are potentially valuable for high 
              temperature structural applications.  This work assists in  understanding
              factors affecting the ductility of these  alloys.  ***
