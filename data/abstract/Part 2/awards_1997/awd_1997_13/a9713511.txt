Abstract    :
              9713511  Mulchandani  This project is to take advantage of the ability of taxol,
               and its active analogs and metabolites, to bind reversibly  to tubulin and
              promote its polymerization.  This capability  of taxol is to be used to develop
              a biosensor for the  measurement of the total anti-cancer activity of taxol in 
              different analyte samples.  It is to be demonstrated that  such a biosensor
              will be more specific, sensitive, precise,  rapid, cheaper, and easier to
              operate than presently used  techniques for measuring taxol.  ***
