Abstract    :
               This research project is aimed to develop a novel 3-D surface contouring system
              which can be used for industrial inspection and reverse engineering purposes. 
              The system is based on the full-field fringe projection technique, with a
              digital fringe projection system for rapid, automated surface contouring.  The
              planned research tasks include: digital fringe creation and projection,
              adaptive fringe projection, phase-shifting and fringe-ordering, calibration and
              error compensation, and on-the-object error mapping.  The technology goal is to
              enable high-accuracy, high-resolution contouring with abilities for fast and
              accurate location of defects.   There are many challenging issues in the
              proposed development, adaptation and integration of novel technology components
              for a 3-D surface contouring system.  The system, if successfully developed,
              has many advantages compared with the coordinate measuring machines and
              mechanical checking fixtures presently used in the automotive, aerospace,
              semiconductor, and other industries.
