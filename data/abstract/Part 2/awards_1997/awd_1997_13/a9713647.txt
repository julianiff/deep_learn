Abstract    :
               The goal of this research is to develop systematic algorithms and techniques
              for rapidly searching an optimal or near optimal solution of a resource
              allocation problem.  The research method, the Nested Partitions (NP) method,
              will be extended and tested to solve resource allocation problems encountered
              by industry partners.  Many resource allocation problems such as facility
              planning, job scheduling, pollution control, and portfolio management can be
              modeled as discrete stochastic optimization problems.  Owing to the complexity
              inherent in these systems, the design of allocation and scheduling policies can
              be a formidable task.  One key issue is the combinatorial explosion of
              alternatives normally leading to NP-complete optimization problems.  Beyond
              "toy problems", computational complexity is an obstacle faced by even the most
              elegant and effective approaches developed for solving realistic problems.  In
              the case of dynamic systems, the situation is exacerbated by the added elements
              of uncertainty, which further complicate such problems.    It is expected that
              this development will exert both a practical and theoretical impact in the area
              of complex system design, control, evaluation and optimization.  This research
              will allow the designer or manager to examine a large solution space to produce
              systems with predictable behavior which would prove to be cost effective and
              improve the quality of the systems.  The research development will also provide
              a framework for solving many other stochastic optimization problems.
