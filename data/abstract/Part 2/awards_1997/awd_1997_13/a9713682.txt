Abstract    :
              9713682  Jaillet   This research investigates key aspects of real-time dynamic
              problems in logistics and transportation.  The goals of the research are to (1)
              systematically analyze and integrate the most promising paradigms/solution
              strategies for dealing with real-time vehicle routing and scheduling problems,
              (2) formulate adequate corresponding generic models, and (3) develop, analyze,
              and implement algorithms for solving them.  The focus of the research is on the
              rigorous mathematical analysis of canonical models which would capture the
              essence of this new class of problems.  A main theme of the methodology will be
              on the integration of a priori optimization, on-line strategy, distributed
              local heuristics, randomization, and Markov decision process.   Interest in the
              development of real-time and dynamic models of fleet operations and of fleet
              management systems which are responsive to change in demand, traffic network
              and other conditions is emerging in many industries and for a wide variety of
              applications.  Managing and making use of the vast quantities of real-time
              information made available by navigation technologies, satellite positioning
              systems, automatic vehicle identification systems and spatial GIS databases
              requires the development of new models and algorithms.  This research holds the
              potential for significant advances in both the theory and applications of such
              models and algorithms.
