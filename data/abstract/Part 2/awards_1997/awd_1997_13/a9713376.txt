Abstract    :
               This university-industry collaboration research project is aimed to discover
              the underlying principles for design of computer-controlled devices for the
              assistance of assembly workers in handling heavy-weight objects.  The research
              tasks include: understanding of common maneuvers to lift, move and transfer
              loads; design of human assist devices; adaptive control of human-machine
              system; computer hardware and software design; and overall system performance
              evaluation.    The project is unique and innovative in the study of
              human-machine interface and the development of a computer-controlled device
              including this interface.  The research is academically challenging and is
              likely to lead to an effective solution for work-related back injury problems
              when handling heavy loads.
