Abstract    :
              This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to Vanderbilt   University
              supports the research of Professor Sandra J. Rosenthal.  The   theme of the
              research is the development of time-resolved scanning   tunneling microscopy
              for the study of charge migration in novel optical   and electronic materials. 
              The initial material being studied is   self-assembled monolayers composed of
              oligothiophene derivatives.    Oligomers consisting of different numbers of the
              thiophene monomer are   synthesized and the degree to which their ability to
              form ordered   monolayers depends upon chain length explored with scanning
              probe   microscopy.  The oligothiophene systems are ideal candidates to be  
              incorporated into a molecular transmission line to be used to demonstrate  
              simultaneous picosecond time resolution and molecular spatial resolution   of a
              time-resolved scanning tunneling microscope in the future.    The research is a
              crucial step in a long-term research program for direct   observation of both
              structure and function in novel materials, providing   the information
              necessary to tailor new materials designed for specific   device applications. 
              The ability to design new conducting materials   contributes to advances in the
              electronics industry.
