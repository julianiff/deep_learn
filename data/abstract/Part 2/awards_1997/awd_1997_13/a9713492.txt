Abstract    :
                This is a project to develop a model that specifies and forecasts  the
              conditions of the magnetospheric bow shock, magnetosheath,  magnetosphere, and
              ionosphere for given upstream solar wind  conditions.  The study extends work
              currently being funded under  the High Performance Computing and Communication
              (HPCC) program.   While this code is utilizing advanced numerical schemes to
              achieve  the best efficiency and accuracy, additional work is needed to  apply
              it to space weather objectives.  The effort consists of three  major
              components.  First, realistic physical parameters and  boundary conditions will
              be used to guide the model development.   Second, the physical understanding of
              space weather events will be  used to develop other theoretical models.  And
              third, the  investigators will compare the model output with observations for 
              specific space weather events.  The end product of the project is  a global MHD
              simulation code able to both specify and forecast the  state of the near-Earth
              space environment.
