              PROJECT SUMMARY    The interior ice sheets of the continent of Antarctica have
              always  been assumed to be devoid of indigenous organisms. While plants, 
              protozoa, and bacteria are present at the fringes of the continent,  the
              combination of low temperatures, long periods of darkness, and  the absence of
              liquid water make the interior extremely hostile to  life. However, recent
              examination of snow from the South Pole  indicates the presence of microbes
              which contain DNA and  photosynthetic pigments. Snow samples were collected at
              South Pole  station in January 1997 and flown immediately to the Crary Lab at 
              McMurdo Base. Examination of snowmelt using epifluorescence  microscopy showed
              the presence of rod shaped particles approximately  1 X 2.5 um in size and a
              concentration of 130 (sd=64) cells per ml.  The particles fluoresced orange
              under blue excitation light and  reddish-orange under green excitation,
              indicating the presence of  phycobiliproteins and chlorophyll. These
              fluorescence signatures  combined with the particles' shape suggests that they
              are  cyanobacteria. Subsequent analysis using fluorescent DNA stains and 
              scanning electron microscopy confirmed the presence of DNA  containing microbes
              identical in shape to the autofluorescing  particles seen with epifluorescent
              microscopy. Further research will  confirm whether these microbes are
              indigenous to the Antarctic  interior and investigate their biology and
              ecology. The discovery of  organisms capable of survival in interior Antarctica
              would provide  us with new insight into the adaptability of life. Their 
              biomolecules and metabolism must be unique and could have great  value for
              molecular engineering research.
