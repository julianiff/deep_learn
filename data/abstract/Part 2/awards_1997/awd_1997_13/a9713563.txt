Abstract    :
              The PI will perform theoretical investigations of HF-induced plasma turbulence
              in the ionosphere, dealing with:  (1) improving fundamental physical
              descriptions included in simulation codes for treating HF induced Langmuir
              turbulence, and (2) applying the Langmuir turbulence theory to the prediction
              of hot electrons and airglow, the excitation of Langmuir turbulence by beat
              wave excitation, simultaneously employing two heater frequencies differing by a
              local ionospheric plasma frequency, the simulation of probe signatures on a
              wounding rocket traversing the HF induced turbulent region, analysis of the
              excitation of the two-plasmon decay instability and stimulated Raman scattering
              in the ionosphere, and mesoscale phenomena involving the self-consistent
              propagation of heater wave in its induced turbulence and modified density
              profile.
