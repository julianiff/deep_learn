Abstract    :
                  The investigators will use a global circulation model of the  Earth's
              magnetosphere to study key aspects of substorms and their  global consequences.
               The methodology is to use solar wind data as  input to the simulation model
              and critically compare the results  with observations in the magnetosphere and
              ionosphere.  By  combining simulation results with observational data, the 
              investigators will overcome the limited spatial and temporal  resolution of
              observations and be able to produce accurate, high  resolution synoptic maps of
              the magnetosphere and ionosphere.  With  these maps the investigators will
              study key issues of substorm  research, such as the detailed topology of
              substorm current systems  and the timing of substorm signatures.  The research
              will lead to  a better understanding of geomagnetic activity and substorms and 
              aid in the development of improved space weather predictions.
