Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to develop a storm-time correction map that will improve the
              ability of existing models to specify the variations in ionospheric density
              associated with magnetic storms.  During a geomagnetic storm, the ionosphere
              can be severely altered causing disruptions to communication and navigation
              systems.  This project takes advantage of the new understanding of the response
              of the upper atmosphere to geomagnetic storms to develop a correction map for
              the mid and high latitude ionosphere.  Two approaches are planned.  The first
              involves the use of a physically-based Coupled Thermosphere Ionopshere Model,
              the second involves capturing the essential physics in an empirical
              description.  The study will determine the most successful prescription for
              magnetospheric forcing of the upper atmosphere and will develop a measure of
              accuracy of prediction.
