Abstract    :
              DMI-9713699  Sampath  This research is to investigate the physical vapor
              deposition (PVD) source and to increase the understanding of the vapor source
              and process monitoring for  the Air to Vacuum to Air (AVA) high throughput
              vacuum deposition of thin films process.  The research focus involves modeling
              both the vapor source flux uniformity and on uniform source charge depletion to
              gain an increased understanding.  The vapor source control strategy will also
              be studied to understand in-situ sensor requirements for process control. 
              These quantitative models will be experimentally verified through the
              deposition and study of semiconductor thin films for thin film devices and
              photovoltaics. This research in understanding of the PVD vapor source has
              potential applications in a large number of thin film industries, including
              flat panel display and photovoltaic industries.  In addition, the proposed
              research on improved film uniformity and uniform charge depletion and in-situ
              temperature measurement would have direct benefits to many vacuum deposition
              industries.  This is especially true for bigger wafer size in the future.
