Abstract    :
              9713567   Sillman    The project investigates the chemistry of secondary species
              associated with ozone formation, specifically total reactive nitrogen compounds
              (NOy), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and associated organic nitrates, hydrogen
              peroxide and organic peroxides. These chemical species have been measured
              during a number of recent field measurement campaigns and for planned future
              campaigns in the eastern U.S., including the Middle Tennesee Ozone Study, the
              NARSTO study in the northeastern U.S. corridor, and the Ozone Photochemistry
              and Climatology Experiment in Peliston, MI.  The field data will serve as input
              into the photochemical models to be developed and evaluated for this project.  
              Model results will be compared with measured values for ratios of key organic
              peroxide compounds, along with other chemical indicators for ozone, NOx and
              reactive organic hydrocarbons (ROG).  Special emphasis will be placed on
              atmospheric removal rates for peroxides and nitric acid in model calculations,
              and on recent proposed changes and uncertainties in organic peroxide chemistry.
              An attempt will be made to derive atmospheric removal rates for peroxides and
              nitric acid by comparing measurements with different model scenarios.
              Implications for the use of peroxides as ozone-NOx-ROG indicators will be
              investigated.   Results from this modeling project will provide rigorous and
              detailed evaluations of ozone formation processes occurring in the lower
              troposphere over urban and rural continental areas of the northeastern U.S.
