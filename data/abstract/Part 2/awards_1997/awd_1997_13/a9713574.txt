Abstract    :
              This project will combine data from the DMSP and NOAA polar  orbiting spacecraft
              from 1984 - 1997 to develop and compute indices  representing magnetotail
              stretching, the open/closed boundary  location and shape, and the enclosed open
              magnetic flux.  Automated  techniques based on neural nets will be used to
              process the vast  amounts of data to develop a database containing information
              on the  magnetospheric state.  This will enable statistical and prediciton 
              filter studies as well as provide general availability of the  indices for
              community use.  The investigators will utilize the  database for correlation
              and prediction filter studies.
