Abstract    :
              9713932  Jawahir  The awarded research is aimed at developing a comprehensive
              predictive model for turning operations. Quantitative experiments will be
              conducted to classify various groups of chip flow, curl mechanisms, and
              breaking mechanisms for the development of appropriate relationships for
              generic turning modeling.  Relationships for chip-side and back-flow mechanisms
              will be developed using fracture mechanics for 3-D chip breaking, as well as
              techniques for quantifying the effects of tool-chip tribological interactions.
              The results will be used to develop a predictive model which has a wide range
              of variability to represent a large spectrum of conditions.  Besides being
              useful to the development of applied machinability for machining systems, this
              model will enable the design of innovative chip-groove geometries for cutters
              used in turning operations.  This award could lead to a fundamental
              understanding of the complex tool-chip interactions in turning with grooved
              tools and the development of an accurate model for predicting 3-D chip flow,
              curl and breaking processes as well as the corresponding stresses, strains and
              temperatures.  The study is also practically important, especially for total
              chip control in uninterrupted automated machining.
