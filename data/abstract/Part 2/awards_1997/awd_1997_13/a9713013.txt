Abstract    :
                9713013  Ripley    The Academy for Educational Development, working in
              association with the Association of Science-Technology Centers, is conducting
              activities necessary in planning a clearinghouse that would provide information
              and support to museums striving to provide greater and easier access to
              visitors with disabilities.  During the planning phase, the applicants will:   
              * identify the unmet access, information and educational needs of children and
              youth with disabilities as they relate to the operations and services of
              science-rich museums nationwide;  * identify exemplary facilities, exhibits,
              materials, and outreach and programming efforts in the museum world that are
              currently meeting needs in this regard; and  * identify the most appropriate
              and feasible strategies through which science museums and similar facilities
              can attract and more fully respond to the needs of visitors with disabilities. 
                Toward the end of this effort, the project will develop and field-test a
              panel and workshop on accessibility at the ASTC 1997 conference.   The results
              of the surveys and the prototype workshop will serve as the foundation for
              design of a more comprehensive and sustainable effort to support accessibility
              in museums.
