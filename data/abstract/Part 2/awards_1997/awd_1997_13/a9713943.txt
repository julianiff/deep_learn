Abstract    :
              9713943  Riffle  This project is an interdisciplinary plan for engineering 
              carbon fiber reinforced vinyl ester composites to meet the  rigorous
              environmental durability needs for infrastructure.  Composite materials will be
              designed specifically to  withstand long-term moisture and UV exposure based on
              both  chemical constituents and composite construction,  particularly
              fiber-matrix interface design.  The project  encompasses modified resin and
              composite development,  hygrothermal and ultraviolet laboratory exposure, 
              environmental field testing, and residual mechanical  property analyses as a
              function of exposure.  This is the  first comprehensive study of an important
              class of candidate  materials for infrastructural uses where the constituent 
              chemistry, the environmental exposure, and the mechanics of  degradation are
              linked.  NIST will provide state-of-the-art  ultraviolet testing facilities and
              expertise for both the  laboratory and field experiments in collaboration with
              the  project.  The Tom's Creek Bridge project, a vinyl  ester/carbon/glass
              vehicular bridge constructed in  Blacksburg, VA  during the summer of 1997,
              will be leveraged  as a field-testing site.  The work will also be done in 
              close collaboration with major resin suppliers to insure  that modifications
              under consideration have potential for  large volume production, and to insure
              that technology is  transferred to appropriate producers efficiently.    The
              experimental plan is to design and fabricate composites,  age materials, and
              characterize damage.  ***
