Abstract    :
               This research project is to investigate and develop a novel hybrid technology,
              a combination of electrostatic spray coating (ESC) of cubic boron nitride (cBN)
              powder and chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) of titanium nitride (TiN) phase in
              the cBN matrix, a revolutionary method for the fabrication of cBN:TiN composite
              coated cutting tool inserts.  The research program will be executed in
              collaboration between the University and an industrial partner.  This
              proof-of-concept research effort will provide a unique way to achieve maximum
              concentration of cBN in cBN-TiN composite layer by maintaining good properties
              relevant to cutting tool application.     The success of the fundamental study
              and applied technological developments will not only be instrumental in the
              development of the cBN coated tool product but will lead to innovative
              products.
