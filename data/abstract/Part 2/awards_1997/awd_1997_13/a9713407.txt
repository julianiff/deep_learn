Abstract    :
                This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project involves use   of
              newly developed instrumentation to measure the flux of dimethylsulfide   (DMS)
              from seawater to the atmosphere.  Preliminary work off a pier are   the first
              for DMS using the atmospheric profile in the lower boundary   layer of the
              marine atmosphere. An at-sea test in July 1997 represents a   unique and
              short-term opportunity to conduct measurements of gas flux on a   cruise
              dedicated to that task. This project will allow the PI to transfer   his
              technique for measuring DMS profiles to a remotely-operated catamaran,  
              allowing him to relate DMS flux with concomitant investigations of surface  
              chemistry and physics by other investigators on the cruise. The direct  
              comparison of these independent methods of estimating flux represents a   test
              of thin layer transfer models and may provide insight into more   general
              questions of gas exchange.
