Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9713936  HARTKOPF      This award provides funding for the
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center at Carnegie Mellon entitled
              "Center for Building Performance and Diagnostics."  This Center conducts
              research, development and demonstrations to increase the quality of commercial
              buildings and integrated building systems, while improving performance and
              energy effectiveness.  Research goals for the Center include conceptualization
              and prototypes of high-performance products and integrated assemblies,
              demonstration of innovative technologies and retrofit techniques using the
              Intelligent Workplace laboratory, state-of-the-art demonstration projects,
              improved delivery of high-performance buildings, and improved educational
              programs on systems integration for total building performance.
