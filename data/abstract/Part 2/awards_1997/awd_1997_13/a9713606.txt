Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  SOLGARRD  EEC-9713606    This award is for a planning meeting to
              determine the feasibility and visibility of the  University of California-Davis
              to become a research site of the University of California-Berkeley
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Microsensors and Actuators.
               The   University of California-Davis Microphotonics Laboratory's research and
              resources would be complementary and synergistic with the I/UCRC at Berkeley.  
               The research agenda proposed for industrial support and additions to the UC
              Berkeley I/UCRC addresses:  1.)   High Precision Integrated Optical Scanners,
              2.) Fiber-Optic Switches for Wavelength-Division-Multiplexed Optical
              Communication Networks and RF-Photonics, 3.) Corner Cube Reflectors for Low
              Power Communication, 4.) Optoelectronic Packaging using Silicon
              Surface-Micromachined Alignment Mirrors, 5.) Batch-Fabricated, Magnetically
              Actuated Microstructures, 6.) Femosecond-Laser-Pulse Shaping, 7.) Evanescently
              Coupled Microphotonic Devices and Systems, 8.) Studies of Optomechanical
              Effects in Polymeric Thin Films, 9.) Studies of Friction and Surface Forces in
              MEMS.
