Abstract    :
              9713711  Fischer  A study of the tribochemical polishing of silicon will be 
              undertaken.  The objective is to find a more environmentally  acceptable
              polishing medium than the currently used chromium  oxide and to improve the
              tribochemical polishing of surfaces  consisting of different materials
              deposited on silicon  wafers, such as they are encountered in the fabrication
              of  integrated circuits.  The study will involve a close  examination of the
              polishing mechanisms involving chromium  oxide and the related
              friction-activated surface reactions  as well as a study of the chemical
              characteristics of the  polishing fluids and their effect on polishing
              performance.  ***
