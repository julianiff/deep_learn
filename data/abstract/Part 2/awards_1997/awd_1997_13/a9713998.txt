Abstract    :
              ***  CMS-9713998  Panoskaltsis      An interdisciplinary program will study the
              fabrication  and mechanical properties of shape memory alloys (SMA) with 
              emphasis on thin films.  Such films have applications to 
              microelectromechanical systems (MEMS); SMA have been shown  to be the actuation
              method with the largest energy density  when compared to other micro actuation
              methods.  Thus, the  development of rational design procedures for SMA 
              microactuators is needed if the potential of SMA in MEMS is  to be realized. 
              To develop such a design procedure we  propose the following five major tasks: 
                      Task 1: Development of measurement methods for thin             film
              SMA.             Task 2: Development of processing/property            
              relationship for thin film SMA.     Task 3: Development of constitutive
              relations for SMA.     Task 4: Development of design tools and material data   
                       base.                                              We seek to provide
              a sound mechanics base for SMA  actuators MEMS devices. In addition, we seek to
              provide a  sound materials science base relating processing parameters  to SMA
              microstructures and SNM microstructures to mechanical  behavior. Our overall
              aim is to develop complete design  tools for the use of SMA in MEMS devices.***
