Abstract    :
                      ECS-9713443    C. L. Tang    This proposal is seeking funding to
              purchase a diode-pumped Nd: YVO4  laser for the research on solid-state broadly
              tunable femtosecond optical parametric oscillators that has been supported by 
              NSF under award ECS-9705704.
