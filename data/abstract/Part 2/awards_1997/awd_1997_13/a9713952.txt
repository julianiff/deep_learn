Abstract    :
              This research project deals with electronic gun control of  smart materials and
              structures. Smart materials such as  piezoelectrics,  magnetostrictives, and
              electrostrictives  are finding increased use in modern design because of the 
              direct coupling they provide between mechanical energy and  electrical energy.
              Upon application of a stress to  piezoelectric material an electric field is
              generated in the  material, and when an electric field is applied to the 
              material it changes dimensions. This makes piezoelectric  materials ideal for
              use in compact electromechanical  actuators. The electric gun control is
              accomplished by  critically examining the materials, structural modeling, and 
              the system itself. This includes characterizing the electron-  material
              interactions that occur when the electrons from the  electron gun strike the
              piezoelectric material. Advances in  structural modeling and system design are
              possible since an  elimination of the need for static electrodes in smart 
              structures gives the system designer a lever of latitude in  structural design
              and control algorithm selection that has  not been seen before. Successful
              realization of the electron-  gun control concept leads to significant
              technological  advances and industry applications in a wide range of 
              disciplines ranging from noise suppression to medical  imaging.
