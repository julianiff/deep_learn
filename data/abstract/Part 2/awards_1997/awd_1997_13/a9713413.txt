Abstract    :
              1997 AMS Summer Research Institute on "Differential Geometry and Control"    The
              American Mathematical Society's long-standing series of three-week long  summer
              research institutes bring together between 100 and 300  mathematicians actively
              working in a particular field of mathematical  research. Emphasis is placed on
              instruction and information exchange at a  very high level, including lectures
              by distinguished mathematicians in  related fields designed to promote
              interaction between participants while  broadening their mathematical
              perspectives.    Members of the Organizing Committee for the 1997 Summer
              Research Institute  are:    Professor Hector J. Sussmann, Rutgers University
              (Chair)  Professor Henry Hermes, University of Colorado at Boulder (Co-chair) 
              Professor Guillermo S. Ferreyra, Louisiana State University  Professor Robert
              B. Gardner, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill    The Institute will
              be held at Boulder, Colorado, on the campus of the  University of Colorado
              between June 29 and July 19, 1997. Staff of the  American Mathematical Society
              will provide administrative support for the  conference.
