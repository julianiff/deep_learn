Abstract    :
              This award in the Mars-Rock Special Research Opportunity activity   supports
              study of carbon-14 abundances in martian meteorites by Dr. Greg   H. Rau of the
              Institute of Marine Sciences, University of California,   Santa Cruz.  The
              project is funded by the Office of Polar Programs, the   Chemistry Division,
              and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.    Carbon isotopic
              measurements (C-13/C-12 ratio and C-14 concentration)   will be conducted on
              carbon collected from the ALH84001 meteorite using   discrete inorganic and
              organic carbon extraction techniques.  The goal of   the project is to gain a
              better understanding of the sources and possible   martian biogenicity of
              carbon contained in the meteorite.  The work will   be conducted as part of a
              collaborative research project based at   NASA-Ames Research Center where
              individual acid, UV-laser ablation, and   stepped heating extractions will be
              performed on AHL84001 samples and   terrestrial analogs.  Isotopic analysis
              will be performed on the carbon   dioxide released from these extraction
              fractions.  The mass and isotopic   abundances within the organic and inorganic
              fractions will be determined,   as well as the degree of terrestrial
              contamination of each fraction, and   the isotopic carbon ratio of both the
              meteorite organic and inorganic   carbon.  The results will be interpreted in
              the context of Martian   geology and climate.  It is likely that terrestrial
              carbon contamination   may have influenced the meteorite's organic carbon
              concentration, and   this will be considered in order to accurately infer
              Martian   organic/inorganic carbon isotope abundances, fractionations, and
              organic   carbon formation process.  Carbon in planetary samples may be present
              in inorganic forms or may have   been modified by biological activity.  As a
              result of either physical or   biological forces, the isotopic composition of
              carbon in the sample may   have been altered to provide a distinctive
              `signature.`  This research   brings together a unique combination of carbon
              isotope extertise from   NASA-Ames, the University of California, and the
              Lawrence Livermore   National Laboratory to investigate both terrestrial and
              meteorite   samples.  The results will aid in determining whether or not the
              evidence   from martian meteorite ALH84001 is consistent with biological
              activity.
