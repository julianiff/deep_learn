Abstract    :
               Polymer coatings are being used in a growing range of applications, including
              passivation, wear, and chemical resistance. The primary technical challenge in
              the practical use of nanocomposite coatings is achievement of uniform
              dispersions of the nanoparticulates within the polymer matrix. The research
              objectives are:  (1) develop an understanding of the complex nanoscale
              microstructural development in both the matrix and the overall composite as a
              function of reinforcement composition, dispersion/distribution, loading,
              morphology and surface chemistry as well as spray parameters; (2) understand
              the role of particulate surface chemistry in improving the dispersion of the
              reinforcement, the moisture and gas permeability, and the corrosion resistance;
              (3) optimize dispersion of the reinforcing phase within the composite coatings
              through manipulation of matrix and particle properties and deposition
              parameters, including matrix composition, particulate surface chemistry and
              morphology, and spray parameters; and (4) develop a property database of the
              effects of reinforcement content and surface chemistry, spray parameters and
              matrix structure on the corrosion/permeability properties.   The scratch
              resistance and permeability can both be improved significantly through the
              addition of nanoparticulate ceramic reinforcements to the polymer matrix from
              the outcomes of the research activities.  This would then be used to develop
              optimized composite coatings suitable for use as commercial corrosion and
              moisture barriers.
