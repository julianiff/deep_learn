Abstract    :
              9713335  Swan  Integrated  analysis,  design, and  production  methods  are 
              developed for new generations of composites with continuous,  three-dimensional
               fiber reinforcing geometries.  Continuous  three-dimensional reinforcing
              geometries (textiles) hold the  possibility  of  providing  new  generations 
              of  FRPs  with  dramatically enhanced mechanical performing characteristics. 
              Systematic analysis and optimization techniques are employed  to  determine 
              the  topology of fibrous textile  in  polymer  matrix composites which can
              maximize their three-dimensional  stiffness and strength performance
              characteristics.      ***
