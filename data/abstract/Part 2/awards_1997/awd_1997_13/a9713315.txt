Abstract    :
              The Unidata Program Center (UPC) at the University Corporation for Atmospheric
              Research enables academic institutions to acquire real-time atmospheric data
              and employ sophisticated software to use them.  UPC offers support services
              that encompass training, troubleshooting, documentation, and metadata, as well
              as workshops, electronic mailing lists, and Web pages that stimulate
              community-wide dialogues.  UPC continues to develop software for improved
              ease-of-use and greater compatibility with more data access and advocating free
              and open data exchange.  Such compatibility entails, beyond adapting decoders
              and applications to analyze and display the data, development of the Internet
              Data Distribution system to incoporate new sources; to handle higher data
              rates; to adjust itself automatically to variations in user demands; to adapt
              dynamically to Internet performance variations; and to exploit networking
              advances, such as multicast protocols.
