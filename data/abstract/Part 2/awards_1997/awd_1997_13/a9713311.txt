Abstract    :
                        Abstract  Horn    This proposal requests partial support for a joint
              meeting of the Southeastern-Atlantic Region and the Midwest Conferences on
              Differential Equations to be held at Vanderbilt University on November 7-9,
              1997.  These joint meetings occur at five year intervals and rotate among the
              campuses of the participating institutions.  Particular emphasis is given to
              supporting the participation of women, minorities, and young investigators, and
              one of the primary goals is to fund advanced graduate students and recent PhDs,
              allowing them to present their own research and interact with the broader
              mathematical community.
