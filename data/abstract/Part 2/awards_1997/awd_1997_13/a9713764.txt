Abstract    :
              9713764  Ostoja-Starzewski  The multiscale mechanics of paper treated as a
              randomly  structured materials is investigated under this project. The  scales
              involved are from the level of a fiber network  comprising hundreds, or
              thousands, of cellulose fibers  (micron or millimeter scale) to an effective
              continuum level  (centimeters or meters scale). Optical and confocal 
              microscopy observations and measurements of fiber network  micromechanics,
              biaxial tensile testing, and uniaxial  tensile testing over a range of scales
              from 2 millimeters to  2 meters are made. These experiments are used as a basis
              for  verification of computational micromechanics modeling of  fiber networks,
              represented as large systems of randomly  connected small beams, as well as for
              development of scale-  dependent stochastic constitutive laws of paper. The
              results  of this program are synthesized into ready-to-use formulas,  maps, and
              software modules that could be used by the paper  industry, researchers, and
              students.  ***
