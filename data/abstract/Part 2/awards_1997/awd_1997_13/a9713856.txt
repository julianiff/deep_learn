Abstract    :
              9713856  Linderman  The responses of cells are governed to a large extent by the
               binding of ligands to cell surface receptors and the signal  transduction
              steps that follow.  Multiple ligands which bind  to the same receptors often
              show differences in their  abilities to elict cellular responses despite
              equivalent  occupancy of receptors (i.e. there are differences in ligand 
              efficacy).  An estimated 80% of all signaling receptors  transmit their signal
              through guanine nucleotide binding  proteins (G-proteins).  A quantitative
              understanding of the  determinants of ligand efficacy in G-protein coupled 
              receptor systems is thus vital to biotechnological  applications such as
              rational drug design and cell and  tissue engineering.  The objective of this
              project is to use  and integrated engineering/cell biology approach to 
              demonstrate that three critical parameters determining  ligand efficacy and
              cellular responses in G-protein couple  receptor systems are: (a) the rate of
              transition between  receptor states; (b) the lifetime of an individual 
              receptor/ligand complex; and (c) the extent of receptor/G-  protein
              precoupling.  The primary methods to be used are  flow cytometry and
              mathematical modeling.  ***
