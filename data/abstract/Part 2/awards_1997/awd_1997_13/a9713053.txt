              providing structure and guidance in the organizing and evaluating of the
              research program.    The evaluator is responsible for implementing the NSF

              developmental history in the form of annual historical profile updates, conduct
              annual written survey studies with the Center's faculty and sponsor
              organizations, conduct exit interviews of industrial sponsors terminating
              center affiliation.  The evaluator also attends semi-annual Industrial Advisory
              Board (IAB) meetings.
