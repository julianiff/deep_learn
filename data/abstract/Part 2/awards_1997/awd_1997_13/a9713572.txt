Abstract    :
              Abstract  ATM-9713572  DeGaetano, Arthur T.  Cornell University  Title: An
              Empirical and Dynamical Evaluation of the Interannual  Variability of East
              Coast Winter Storms    This proposal aims to understand the temporal
              variability of east  coast winter storms and identify the climatological
              mechanisms that  influence the frequency and severity of these storm systems, 
              AN  objective climatology of east coast winter storms will be developed  using
              automated procedure.  Frequency, year to year variability,  strength and
              possibly impacts of these storms will be studied.    Because the U.S. east
              coast is heavily populated, the successful  completion of this work could lead
              to large societal benefits.
