Abstract    :
              9713039  Fred Taylor  University of Florida    CISE Educational Innovation:
              Synergy: A CISE Learning Environment    This CISE Educational Innovation award,
              involving both the University of Florida and the University of Texas at El
              Paso, supports the development of a new activity-based learning environment
              called Synergy.  Synergy provides undergraduate students with the opportunity
              to engage in hands-on research-centric digital signal processing (DSP) studies
              within a simulated professional engineering framework.  A significant part of
              the project includes development of a new capstone laboratory which is designed
              to provide students with an experience which requires demonstrated unstructured
              problem solving skills, clear and concise communications, planning and
              scheduling discipline, Internet utilization, and personal accountability.   The
              laboratory is being developed with input from DSP projects from across areas of
              the institution including engineering, medicine, education, architecture,
              computer science, and others, and from industrial partners as well.
