Abstract    :
              This project will fund a Ph.D. student at Big Bear Solar Observatory to
              establish an automated early warning system of filament eruption.  A computer
              program, developed to automatically recognize the structure of filaments, will
              broadcast their disappearance to researchers via electronic mail.  Broadcast
              information will include the time of eruption and the coordinates and size of
              the filament.  The student will establish a filament index based on the list of
              filament eruptions recorded by the automated program.  This index will account
              for frequency of filament eruption, size of filament, and disk location, and
              will be compared with indices of geomagnetic activity.
