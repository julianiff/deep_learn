Abstract    :
              The American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) is conducting a project
              consisting of a sequence of three interconnected activities designed to enhance
              the quality of science, mathematics, engineering, and technological (SMET)
              education in community colleges.      Activity One.  Fall, 1997 Conference of
              Community College SMET Educators.  This is national meeting of representatives
              from groups interested in science and engineering advanced technological
              education, including principal investigators from current National Science
              Foundation (NSF) Advanced Technological Education (ATE) projects and centers,
              private and public sector leaders, and professional associations, among others
              concerned about such programs.    Activity Two.  A Case Study of the ATE
              Program.  This activity is a study of the four-year old NSF ATE program.  The
              study is looking at what has been accomplished through the program and its
              relationship with other stakeholders in the process (businesses, schools,
              four-year colleges and universities, and others).  The case study focuses on
              approximately ten projects.  A 100 to 150 page monograph is being produced
              which is being widely distributed throughout the community college community. 
              It is being used to shape Activity Three described below.      Activity Three. 
              Fall, 1998 Conference of Community College SMET Educators.  The purpose of this
              conference is to underscore and discuss the findings of the assessment
              conducted in Activity Two.  A conference report includes these recommendations
              and is being shared with conference participants and distributed to the larger
              community of SMET-interested audiences.  *
