              Title:                  Basic issues of the dynamics and radiation of capillary
              discharge plasmas    In this research, a combined theoretical and experimental
              program to elucidate the fundamental aspects of the dynamics of capillary
              discharge plasmas will  be performed..  An increased understanding of the
              mechanisms that lead to the remarkable uniformity of capillary discharge
              plasmas and their scaling laws could potentially revolutionize the was in which
              hot dense plasmas are generated.  Capillary discharges can lead to
              breakthroughs in many important areas including the development of table-top
              soft X-ray lasers, the development of incoherent extreme ultraviolet source for
              nanolithography and the channeling of high intensity laser pulses for compact
              accelerators and for the generation of very strong magnetic fields.
