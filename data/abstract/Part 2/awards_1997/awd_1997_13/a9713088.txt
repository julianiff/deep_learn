Abstract    :
                                            3  9713088  Storm    This grant provides support
              for speakers and graduate  students to attend the Gordon Research Conference on
               Corrosion to be held in New Hampshire, July 20-25, 1997.  This is the
              prototype Gordon Conference with a selection of  outstanding speakers and
              international participants covering  cutting edge activities related to the
              fundamentals of  oxidation and corrosion of metal alloys and ceramics. 
              Subjects include oxidation of nonmetallic materials,  residual stress and
              associated damage in oxide scales during  growth, problems of oxidation in
              titanium aluminide alloys,  applications of thermal barrier coatings and their
              failure  mechanisms, internal oxidation mechanisms in metal alloys,  and the
              high temperature corrosion resistance of chromia  scales.  Six countries are
              represented at the conference.  %%%  Application of advanced materials at
              elevated temperature  depends on the continued improvement of environment- 
              resistant coatings on materials.  This conference takes a  timely look at the
              fundamentals associated with this science  and technology.  ***
