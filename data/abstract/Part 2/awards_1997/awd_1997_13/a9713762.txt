Abstract    :
              9713762  Zikry  Greater understanding of and accurate predictive  capabilities
              of nanomicrostructurally induced inelastic  failure modes in artificially
              layered materials is obtained  by: (i) synthesis and processing of layered
              nanostructures  by laser physical vapor deposition and magnetron sputtering  to
              ascertain the effects of processing defects on material  failure; (ii)
              development of a three dimensional multiple-  slip crystal plasticity
              constitutive formulation that  accounts for the evolution of immobile and
              mobile  dislocation densities in the crack-tip region along film  interfaces
              and grain-boundaries in each layer; (iii) large-  scale three dimensional
              computational and experimental  investigation of dislocation pile-ups and slip-
               incompatibilities for a detailed investigation of  interfacial and
              transgranular crack growth as a function of  film interfaces, high angle
              grain-boundaries, lattice  mismatch strains, and nano grain-sizes; and (iv)
              novel in-  situ TEM and SEM measurements and computational analyses of  crack
              growth and void coalescence in layered nanocomposites,  and development of
              scaling methodologies for mechanical  testing. The realization of these
              advances significantly  contributes towards improved capabilities for
              developing  innovative processing and material synthesis techniques for  a new
              generation of epitaxially layered nanostructures for  optoelectronic and
              semiconductor devices.  ***
