Abstract    :
               This research project is to study and optimize the fatigue life for surfaces
              machined by superfinish hard turning.  This will be accomplished by:  (1)
              modeling the relationship between machining conditions, tool wear, surface
              integrity, and fatigue life of the superfinish hard turned surface, and (2)
              developing a methodology enabling optimal pre-stressing, through the optimal
              residual stress distribution generated by the best cutting conditions for
              fatigue life.  The research results could lead to the replacement of grinding
              and superfinishing by single-point machining, benefiting the manufacturing
              industries that make bearings, gears, cams, shafts, tools, dies, etc.   The
              research is fundamental and could lead to a significant improvement in the
              fatigue life of superfinish hard turned surfaces.  A major strength of the
              project is its strong industry participation and support.
