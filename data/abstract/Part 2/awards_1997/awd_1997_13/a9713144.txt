Abstract    :
              9713144  Ballance    A series of six focus groups will convene at the Spring,
              1997  meeting of the Materials Research Society (MRS) in San Francisco  from
              March 31 to April 3, 1997 to address issues of mutual  interest to the Society
              and to NSF's Division of Materials  Research, including the Division's merit
              review procedures,  research and education funding, and balance among funding
              modes.  The focus groups will reflect the distribution of MRS membership,  of
              which approximately one half is from academic institutions,  one fourth from
              industry, and one fourth from government  laboratories and private
              organizations. A summary of the  conclusions and recommendations of the focus
              groups will be  provided to NSF and published on the MRS World Wide Web site.
