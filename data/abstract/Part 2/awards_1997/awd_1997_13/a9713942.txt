Abstract    :
              9713942  Bryant  Initial studies have shown that micro-vibrations properly 
              applied to bodies in sliding contact can reduce their wear  by 50% or more.  In
              this follow-up study the basic  mechanisms involved will be studied and
              techniques will be  developed to optimize the effect using passively generated 
              vibrations for several target technologies, including  automotive and aircraft
              brakes as well as electrical  brushes.  It is expected that near the end of the
              study  subtle design changes can eventually be developed for  automotive brake
              systems which will enable passive  generation of vibrations that promote the
              vibration-induced  wear reduction without having any deleterious side effects 
              and that this could result in a very significant drop in  brake wear.  ***
