Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to develop a software package which, when interfaced to a
              time evolving ionospheric representation, will yield quantitative information
              about the growth and development of ionospheric irregularities at high
              latitudes.  The software package will interface descriptions of irregularity
              growth and decay with a time dependent ionospheric model.  As a proof of
              concept, the investigators will develop a module that describes the growth rate
              of the gradient drift instability in the high latitude ionosphere.  The
              distribution of irregularities and their time histories on specified magnetic
              flux tubes will be computed and graphically displayed.  These distributions
              will be compared with those obtained for scintillations measurements.  Future
              updates to this instability model will be relatively straightforward because
              the platform will be developed to have a modular interface to the instability
              model.  The overriding objective of this study is to demonstrate that adequate
              progress has been made in large-scale ionospheric modeling to the point that
              both gradients in plasma density and electric field structures are adequate to
              produce meaningful estimates of the lower limits to the gradient drift
              instability growth rate on a global scale.
