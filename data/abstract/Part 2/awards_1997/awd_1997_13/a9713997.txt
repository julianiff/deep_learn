Abstract    :
              9713997  Perdikaris  The influence of the microscale and concrete compressive
              strength  on the fracture energy per unit crack surface area will be  evaluated
              by studying the roughness characteristics of a fracture  surface, such as the
              surface roughness index, fractal dimension  and wavelength content.         The
              major objectives of this research are:    a)   to perform 3-point bending tests
              under CMOD control on    concrete beam specimens of three sizes with three
              maximum    aggregate sizes and three concrete compressive strengths and   
              determine the roughness characteristics of the fracture surfaces,    that is
              the roughness index, fractal dimension, and Fourier    amplitude spectra for
              each fracture surface    b)   to study the roughness characteristics of the
              fracture    surfaces and to evaluate their dependence on the maximum   
              aggregate size and concrete compressive strength and their    influence on the
              "load vs. load-point-displacement" response and    the specific fracture
              energy.    c)   to develop a micromechanics-based semi-empirical analysis,   
              wherein the apparent toughness will be calculated based on the    given
              roughness characteristics of the observed crack paths and    aggregate size.   
              This research program will be undertaken through a university-  state-industry
              collaboration.  The results will improve the  methods of specification and
              evaluation of the performance of  normal and high strength concrete resulting
              in more efficient  designs.
