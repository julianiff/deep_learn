Abstract    :
               This grant provides funding to develop a finite algorithm and forecasting
              procedure for the determination of optimal decisions in the context of a
              non-stationary model that accurately reflects a future characterized by
              technological change.  In particular, research will be directed toward
              establishing both existence of, and a algorithm to discover, a finite planning
              horizon guaranteed to yield an optimal policy choice for today's decisions. 
              For the forecasting function, a hierarchical model will be developed that
              simplifies the task of data forecasting by decomposing the system being modeled
              into elementary components, each assumed to exhibit costs that grow by a
              constant proportion over time.   Selection of a planning horizon for
              non-stationary models has been in the past based upon tradition or engineering
              judgement.  When the horizon is myopic, the resulting decisions taken can be
              short-sighted and fail to properly position the firm for a future characterized
              by rapidly changing technology.  The overall goal of this research is to
              provide a rational framework that leads to a planning horizon choice that is
              far-sighted, leading to decisions undistorted by potential end-of-study
              effects.
