Abstract    :
               Sheet metal forming is one of the most fundamental manufacturing technologies
              used in the production of numerous goods including hundreds of automotive
              components, consumer appliances, and beverage cans.  The occurrence of
              wrinkling on a part could be either acceptable or unacceptable based on the
              product specifications.  The ability of predicting such behavior is essential
              for shortening the development cycle and reducing manufacturing cost. This
              research project  will numerically and experimentally address the onset,
              post-buckling and secondary buckling behavior of thin sheets buckled into a
              wide range of wavelengths under in-plane compression with or without normal
              constraints.    This research project may reduce the computation time of Finite
              Element Analysis by about eighty percent while accurately predicting the onset
              of wrinkling. The success of this project will be extremely beneficial to
              product and process development at early design stage.   This is a
              collaborative research project between the University and an industrial
              partner.
