Abstract    :
              9713344  Austin    Joint US-German MCS and wide-angle seismic experiment to
              study the  Galicia Interior Basin/Galicia Bank rifted continental margin and 
              transform boundary with Iberia Abyssal Plain margin segment to the  south.
              S-reflector under the Galicia outer Bank will be the focus.  A dense
              instrumented MCS/OBS wide angle seismic profile (56 OBS  deployments) and 12
              deep-penetrating MCS profiles are planned. The  sediment-starved Galicia Margin
              is well constrained and has no  post-rift volcanic or slat tectonics associated
              with it which makes  is a good place to study rifted margins. Existing ODP data
              will  provide ground truth.
