Abstract    :
              CMS 9713561  PI: M. Arockiasamy  Florida Atlantic University    The proposed
              workshop on Fiber Reinforced Plastics (FRP)  will address construction and
              performance of FRP  productssubjected to loading conditions typical to cold 
              regions. Application area of primary focus will be civil  structures including
              transportation, buildings, and sanitary  facilities. One of the major concern
              regardimg the prolonged  use of composite materials is their ability to retain 
              integrity in cold regions where thermal cycling between  ambient temperature
              and cryogenic temperature is  experienced. Performance of compositre structures
              and  components is seriously affected in very cold environment.  Only scant
              information is available on the life cycle costs,  environmental degradation,
              and extreme environment  performances of the composites. The workshop will
              provide a  unique forum for the researchers, academics, practiving  engineers,
              and FRP product manufacturers to discuss problems  associated with FRP
              composites in extreme environments.
