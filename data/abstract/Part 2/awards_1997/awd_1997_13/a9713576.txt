Abstract    :
              The PI will reexamine the National Solar Observatory/Kitt Peak (NSF/KP)
              high-resolution daily and synoptic rotation helium 1083 nanometer
              spectroheliograms, and nearly simultaneous magnetograms, to produce a finalized
              set of coronal hole maps.  In making these maps, she will measure several
              properties of each identified coronal hole, such as the magnetic flux, area,
              position, average helium equivalent width, and heliographic position of coronal
              hole boundaries.  Resultant maps and information will be published through the
              NSO/KP anonymous archive and atlas.  Moreover, she will use these data to
              investigate the variation of coronal holes' properties on time-scales of days
              to the solar cycle, coronal holes' relation to the emergence and evolution of
              active regions and the occurrence to coronal mass ejections.    This research
              will provide important clues to understanding short- and long-term evolution of
              the solar magnetic fields, their extension into interplanetary space, and
              eventual effects on Earth.
