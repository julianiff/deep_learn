Abstract    :
              9713569  McDowell    To refine the vision of Materials Design Science and 
              Engineering   (MDS&E), develop a common understanding of its  fullness, and
              chart out a conceptual roadmap necessary to  pursue it within the broad
              materials education and research  community, the Materials Council of the
              Georgia Institute of  Technology, in collaboration with the materials faculty
              at  Morehouse College, will hold a workshop in the fall of 1998  in Atlanta .  
              The primary objectives of the workshop are to  identify the critical issues and
              potential impact of MDS&E  on the nationOs educational and research enterprise,
              both  obstacles and opportunities, and to identify specific areas  for
              follow-on workshops.  The workshop engages keynote  speakers and panel
              discussions in each of four themes:  Structure-Property Relations across Length
              Scales, Materials  Synthesis and Design, Elements of Process Design Science and
               Engineering, and Multidisciplinary Materials Education.  The  distinguished
              speakers and panelists in each theme are drawn  from a broad range of science
              and engineering disciplines.  A report outlining a refined vision of MDS&E that
              identifies  key challenges and opportunities will result from the  workshop. 
              This grant is funded by the Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities in the
              Mathematical and  Physical Sciences  Directorate.  %%%  The workshop
              contributes to the directions that should be  taken in future materials
              research and development by  examining anticipated needs and impact in the
              field.
