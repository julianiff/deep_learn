Abstract    :
                9713354  Ismail    This two-year award supports US-UK cooperative research in
              classical analysis among Mourad Ismail of the University of South Florida, Yang
              Chen of Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, William Evans and
              Brian Brown of the University of Wales.  The US investigator will work with
              Brown and Evans on the spectral theory of the Askey-Wilson operators. They will
              study applications of the Dyson Coulomb fluid approximation to develop
              asymptotics of extreme zeroes of orthogonal polynomials and  recursion
              coefficients.  He will work on the application of q-orthogonal polynomials in
              quantum transport in disordered electronic systems with Yang Chen.  The US
              investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in orthogonal polynomials
              and special functions.  This is complemented by Dr. Chen's expertise in
              mathematical physics and quantum transport and Brown and Evans' expertise in
              theory of computation and spectral theory of differential operators.
