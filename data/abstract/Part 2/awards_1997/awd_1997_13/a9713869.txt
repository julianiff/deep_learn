Abstract    :
              This project is working with selected Advanced Technological Education (ATE)
              programs to identify characteristics of strong mathematical components and
              chronicle the process of developing such components through a series of case
              studies which is being made available in print and on the Internet.  This
              information is being used by current and future ATE project directors to
              develop a more sophisticated understanding of the kinds of mathematical skills
              students preparing for technological careers are expected to have and a more
              realistic view of what ATE programs should accomplish in mathematics.  Specific
              goals of the project include:  (a) creating a vision of high quality
              mathematics for students in vocational and technological education programs
              consistent with high academic standards developed by numerous organizations,
              and (b) developing and publicizing a variety of effective strategies for
              creating challenging mathematical tasks.
