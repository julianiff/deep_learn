Abstract    :
              9713101  Buseck     In this project, individual particle methods will be used to
              characterize aerosols and to examine tropospheric processes that affect
              aerosol-particle size distributions, concentrations, and chemical compositions.
              These processes include the generation, fractionation, and reaction of marine
              aerosol particles; the modification of mineral aerosols as they mix with
              anthropogenic pollutants; the production of secondary sulfate particles; and
              the evolution of aerosols during long-range transport in the marine
              troposphere. The structure and composition of complex super-micron to
              sub-micron particles will be investigated at high spatial resolutions using
              transmission electron microscopy (TEM), both by imaging and by chemical
              analysis. With this method, the speciation of mineral and other particles can
              be determined, and beam-sensitive particles, such as those containing nitrate
              and ammonia, can be chemically analyzed.   The focus of the field deployments
              will be on particles of continental, marine, and anthropogenic origin in the
              marine boundary layer and marine free troposphere. In particular, samples
              obtained during the Aerosol Characterization Experiment-2 (ACE-2) will be
              analyzed. The PIs will participate in the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) and
              sample aerosols on board the C-130 aircraft.  Additional ground-based
              measurements will be performed in Hawaii and near Xian, China.
