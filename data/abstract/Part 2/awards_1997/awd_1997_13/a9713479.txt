Abstract    :
                 This project will undertake the development of a database of ground 
              magnetometers which will be utilized to extend the nonlinear state  space
              reconstruction technique to include spatially resolved  predictions and
              validation.  The objective of this work is to  produce quantitative regional
              predictions of geomagnetic activity  through the assimilation of ground based
              and satellite data.  The  validation work needed to transition the research
              algorithm will be  undertaken and the near real-time results of the algorithm
              will be  available via the WWW.
