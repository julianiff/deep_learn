Abstract    :
              9713977  Young  This grant supports the continuing work of a senior PI, 
              distinguished for his significant contributions to the  numerical analysis of
              several problems in statistical  mechanics.  In the present grant he is
              planning to conduct  theoretical studies of quantum phase transitions in random
               magnetic systems.  These problems can be solved using  sophisticated,
              state-of-the-art numerical techniques.  The  principal objectives are to:  (1)
              search for universal  critical behavior at the quantum transition and (2) to 
              investigate the characteristic paramagnetic phase  singularities, called the
              Griffiths-McCoy singularities.  %%%  Most phase transitions are classical, i.e.
              the phase  transitions takes place at temperatures which are high  compared to
              when the quantum mechanical effects become  important in a given system.  And
              yet, the transition  temperatures can be reduced by introduction of disorder. 
              Given the ease in studying material properties at low  temperatures, it is
              conceivable that novel transitions may  be strongly quantum in nature.  The
              combination of quantum  and disorder provides a framework which is both complex
              and  has not been studied well before.  This senior PI plans to  carry out  a
              numerical study, to lead to  an understanding  of what to expect in a quantum
              phase transition in the  presence of strong disorder.  ***
