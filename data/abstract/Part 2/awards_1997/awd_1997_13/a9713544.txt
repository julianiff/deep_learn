Abstract    :
              9713544  Petrenko  The fundamental nature of the adhesion of ice to metallic 
              surfaces will be studied.  Experimental data for tensile and  shear adhesion
              strengths will be correlated with the nano-  scale properties and structure of
              the ice surface and the  ice/metal interface, as determined by using nano- 
              tribological techniques, such as atomic force microscopy and  other high
              resolution surface and sub-surface materials  probes.  Results will also be
              correlated with the properties  of the liquid-like layer on the surface of the
              ice, such as  its thickness, electric charge and charge gradient, and its 
              capillary pressure.  The effects of applied electrical  fields will be
              evaluated.  The basic knowledge generated  should contribute to the purposeful
              development of ice-  phobic coatings.  ***
