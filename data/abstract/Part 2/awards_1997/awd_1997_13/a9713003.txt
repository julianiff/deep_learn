Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9713003  ELSAYED  Rutgers University    Quality and reliability
              engineering is an essential ingredient required to maintain the United States
              manufacturing capacity effectiveness.  Because of the importance of this area
              to U.S. industry, a planning grant, EEC-9526413, was awarded to Rutgers
              University and Arizona State University (including the Arizona State
              University) to explore the forming of an Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for Quality and Reliability Engineering.      As a result of a
              planning meeting held in July 1996, sufficient industrial support has been
              generated to become an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
              (I/UCRC).    The Center's initial research agenda will address:  Improving
              Products that are Judged by Objective Measurements and Consumer Panel Data;
              Optimal Design for Quality Using the Voice of the Customer; System Reliability
              Prediction with Uncertainty in Component Reliability Estimates; Integration of
              Bayesian and Physics of Failure Approaches to Obtain Test Time Compression; A
              General Reliability Prediction Model for Accelerated Life Testing; Accelerated
              Testing for Electronics Manufacturing; Data Mining with Multivariate
              Statistical Tools; Equipment and Process Characterization, Optimization, and
              Qualification; Multivariate Process Monitoring and Control; Software
              Reliability and Development Process Models for Automobile Systems; Process
              Capability Indices and Loss Function.    This proposal has been coordinated
              with Drs. Geogia-Ann Klutke and Lawrence Seiford, NSF Program Directors for the
              Operations Research and Production Systems Program.
