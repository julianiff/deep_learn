Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Chemistry Division and the Division of  
              Chemical and Transport Systems under the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic   Plasma
              Science and Engineering, Cosby will measure electron-impact   dissociation
              cross sections of molecules and radicals important for   plasmas at electron
              energies between the dissociation threshold and 200   eV.  Absolute cross
              sections, product translational energy distributions,   and product
              identifications will be determined for a number of small   molecules and
              radicals, including CFx, NFx, SiFx, BFx (where x = 1-3),   BCl2, BCl3, NO, N2O,
              SO, and SO2.  The measurements will be made in a   crossed electron beam-fast
              neutral beam apparatus.  Plasmas are used to process critical materials in the
              electronics,   aerospace, automotive, steel, biomedical, and toxic waste
              management   industries.  Therefore, it is important to be able to describe a
              plasma   and its complex interactions with materials.  The data gathered in
              this   project will provide input into models of plasma which will allow the  
              processing steps used in semiconductor fabrication and other areas to be  
              improved and optimized.
