Abstract    :
              The investigators are using visualization and tracking techniques in studying
              interplanetary type II radio bursts observed remotely from the Ulysses and WIND
              spacecraft.  Type II emissions are generated when coronal mass ejection-driven
              shocks propagate through the interplanetary medium from sun to Earth, and
              provide an intermediate link in the solar-terrestrial connection.  The
              investigators will better understand (1) the physical characteristics and
              dynamics of individual type II radio bursts, (2) the relationship of type II
              radiation to the coronal mass ejection-driven shocks and conditions in the
              interplanetary medium, (3) the characterization of the geomagnetic response to
              radio emitting coronal mass ejections, and (4) the interplanetary transport of
              coronal mass ejections, and predictions of their arrival at Earth.
