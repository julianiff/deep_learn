Abstract    :
                      ABSTRACT       The proposal seeks funding to co-sponsor a conference
              with the Engineering Foundation on " Understanding Heat Exchanger Fouling and
              Its Mitigation."  The conference will be held in Barga, Italy from May 11 to
              16, 1997.  The conference will cover many important subjects relevant to the
              mitigation of fouling in heat exchange equipment.  Funding from NSF will be
              used to cover the cost for several participants.
