Abstract    :
              This experimental and theoretical study will focus on plasma waves arising in
              sporadic ionization layers in the ionospheric E region at midlatitudes.  The
              researchers will investigate:  (1) the significance of the quasi-periodic
              structures observed by ground-based radar, (2) how well the standard model of E
              region plasma waves developed to explain electrojet radar echoes account for
              midlatitude HF observations, (3) the source of streaming instabilities at
              midlatitudes, and any revelation about fundamental E region plasma physics, and
              (4) the storm-time behavior of plasma waves in the midlatitude E region.
