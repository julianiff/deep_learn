Abstract    :
              Abstract - Economou  ECS - 9713262        This is a combined
              theoretical/experimental investigation of ion-ion (virtually election-free)
              plasmas in inductively coupled plasma (ICP) sources.  Topics addressed include
              the formation and spatiotemporal dynamics of ion-ion plasmas in pulsed
              discharges at very low pressures, the mechanism of negative ion extraction and
              acceleration under the influence of an externally applied bias, and etching by
              ion-ion plasmas, especially the contribution of negative ions.  Both fluid and
              kinetic models are developed in a hierarchial manner from analytic to
              full-scale two-dimensional numerical models.   Experimentally, the temporal
              evolution of negative ions, positive ions, and electrons in pulsed chlorine ICP
              discharges is measured for pressures in the 1 to 20 millitorr range.  The flux
              and energy distribution of negative and positive ions, and the etching induced
              by each, are also measured.    Ion-ion plasmas are formed in the late afterglow
              of pulsed discharges in electronegative gases.  Such systems are known to
              produce superior quality etching when used in microelectronic device
              manufacture.  This study provides fundamental insight into this potentially
              valuable but poorly understood system.
