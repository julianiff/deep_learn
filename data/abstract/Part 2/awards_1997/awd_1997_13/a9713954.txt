Abstract    :
              9713954  Mullen  The objective is to develop a series of liquid crystalline 
              (LC) stress chromic coatings for rapid identification of  over-stress
              conditions in the components of the  infrastructure, such as highway bridges. 
              These coatings  change color when subjected to stress/strain.  The material 
              can be formulated to return to the original color once the  stress/strain is
              removed, or the color change can remain for  weeks.  Diacetylene liquid
              crystalline polymers are the  materials of choice because of their stress
              chromic  properties.  The development of this coating will allow the  easy
              visual detection of stress levels in a material and  allow a more accurate
              identification of flaws (cracks) in  structures.  Early detection should reduce
              the cost of  maintenance and repair and ensure safe structures.  ***
