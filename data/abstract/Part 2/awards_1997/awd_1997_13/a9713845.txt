Abstract    :
              The PI will employ a new numerical approach for studying how the generation of
              Langmuir waves by the HF heater is influence by altitude variation in the
              heater intensity profile, and - on longer hydrodynamical time scales - by
              heater-induced spatial distortions in the plasma density.  In order to quantify
              the effects ionospheric inhomogeneity has on Langmuir wave energy, the PI will
              numerically determine modified thresholds for driving absolute instabilities
              for density and heater-intensity profiles based on observations and theoretical
              models.  Together, these two components of the research will answer:  (1) where
              and how is heater energy conve3rted to Langmuir waves in the ionosphere (before
              and after preconditioning)?  (2) what is the self-consistent kinetic nonlinear
              evolution of Langmuir waves and electrons? And (3) what is the distribution of
              accelerated electrons observed outside the heated region?
