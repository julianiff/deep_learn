Abstract    :
              This research project deals with a new method, called the  short-time Gaussian
              cell mapping method for solving  nonlinear stochastic optimal control problems.
               Stochastic  nonlinear optimal control problems can be found in civil 
              engineering structures subject to earthquake, ocean waves,  and wind loading
              excitations, in precision machines,  manufacturing processes and robots, and in
              armed vehicles  (land or air), target tracking systems and guidance systems 
              operated in combat or rough environments.  Few effective  methods exist for
              obtaining optimal control solutions of  complex nonlinear systems to random
              excitations. The method  has been applied to some very challenging nonlinear 
              oscillators under Gaussian white noise excitations and has  been proven to be
              effective and accurate in analyzing  complex nonlinear stochastic systems. This
              project develops  this method further for nonlinear stochastic optimal control 
              problems. The results of this research provide the  capability to more
              efficiently and accurately predict and  control the response of nonlinear
              systems subject to  stochastic excitations, to better assess the reliability of
               the system under harsh random environments, and to develop  new strategies for
              controlling the state-constrained  stochastic system.
