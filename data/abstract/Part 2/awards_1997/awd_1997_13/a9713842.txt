Abstract    :
              9713842  Chen  Computer  simulation methods for unsteady  lubricated  metal 
              forming processes are being developed using meshless methods  of  analysis. 
              Meshless  methods allow  the  domain  of  the  workpiece to be modeled without
              using a structured mesh thus  avoiding mesh distortion difficulties that occur
              during  the  course  of  large plastic deformation. The behavior  of  the 
              lubricated  interface, including the  effects  of  lubricant  flow,   pressure 
              gradient,  film  thickness,  and   surface  roughness, are included in the
              simulation procedures through  the  implementation  of a hydrodynamic unsteady 
              lubrication  model  into  the meshless formulation. Special  emphasis  is 
              placed  on  the  development  of  computationally  efficient  meshless
              formulations to allow for large scale simulation of  metal forming processes.
