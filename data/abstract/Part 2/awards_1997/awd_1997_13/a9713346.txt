Abstract    :
              In  large-vocabulary spontaneous speech, the variability  of  the 
              pronunciations  of words is much higher  than  in  read  speech  situations. 
              At the 1996 Summer  Workshop  on  Large  Vocabulary Conversational Speech
              Recognition (WS96), a model  for   this  variability  to  be  used  in 
              Automatic  Speech  Recognition  (ASR) systems was developed based  on  machine-
               derived  descriptions of speech data.  The  continuation  of  this  work in
              this grant focuses on studying the correlation  of  variation  in 
              pronunciations in continuous  speech  and  higher-level information not usually
              brought to bear  in  an  ASR  pronunciation  model.  One important  element  in
               this  model  is the rate of speech, which has been shown to  be  a  good 
              predictor  of  word  error  rate  on  both  read   and  spontaneous speech
              corpora.  Investigations into the effects  of  resyllabification (movement of
              syllable boundaries  when  words  are  spoken in sequence) and word frequency 
              on  word  pronunciations  are  also  undertaken.   The  goal  of  this  project
               is  to improve the predictability of variation  for  speech  recognition
              models, in particular for the  reduction  of  recognition  error  for
              spontaneous  and  conversational  speech.  The techniques will be evaluated on
              the Switchboard  corpus.
