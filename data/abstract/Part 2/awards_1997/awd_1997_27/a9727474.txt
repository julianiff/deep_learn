Abstract    :
                This research project, under the direction of Professor Emile  Schweikert of
              Texas A&M University, addresses the surface analysis  of trace organics.  The
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program  supports these studies of secondary
              ion mass spectrometry using  massive incident probe ions to enhance the yield
              of secondary ions,  and thus increase the sensitivity of the method. 
              Coincidence  detection methods developed by Professor Schweikert are used to 
              push the limits of detection in these measurements to the attomole  level. 
              Work is also underway to develop methods to improve the  detection of secondary
              neutrals formed in these cluster ion surface  collisions.  The results of this
              work provide improved tools for  the analysis of materials in the electronics
              industry and in the  understanding of important environmental problems.  The
              goal of this research project is to improve the methods  available for
              qualitatively and quantitatively detecting organic  materials at solid
              surfaces.  These methods will be crucial to the  improvement of electronic
              materials processing and to the analysis  of environmentally and biologically
              important samples.  Secondary  ion mass spectrometry using mega-projectile
              incident ions, coupled  with coincidence detection schemes promise a
              significant increase  in sensitivity for these analysis methods.
