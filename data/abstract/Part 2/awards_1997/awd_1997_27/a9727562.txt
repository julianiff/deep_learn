Abstract    :
              John Frederick is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue his studies of the dynamics   of
              photoisomerization and nonadiabatic relaxation processes.  The   objective of
              this work is to develop detailed models for the electronic   and vibrational
              dynamics of the photoinduced processes in the hexatriene   and octatetraene
              systems.  Quantitatively accurate potential energy   surfaces for the lowest
              three singlet states of these systems and the   nonadiabatic coupling between
              them will be derived using a combination of   high-level ab initio calculations
              and spectroscopic data.  Ultrafast   internal conversion and isomerization
              processes in these systems will be   studied using both quasiclassical and
              quantum dynamics.  A number of   specific questions regarding the
              photochemistry and photophysics of these   systems will be elucidated.  The
              photochemistry of polyenes is of central importance in a number of   natural
              processes, such as vision and photosynthesis, and in the   development of
              organic materials with conducting and photochromic   properties.  The proposed
              work has a potential for significant scientific   impact in providing a
              molecular level interpretation of these phenomena.
