              Abstract  ATM-9727872  Miller, Ronald   Columbia University  TITLE: Mineral Dust
              Aerosols and Climate Variability  The theme of this proposal is mineral dust
              aerosols as a contributor to and signature of climate variability. Numerical
              experiments will be designed, with the state of the art coupled
              Ocean-Atmosphere-dust generating models, to identify the processes controlling
              the variability of mineral dust within the atmosphere. Emphasis will be on the
              relation of dust to such familiar modes of atmospheric variability such as the
              Tropical Atlantic Oscillation (TAO), North Atlantic Oscillation NAO), and ENSO.
              This basic research will take the climate models closer to reality and make
              them better tools for projections into the future climate.
