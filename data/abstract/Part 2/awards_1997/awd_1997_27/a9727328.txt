Abstract    :
              9727328  Charlie  This action is to support the participation of Prof. Wayne 
              Charlie, Colorado State University, in CANLEX -- the  Canadian Liquefaction
              Experiment.    Many large structures, such as hydroelectric dams and  tailings
              dams, are either built on sand deposits, or are  partially constructed with
              sand. If the sand is loose and is  loaded rapidly, then the structure of the
              sand can collapse,  the soil can liquefy and a large amount of strength can be 
              lost. A major research effort is underway to study the  behavior of loose
              cohesionless soils. Much of this research  is part of a large collaborative
              research project called the  Canadian Liquefaction Experiment (CANLEX). This
              project is  controlled and managed at the University of Alberta in 
              collaboration with the Universities of Laval, Carleton and  British Columbia
              and with industrial support from Syncrude,  Suncor, B.C. Hydro, Quebec Hydro,
              Kennecott and Highland  Valley Copper.    Current research includes the study
              of the mechanical and  geophysical properties of loose sands and the
              development of  appropriate constitutive models. Research also includes the 
              study of mine waste materials found in large waste dumps.    Prof. Charlie is
              assisting in the current phase of this  project, namely to subject the Syncrude
              site in Alberta to  blast loading in an attempt to simulate earthquake cycling 
              loading.  The objective is to generate pore pressures in the  deposit of
              saturated loose sand sufficient to cause the site  to liquefy.  This is an area
              in which Prof. Charlie has had  considerable experience.
