Abstract    :
                This renewal project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry
              Program, focusses on the development of new continuous  electrophoretic
              separations in narrow channels coupled to capillary  sample introduction. 
              Professor Ewing and his students at Penn  State University will pursue work to
              improve detection schemes for  these separations using electrochemical arrays
              and post-separation  derivatization for fluorescence detection.  The goal of
              this work  is to develop a fast continuous or sequential analysis protocol for 
              very small samples taken from neuronal environments.  Another focus  of this
              work will be in using these methods to monitor enzymatic  reactions in order to
              do drug screening.  This project has both  fundamental and applied goals that
              will advance the sensitivity and  speed of small sample analyses.  New
              developments in continuous electrophoretic separations of very  small samples
              in narrow channels will be pursued in this project.   Professor Ewing and his
              students at Penn State University will  focus on substantial improvements in
              the detection limits for these  separations using both electrochemical and
              fluorescence methods of  analysis.  An important aspect of this work will be
              enhancing the  speed of these analyses using very small samples so that
              screening  methods can be developed in fields such as neurochemistry and drug 
              development.  This project has both fundamental scientific  components and
              important applied goals that will be of societal  value.
