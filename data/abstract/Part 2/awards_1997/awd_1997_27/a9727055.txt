Abstract    :
              9727055  Davis    The objective of this investigation is to make Global
              Positioning  System (GPS) measurements of 3-dimensional crustal deformation in 
              the northeastern U.S., combined with absolute gravity and tide  gauge
              measurements, to infer the viscosity of the lower mantle  and thus improve
              current models of glacial isostatic adjustment.  This will allow the PIs to
              determine the relative roles of  crustal motion and sea level rise in this
              region, and also  develop an improved estimate of global mean sea level rise
              from  the global tide gauge data set.  They will install 6 new  permanent GPS
              sites along the northeastern coast of the U.S.,  which will supplement the
              current sites in the Continuously  Operating Reference System (CORS), which
              will also be evaluated  for use in this investigation.  A related objective of
              the  investigation is to develop improved methods of GPS vertical  positioning,
              including modeling vertical motions associated with  pressure loading, tidal 
              loading, etc.  The PIs anticipate this investigation will result  in an
              improved understanding of sea level change in the  northeastern U.S., an
              improved model of glacial isostatic  adjustment, and an improved estimate of
              global sea level change  through the application of this model to the global
              tide gauge  data.  ***
