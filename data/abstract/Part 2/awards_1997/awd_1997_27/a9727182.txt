Abstract    :
              9727182  Garnero    This research is a continuation of efforts to map the three 
              dimensional shear wave structure of the earth's mantle and  produce a better
              seismic model for the outer core.  Previously, the travel times of S, ScS, SKS,
              SKKS and  multiple bounce S phases have been measured and inverted to  obtain a
              3-D model of mantle structure beneath.  Long linear  fast seismic anomalies
              interpreted to be slabs sinking to  mid-mantle depths were discovered beneath
              the Americas.  This work will extend the detailed analysis to Asian  subduction
              zones.  The core-mantle boundary layer D" will  also be investigated and mapped
              relative to slow velocity  features in the lower mantle, which may indicate the
               upwelling part of mantle circulation.  Better analysis of  the D" variations
              will enable the improvement of  investigations of anisotropy and heterogeneity
              of the inner  core.  ***
