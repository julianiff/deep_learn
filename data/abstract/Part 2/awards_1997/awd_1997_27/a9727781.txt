Abstract    :
              9727781  Edwards    As part of A Change of Course evaluation, NFIE will document
              successful  innovations of individual and small groups of teachers who
              participate in long term reform efforts. The NFIE team has constructed a four
              phase model of the change process. These phases tend to be overlapping and
              dynamic rather than linear.  Phase I incubation-a period of time during which
              new ideas are developing among a small group in the setting; Phase 2 Small
              scale application-a time period during which a small group of people are trying
              out the ideas in a fairly isolated situation; Phase 3 Transition to broad
              application-a  time where conditions are getting aligned to support movement
              from a few isolated applications to widespread use; and Phase 4 Broad-baed
              application-a time where the innovation is widely used and accepted. NFIE will
              document and analyze Phase 3 experiences of sites engaged in the reform of
              professional development. This study will investigate and document how teachers
              have progressed through his process enabling the formation of a model of
              innovation based around professional development.  ***
