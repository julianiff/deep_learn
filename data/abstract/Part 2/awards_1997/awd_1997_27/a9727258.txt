Abstract    :
              IBN:  9727258  PI-CARNEVALE     A newly developed computational tool for
              neuroscience is NEURON, which allows computer simulation of a variety of models
              of activity in nerve cells and small networks.  This short course gives an
              introduction to potential users to allow them to decide whether it will be
              useful for their own work, to introduce practical techniques and strategies for
              effectively using simulations, and to provide advanced users an update on new
              features.  Because this tool for realistic biological stimulation is
              specifically designed for a variety of computational platforms, it makes a very
              sophisticated tool that is widely and freely available.     The impact of this
              course is potentially very large, across all fields of neuroscience, because it
              promotes the integration of quantitative modeling into research and education
              in ways that extend far beyond what is now regarded as the domain of
              computational neuroscience.
