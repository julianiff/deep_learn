Abstract    :
              DMI-9727809  Moon  The goal of this project is to develop a low dimensional
              mathematical model based on experimental observation and to use chaos control
              techniques to quench the subcritical nature of the chatter. The research will
              use experimental and mathematical methods to obtain nonlinear models for tool
              vibration, including the effects of tool motion, velocity and thermal effects. 
              The unique feature of this research project is the use of concepts of chaos
              theory and nonlinear dynamics in developing new tool chatter diagnostics as
              well as chaos control techniques to quench chatter behavior in cutting
              dynamics. Further evidence will be gathered for a theory in an earlier research
              which indicates that chaotic dynamics is present in normal or non-chatter
              cutting of metals. As part of the nonlinear modeling, methods will be developed
              to predict and avoid subcritical chatter behavior. Basic mechanics of
              thermoplasticity and fracture mechanics will be incorporated in the model
              development. Partnership with both machine tool users and manufacturers will be
              sought.  The research will develop a new understanding about nonlinear cutting
              dynamics, which will likely result in new tool design methods for industry. It
              may result in mathematical tools which help manufacturers predict, avoid or
              control tool vibrations in cutting of metals and nonmetals to improve surface
              quality.
