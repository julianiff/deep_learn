Abstract    :
              Fauth  & Resetarits    9727039  &  9727543    Ecologists have long been
              interested in understanding the factors controlling the abundance and
              distribution of species and particularly concerned about identifying the
              processes controlling species diversity. This project focuses on understanding
              species diversity in Anuran communities in temporary ponds in coastal and
              sandhill regions of the Southeastern US, habitats with the highest levels of
              diversity for these organisms outside of the tropics.  Despite substantial
              earlier work, there is little understanding of the factors that influence the
              high diversity of these communities under natural situations.  This work will
              test a model of amphibian species richness in Southeastern temporary ponds
              using a series of replicated whole-pond experiments.  Ultimately, the model
              will be further developed and refined to include other taxa and systems.    
              This research will also address one of the most common criticisms of previous
              investigations of these amphibian communities.  Much earlier work has been
              conducted in artificial habitats and little effort has been made to relate this
              work to processes occurring in natural ecosystems.  Through its use of
              experimental manipulations of natural temporary ponds, this project will
              address this fundamental concern.  Ultimately it will be able to test the
              extent to which mesocosm experiment that are designed primarily to test general
              or specific ecological theories can simultaneously describe in detail and make
              specific predictions about the structure and dynamics of natural communities.  
               This work will have important implications for both basic ecology and
              conservation biology.  It will help to identify the factors that have
              maintained high Anuran diversity in Southeastern habitats while substantial
              reductions of amphibian species have been noted elsewhere in the US.
