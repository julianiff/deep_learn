Abstract    :
              This project investigates sex differences that have been observed in
              cardiovascular (CV) response to stress. The most common sex effect is greater
              systolic blood pressure responsivity in men than in women. However, some
              studies have yielded an opposite CV response pattern, others have yielded CV
              sex effects only on certain tasks, and still others have yielded no CV sex
              effects at all. Questions of where, how, and why the sexes differ in CV
              response are scientifically important, and also of practical concern because
              chronically high CV responses are suspected to contribute to the development of
              CV disease, for which men are at increased risk. The current project is based
              on a perceived ability analysis of CV sex effects, which begins with the
              assumption that women and men tend to differ in how capable they feel with
              regard to some tasks, but tend not to differ in how capable they feel with
              regard to other tasks. The analysis then applies a recent model of effort and
              CV response to identify conditions under which CV sex differences of different
              types should and should not emerge. In addition to shedding theoretical light
              on CV findings that have puzzled research scientists for some time, the
              proposed experiments should provide important new evidence regarding the
              fundamental perceived-ability/CV-response relation and afford a special
              opportunity to compare different theoretical views that pertain to it.
