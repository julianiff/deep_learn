Abstract    :
               Most research on American Blacks focuses on the social problems of the lower
              classes.  This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology
              student from American University, who will study African American elites.  The
              project will study the relation between African American women's use of
              `cultural politics`: ethnicity, cultural symbols, history and social
              interaction  and their involvement in focused social action to counter racism
              and economic inequality.  The student will conduct interviews with a sample of
              about 100 African American women divided into religious and secular leaders and
              non-leaders drawn from an elite population of women involved with national,
              state and municipal offices or organizations.  The interviews will focus on
              life history and engagement with discrimination, the formation of a self image,
              and involvement with social action.  This research is important because it will
              document the use of cultural politics to counter negative images and racism and
              to promote social change. The focus on religious as well as secular contexts
              will provide valuable information on how members of a minority elite use the
              social and cultural resources available to them to develop positive self-images
              and influence social policy. The results of this project should be of general
              interest, especially in light of the attention generated by the presidential
              commission on race.
