Abstract    :
              9727319  JEFFREY  There is now strong evidence that ultraviolet (UV) radiation 
              is increasing over certain locations in Antarctica and the  Southern Ocean as a
              result of ozone depletion. A reduction  in ozone concentration selectively
              limits stratospheric  adsorption of UV radiation and results in a higher UV 
              irradiance reaching the earth's surface. Research on the  impact of increased
              UV radiation due to ozone depletion has  focused primarily on phytoplankton,
              with a much smaller  effort being directed to other trophic levels. This 
              collaborative project will address UV radiation induced  damage and UV
              radiation effects on bacterioplankton. Studies  will examine interactions
              between bacterioplankton and  photochemical processes and interactions with
              higher trophic  groups such as phytoplankton and zooplankton. Topics to be 
              addressed will include whether bacterial-phytoplankton  coupling modifies
              bacterial response to UV radiation, how  seasonal changes in UV radiation
              affect bacterial community  dynamics and how chemical photoproducts impact
              bacterial  production.. This research project will elucidate the  molecular
              determinants responsible for changes in  productivity and the molecular and
              physiological responses  to changing UV radiation. The overall goal is to
              provide a  greater understanding of the potential impact that changes  in UV
              radiation have on marine microbial communities.
