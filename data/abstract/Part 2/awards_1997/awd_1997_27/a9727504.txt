Abstract    :
               This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              the University of Iowa.  The research investigates the effect of particular
              religious affiliation has on the political activity of women in the Solomon
              Islands.  While religious Christian doctrine stresses modernization over
              traditional customs, there is variation in how different religious
              organizations stimulate or suppress the political activities of women.  The
              project will investigate how the religious Christian doctrines that women are
              learning through affiliation with Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, Evangelical,
              Adventist, Pentecostal and other denominations relate to their involvement with
              social change organizations such as NGOs.  The student will interview women and
              their husbands or other adult male relatives who are activists, as well as
              those who are not activists.  Participant observation and focus groups will
              serve to discover variations in beliefs and activities, and archival
              information will provide historical context on missionary activities.  This
              research is important because it will advance our understanding of the sources
              of activism in a community where women have historically been inactive in
              political change.  The project will also advance our knowledge about this
              important region of the world.
