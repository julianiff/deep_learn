Abstract    :
              Scientific planning activities will be undertaken to further  develop the
              revised scientific agenda of the International Human  Dimensions (of Global
              Environmental Change) Program (IHDP).  These  activities will focus on planning
              for studies of the Institutional  Dimensions of Global Change (IDGC); of
              Industrial Transformation  (IT) to more sustainable production and consumption
              patterns; and  of Global Environmental Change and Human Security (GECHS).  An 
              implementation plan for research on Land Use and Land Cover Change  Program
              (LUCC: studies supported jointly by the IHDP and the  International
              Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP)) will be  developed.  Scientific
              capacity-building and networking, especially  with scientists in developing
              countries will be enhanced;  interaction between IHDP scientists and policy
              makers will be  developed; and scientific planning meetings and workshops will
              be  organized on emerging human dimensions issues such as the  interaction
              between global change and urbanization, health and  water.  These activities
              will be coordinated by the revamped IHDP  Scientific Committee with strong
              support from the IHDP Secretariat  recently established at the University of
              Bonn under a major grant  from the German Ministry for Education, Science,
              Research and Tech-  nology (BMBF).  Oversight for these activities will be
              provided by  the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU), with 
              cooperation from the International Social Science Council (ISSC).
