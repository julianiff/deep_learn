Abstract    :
              9727134  Lasaga    This grant provides partial support of the costs of upgrading
               computer facilities for the geochemistry research group at Yale  University. 
              New hardware purchases will include 2 DEC alpha  workstations with 64 bit RISC
              architectures, X-terminals to  provide additional access to these new
              workstations, PC's, a  Macintosh compatible workstation, a laptop computer,
              EXABYTE tape  drives and a high performance video card for graphics-intensive 
              applications.  The geochemistry group at Yale is at the forefront  of
              geochemical model development.  Research on dissolution  kinetics of
              aluminosilicates and the effects of water on the  kinetics of silicate melt
              crystallization utilize ab initio  quantum mechanical models and Monte Carlo
              methods to model  reactions and are highly computationally intensive.  Future 
              research will be aimed at modeling mass transport in hydrothermal  systems. 
              Code will be developed to model, isotopic exchange  between moving fluids and
              mineral grains, growth and dissolution  of framework silicates and metasomatic
              reactions.  Existing  computational facilities are now out-of-date given the
              rapidity  of obsolescence in the computer industry and the capabilities of  new
              workstations will be immediately beneficial to this group and  their students.
