Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              program supports research on silica-related compounds by Dr. Frank J.   Feher,
              Chemistry Department, University of California-Irvine.  Synthetic   methods for
              three types of silsesquioxane compounds will be developed:   
              incompletely-condensed silsesquioxanes from fully-condensed (RSiO3/2)n  
              frameworks; versatile precursors to water-soluble frameworks; and   endohedral
              complexes.  The goal is to develop methods for preparing the   target compounds
              in bulk for use in catalytic reactions.   A key step in   all of these
              syntheses is selective partial hydrolysis of fully-condensed   frameworks to
              give well-defined products.  Some of the resulting   compounds will be studied
              as models for surface reactions thought to   occur at catalyst sites with
              various numbers of proximate hydroxy groups   or at sites that control
              stereospecificity.  Others will be used to form   `cages` that can host small
              molecules, thus controlling reactivity.  Large assemblies of compounds
              containing silicon and oxygen called   silsesquioxanes have previously been
              synthesized and used as models for   silica and as building blocks for other
              network solids.  Compounds of   this type are used as catalyst supports for
              transition metals and as   catalysts in important industrial processes.  In
              this research, new   compounds in this family will be prepared in order to
              extend the   usefulness of this inexpensive class of materials.
