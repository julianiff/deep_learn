Abstract    :
              9727892  Diamond  This award will focus on the metabolic and genetic response 
              of mammalian cells to physical forces such as those  encountered in
              bioreactors.  The work is directed at  elucidating molecular level events which
              control mechano-  biological coupling.  With this understanding, changes in 
              environmental factors will be tested to help eliminate  mammalian sensitivities
              to externally applied forces.  ***
