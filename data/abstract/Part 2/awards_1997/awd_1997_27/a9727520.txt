Abstract    :
              9727520  Gould    Dr. Andrew Gould of Ohio State University will carry out
              several lines of research aimed at resolving puzzles associated with the
              microlensing phenomenon used to search for dark matter (sometimes referred to
              as MACHOs) that may comprise a majority of the mass of our Milky Way galaxy. 
              His principal areas of investigation are (1) Follow-up observations and
              analysis of microlensing events detected in the bulge of the Galaxy to better
              understand their nature; (2) Attempt to better determine whether microlensing
              events in the bulge of the Galaxy are better explained by a disk or spheroid
              mass function, and thus obtain important clues as to the nature of the lenses;
              and (3) Study what can be learned about the relation between the spheroid and
              the bar of the Galaxy from the ~10,000 RR Lyrae type stars that will be found
              in microlensing searches in the inner Galaxy.  Understanding the relation
              between the barred and the unbarred components of the Galactic bulge may yield
              important clues to a solution of the microlensing puzzles in this direction.
