Abstract    :
              Martin  9727979         The Symposium will bring together researches on diverse 
              process, organisms, and habitats in order to examine  differences and
              similarities, and also to identify reasons  for difference in costs and
              benefits of depositing eggs out  of water.  Scientists working on a variety of
              different  systems. Including vertebrates, invertebrates, and algae,  will
              share ideas and techniques to encourage exploration  across discipline.  The
              speakers will address the selection  pressures and adaptations these organisms
              exhibit, from the  physical properties of the materials in the egg masses, to 
              physiology and early development, to parental care in the  interlude zone.  A
              major purpose is to examine parallels  from marine and freshwater aquatic
              systems.
