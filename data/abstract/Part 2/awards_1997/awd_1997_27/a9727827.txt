Abstract    :
                Visscher    9727827        Terrestrial ecosystems are dominated by social
              species. Social  cooperation among conspecifics was a major evolutionary
              innovation that  occurred repeatedly in diverse taxa. The study of social
              insects has  provided unparalleled insights concerning both the evolution of
              sociality  and the behavioral mechanisms involved. Similarly the study of
              social  insects has contributed broadly to many fields of scientific inquiry.
              The  most important international organization of social insect scientists is 
              the International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI). This group 
              holds the only international congress devoted to research on social insects 
              every four years. Funds are requested here so that students, postdocs, and 
              early career social insect scientists from the United States can travel to  the
              13th International Congress of the IUSSI to be held in Adelaide,  Australia,
              from 19 Dec. 1998- 4 Jan. 1999.    Typically, IUSSI Congresses attract
              scientists from over 30 countries  and cover a wide range of disciplines
              including genetics, physiology,  behavior, population biology, ecology,
              evolution, and systematics. Largely  due to previous NSF funding, members of
              the North American Section  (NAS/IUSSI) presented 25% or more of the program in
              the three most recent  meetings (Munich, Germany 1986; Bangalore, India 1990;
              and Paris, France  1994). In turn, American social insect scientists
              substantially benefited  from this involvement.    Because this
              multidisciplinary Congress is the primary international  forum for discussion
              of new information regarding social insects, it is  essential that researchers
              and students from the United Stated attend this  meeting. Moreover, this
              congress will provide North American scientists the  opportunity to open new
              dialogues with overseas colleagues and initiate  plans for collaborative
              research. Funds are requested to insure that  American researchers are able to
              participate in this very significant  congress.    1
