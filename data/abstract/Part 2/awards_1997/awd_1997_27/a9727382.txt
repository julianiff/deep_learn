Abstract    :
              Helen Leung is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   to use
              Fourier transform microwave (FTMW) spectroscopy to investigate   perturbations
              of electric field gradients around quadrupolar nuclei.    Preliminary
              indications that these perturbations can arise from van der   Waals bond
              formation will be explored by systematic spectroscopic   examination of
              N2O-containing complexes and imidazole-containing   complexes.  Spectroscopic
              constants derived from rotational spectra will   be systematically compared for
              a series of complexes, to improve the   understanding of intermolecular
              interactions involving quadrupolar   nuclei.  This Research in Undergraduate
              Institutions (RUI) project   provides an introduction to modern physical
              chemistry research methods to   undergraduate chemistry majors.  Van der Waals
              molecules are held together by forces that are much smaller   than the chemical
              bonds that hold atoms together in a molecule.    Examination of the structure
              of weakly bound molecules in gas phase   complexes provides an opportunity to
              sort out the specific forces that   are at play in a controlled environment. 
              Weak van der Waals interactions   are important when molecules are in close
              proximity to one another, as is   the case in biological systems.  The research
              aspects of this RUI project   will serve as a meaningful educational vehicle to
              introduce the   scientific method to future scientists.
