Abstract    :
                Staubli  9727192    Research in molecular biology and genetics has led to the 
              development of techniques to delete or modify specific  receptors or signaling
              substances important for nervous  system function. This work has revolutionized
              the  understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of  physiological
              processes believed important for the brain's  regulation of memory, perception,
              and the control of  movement. The development of  methods to test the three-way
               links between the genetic changes, physiological mechanisms,  and behavior
              have lagged behind. This project develops a  method for stimulating and
              recording physiological activity  in the nervous system in such a way that it
              can be applied  to the model organisms often used in molecular genetics. The 
              hardware and procedures developed by the project provide a  way to assess brain
              function and changes in awake, behaving  organisms and relate them to functions
              at the molecular  level and at the behavioral level. This work would 
              contribute to understanding how neural systems at the cell  and molecular level
              work to mediate learning and memory, and  in a more general way, provides a
              tool to explore the link  between molecular biology and behavior in many areas.
