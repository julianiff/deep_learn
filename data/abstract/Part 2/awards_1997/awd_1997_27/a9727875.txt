Abstract    :
                Taam, Ronald  AST  97-27875      Dr. Taam will carry out theoretical
              investigations into the origin and evolution of close binary systems.  His
              research focuses on the common envelope phase of binary star evolution, during
              which the gravitational interactions between the two components lead to the
              ejection of a common envelope and the loss of significant angular momentum. 
              His investigations will be directed toward determining the parameters for which
              binary systems at long orbital periods are transformed into short orbital
              periods and those for which the binary systems merge, as applied to systems
              containing low to intermediate mass stars (as in cataclysmic variables) as well
              as massive stars (as in low mass X-ray binaries).  His approach includes
              treatment of multi-dimensional hydrodynamical processes and high resolution
              three dimensional studies of the common envelope phase using an Eulerian nested
              grid numeric technique.
