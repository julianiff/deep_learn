Abstract    :
              9727708  Fisch    The overall goal of this research is to obtain a better 
              understanding of the physical and chemical properties of several  unique
              self-assembled systems in the dilute, semidilute, and  concentrated solution
              regime.  Mixtures of both anionic and  cationic surfactants will be studied as
              a function of  temperature, solvent salinity, and relative concentration of the
               two surfactants.  Surfactant-alcohol mixtures will also be  studied to
              understand the effects of structural isomers on the  physico-chemical
              properties.  These research goals will be  achieved by application of a wide
              variety of optical and physical  chemical techniques such as light scattering,
              viscosity and  surface tension techniques to colloidal and micellar systems. 
              %%%  Surfactants and mixtures of surfactants are used extensively in 
              industrial processing, biological and pharmaceutical  preparations, and drug
              delivery systems.  Students studying the  physics and chemistry of
              self-organization in these systems, and  the manipulation of their properties,
              will acquire skills and  knowledge in an area of considerable technological
              importance.  ***
