              ABSTRACT  ATM -9727140  Dickinson, Robert A.  University of Arizona  TITLE:   
              Land-Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions: Mechanisms for the  Seasonal Variations  in
              Precipitation Over Tropical Land    This study will combine observations and
              modeling to examine the  mechanisms responsible for seasonal variations of
              precipitation  over tropical land and to determine how these variations are 
              affected by land-atmosphere interactions. The problems involved in  the
              difficulties with the simulation of North American monsoon and  the wet season
              over the eastern equatorial Amazon by the NCAR CCM3  climate model will be
              investigated. Diagnostic analyses and  numerical simulation will address the
              relative roles of land versus  ocean SST in determining the onset of the wet
              season and the  observed spatial patterns.    This work will further advance
              climate modeling effort which will  assist in attempting more accurate
              prediction of tropical climate.
