Abstract    :
                        Adeyeye  9727813    The success of arthropods as terrestrial animals
              is attributable partly to  their cuticle, a versatile structure that acts as a
              covering and skeleton.  Ticks belonging to the genus Ornithodoros can live for
              many years even when  starved. Moreover, the relapsing fever tick, Ornithodoros
              tuncaln, shows  remarkable resistance to desiccation. This project will
              investigate whether and  how the cuticle of 0. Turicata is biochemically
              modified in order to cope with  starvation and/or desiccation. Comprehensive
              biochemical analyses of fed and  starved 0. turicata cuticle will be conducted.
              In particular, proteins of  interest will be purified and characterized using
              various techniques.  Also  cuticular lipids of sequentially starved ticks will
              be analyzed. The cuticular  permeability will be determined and its possible
              correlation with changes in  cuticular lipids and proteins will be ascertained.
              Two other ticks that differ  in cuticular permeability and in
              starvation/desiccation hardiness shall be  studied to permit broader
              generalization about the role of cuticular proteins  and lipids in the of 0.
              turicata resisting desiccation. Because so little is  known about the chemistry
              of the cuticle of soft ticks, the proposed studies  will expand existing
              knowledge vis-a-vis the structure and functions of tick  cuticle.
