Abstract    :
              9727652  Bilham    This project is aimed at understanding the details of the 
              collision between two continental plates - India and Asia. GPS  (Global
              Positioning System) geodesy will be used to measure the  motion of some 100
              points distributed throughout parts of the  collision zone, between the
              northern plains of India, and the  Tarim basin north of Tibet.  In particular,
              the P.I.s are  interested in the unique processes that occur beneath southern 
              Tibet and the Greater Himalaya because these appear to be close to  the
              nucleation  zone of great earthquakes whose future recurrence will be 
              disastrous to the populations of northern India and Nepal.  The  study builds
              on their 1997 finding that the Himalaya are  contracting north-south at a rate
              of 21+-3 mm/year, but that this  contraction is largely concentrated in a zone
              less than 100 km  wide.  It appears that Tibet may also be contracting at 5-10 
              mm/year.  Observations indicate it is probable that Himalayan  contractionis
              largely elastic (strain energy developing for future  great earthquakes), and
              that Tibetan contraction at depth is  largely plastic (driving east-west
              expansion of  the plateau and surface seismicity).  The measurements the P.I.s 
              propose are designed to provide constraints on the physics  underlying these
              processes, and details of the transition zone  between them.  ***
