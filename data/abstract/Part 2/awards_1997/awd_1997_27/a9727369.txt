Abstract    :
              9727369  Aziz    This research project explores the growth of metal films 
              produced by pulsed laser deposition (PLD).  PLD uses an  excimer laser to
              ablate a target to produce the depositing  flux.  The principal objectives are
              to develop a fundamental  understanding of the kinetics of submonolayer island 
              nucleation and growth and of the kinetics of solute  segregation, trapping, and
              alloying.  Films are grown by PLD  with real time and post deposition structure
              and composition  analysis.  Systems are selected to provide a wide range of 
              monomer diffusivity and deposition rate for model systems,  such as
              face-centered cubic metals, where there is knowledge  of the values of the
              basic activation energy parameters.  Growth morphologies are followed in situ
              with RHEED and ex  situ by UHV AFM/STM.  PLD film growth is compared to films 
              grown by molecular beam epitaxy and to kinetic Monte Carlo  simulations and
              analytical theories.  %%%  It is anticipated that the enhanced understanding
              generated  by this project will aid in the production of new,  interesting, and
              potentially useful assemblies of material  films.  ***
