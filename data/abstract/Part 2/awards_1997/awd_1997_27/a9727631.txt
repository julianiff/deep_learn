Abstract    :
                    9727631  Morrow    The NSF Geosciences Education Working Group recommended
              providing training in education for geoscientists.  The SSI and the Aspen
              Global Change Institute (AGCI) will collaborate on planning, implementing,
              documenting, and evaluating a pilot workshop on K-12 education for
              geoscientists who attend AGCI's two-week scientific meeting in the summer of
              1998.  The goals of the workshop are:    1)  to raise awareness among leading
              geoscientists about why scientists' attention and involvement in K-12 science
              education is so important, and to equip them to share new knowledge and
              perspectives on education with their colleagues;  2)  to inform geoscientists
              about important educational topics (e.g. National Science Education Standards
              (1995), cognitive psychology, and constructivist learning theory), and to pique
              their interest in learning more about science education reform;  3)  to allow
              geoscientists the opportunity to examine potential roles they might play in
              support of K-12 science education, and to reflect on how they might best be
              able to serve (e.g. as an advocate of educational reform, resource of
              scientific information, or partner in educational product development).    The
              workshop will draw upon the expertise and support of key scientists and
              education professionals as planners, advisors, workshop presenters, and
              evaluators.  The workshop model could be instituted as a regular part of AGCI
              summer science meetings, and also as a part of other summer science institutes
              related to the geosciences.
