Abstract    :
              9727118  Ulmer         This award provides funding for the development of an 
              electrochemical system for accurate pH measurements in hydrothermal  solutions
              at temperatures over the range 100-450 oC and at  pressures of up to a kilobar.
              The development of an accurate pH  measurement system for use at such high
              temperatures and pressures  is expected to advance our fundamental
              understanding of chemical  processes in natural environments such as ocean
              ridge hydrothermal  vents and other volcanic areas where both the generation of
              life  and the formation of mineral deposits are of great interest. This 
              development project is to be accomplished as collaboration between  principal
              investigator teams at Temple University and Princeton  University (this award),
              and the Pennsylvania State University  (through a companion award).  ***
