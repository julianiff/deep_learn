Abstract    :
              The University of Maine at Farmington proposes to sponsor a one day regional
              workshop for the twelve public and private higher education institutions, and
              the seven two-year technical colleges in Maine and the three state colleges in
              New Hampshire.  The objectives of the workshop are to               Provide
              information to faculty and administrators on NSF programs that support
              undergraduate education reform with an emphasis on the National Science
              Foundation report Shaping the Future New Expectations for Undergraduate
              Education in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology.         Provide
              an opportunity to showcase a few successful ongoing undergraduate science and
              mathematics education curriculum innovations.         Facilitate the start of
              long range plans to improve undergraduate science and mathematics education in
              the region.    The workshop will provide information and resources to
              participants intended to assist in the development of institutional plans and
              encourage regional information and resource sharing.  *
