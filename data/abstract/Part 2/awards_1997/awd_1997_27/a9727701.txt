Abstract    :
                Intercomparison measurements between Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current  
              Profiler (LADCP) and Expendable Current Profiler (XCP) velocity profiles will
              be   conducted to better define the response function and noise characteristics
              of the   LADCP. Both noise and beam spreading are likely sources of uncertainty
              for   studies of the finescale internal wave field (vertical wavelengths
              smaller than   200 m). Beam spreading effects arise from horizontal
              non-uniformity in the   oceanic flow field and have the greatest impact at low
              buoyancy frequencies:   Lower buoyancy frequencies imply smaller horizontal
              wavelengths (greater   horizontal non-uniformity) for a given vertical
              wavelength. Therefore, the   comparison measurements will be done in a region
              where stratification is   relatively weak on a World Ocean Circulation
              Experiment (WOCE) cruise   running south of Greenland in the North Atlantic.
              Spectral models will be   developed to further understand these errors,
              delineate limitations of the   instrumentation and optimize processing
              algorithms for finescale   parameterization studies.
