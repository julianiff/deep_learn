Abstract    :
              9727651  Shonnard  The PI's propose to create an open internet-based workshop 
              devoted to pollution prevention (P2) research and education in  academia.  The
              goal of the open workshop and the associated face-  to face meetings of a group
              of core participants is to focus a  diversity of technical backgrounds and
              practical experience on P2  issues in higher education.  These core
              participants will be  chosen based on a brief position paper from a list of
              national P2  experts which will be compiled as part of the project goals.  The 
              objective is to formulate a set of recommendations and guidelines  for the
              conduct of P2 research in academia which will help to  establish the foundation
              for research scholarship and encourage  technology transfer to industry.  An
              additional goal is the  establishment of pedagogical approaches designed to
              ground  students in various technical disciplines on basic environmental 
              literacy and the fundamentals of P2 and it's implementation in  industry. 
              Results of the open workshop and meetings will be  summarized within a section
              of the proposed web site, will be  published in peer-reviewed literature, and
              will be presented at  professional meetings.  Additional P2 information and
              links will  form an integral part of the web site.  Abstracts from the 
              environmental technology program and results from NSF funded  research in the
              area of P2 will also be highlighted.  ***
