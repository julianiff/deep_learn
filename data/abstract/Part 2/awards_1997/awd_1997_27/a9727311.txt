              Abstract    97-27311  Fisher    Integrating linkages among aquatic and
              terrestrial components of arid landscapes    This research will address the
              following puzzle: In the arid Southwest, atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N)
              exceeds export by streams and rivers. While measurements suggest a huge
              (>10-fold) annual storage increment in the catchment and widespread N
              enrichment of the landscape, the opposite is true - usable N is rare. Both
              terrestrial and aquatic primary production are N-limited, and N2 fixing
              organisms abound in both environments. The objective of this project is to
              identify the hot spots (in space and time) for N transformation and retention
              and thereby account for the catchment-level N discrepancy. The investigators
              will focus on methods development for the flowpath approach; experiments in the
              uplands, tributary system and stream-riparian corridor; and developing an
              understanding of variance in these systems. The work will concentrate on
              processes rather than patterns, and is expected to lay the underpinnings for
              linkages between the empirical work and conceptual and mathematical models now
              under development.
