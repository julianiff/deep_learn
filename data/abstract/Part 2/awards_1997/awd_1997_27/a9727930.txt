Abstract    :
              9727930  ABSTRACT  CODATA  
The globalization of science is occurring in
              parallel with a rapid extension in the speed and sophistication of information
              and data handling technologies in their uses for scientific purposes. 
              Development in these areas permit the planning and execution of large scale
              scientific programs.  Such programs, in turn, frequenly require sophisticated
              data handling and processing techniques.  In view of the multilateral character
              of many large scale scientific programs, the handling, processing, and
              transmission of scientific data has become a major international enterprise in
              its own right, one that is vital to those scientific programs.  The Committee
              on Data for Science and Technoogy (CODATA) is a non-governmental, multilateral
              body affiliated with the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU.) 
              CODATA's principal objective is to facilitate worldwide communication on
              problems relevants to scientific data.  Like other memembers of the ICSU
              family, CODATA is comprised of non-governmental National Member Organization. 
              The National Acadmey of Sciences (NAS) fulfill this function in the United
              States.   A. U.S. National Committee for CODATA, which is comprised of
              non-governmental scientists, coordinates U.S. participation in the
              international body, with NAS serving as its secretariat.  This award will
              provide partial support to the NAS to continue the activities of the U.S.
              National Committee.  Additional support is also being sought  is also being
              sought from several other Federal Agencies:  DoE, NASA, NIH, and NIST
