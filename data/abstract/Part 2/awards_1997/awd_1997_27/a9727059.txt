Abstract    :
              Field  9727059  Global changes over the coming decades are almost certain to be
              multi-factorial, with altered levels of atmospheric CO2, temperature, nitrogen
              deposition, and precipitation. To date, no experimental studies address this
              full suite of interacting global changes in the field. Despite a profound lack
              of consensus on the nature of the interactions among these factors, the
              foundation for interpretation and prediction is built largely from observations
              on natural patterns and data from single-factor experiments. While these can,
              at least in principle,  yield access to the full suite of potentially important
              mechanisms, single-factor experiments and observations along natural gradients
              do not provide a context for evaluating our ability to predict the consequences
              of several, simultaneously operating mechanisms.    To address this lack of
              information, this project will use field experiments with a factorial
              combination of altered CO2, temperature, water inputs, and nitrogen inputs.
              Focusing on four integrated response variables - primary production, soil
              carbon storage, soil nutrient availability, and species or functional group
              composition - this research will test the null hypothesis that responses to
              warming and elevated CO2 in combination are essentially additive, the sum of
              the responses to the individual factors. The experiments will employ mini-FACE
              and infrared heater technology in a California annual grassland, where it is
              feasible to execute a design combining several generations of the dominant
              organisms, a range of treatments, and reasonable replication. To facilitate the
              comparison with model output, experiments with three levels of CO2 and three
              levels of temperature will be used.
