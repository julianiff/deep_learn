Abstract    :
              With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Vernon  Knight will
              continue his archaeological research at the site of  Moundville. Located near
              the Black Warrior River in Alabama this site marks one of the highest cultural
              achievements of pre-Columbian Native Americans. It consists of a large number
              of mounds arranged in roughly symmetrical order, many containing tens of 
              thousands of cubic meters of fill.  Archaeological evidence indicates that
              these structures, which were likely built  over extended periods of time
              contained religious structures at their tops and also served as burial
              chambers. Several have yielded large series of skeletons and burial goods. Of
              central importance is not the structures themselves but the natureof the social
              organization which made them possible. To construct such massive earthworks
              requires a social and political organization which can mobilize a large amount
              of labor for long periods of time. Dr. Knight's  research should provide
              insight into this underlying social structure.   Building on past work, Dr.
              Knight will conduct a number of analyses of excavated material. To understand
              the sequence of mound construction, careful chronometric dating is essential.
              This can be accomplished through AMS radiocarbon dating of single pieces of
              charcoal since this avoids the potential problem of sample mixing. Artifacts
              will be analyzed, photographed and illustrated in preparation for publication.
              The award will also provide summer time to permit Dr. Knight to write up the
              results.  This research is important for several reasons. It will provide data
              of interest to  many scientists. It will also increase our  understanding of
              how, at a technologically  simple level, complex societies develop and are
              maintained.                                                  ¥ ¢Á¥¥%Á_Á>¥ ¢?¥Á¢
