Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of
              the Chemistry Division, Cline will study the preferred molecular   trajectories
              produced in the photodissociation of related but   structurally distinct
              nitrosoalkanes.  The experiments will measure the   correlation between the
              angular momentum and velocity vectors of products   in the frame of the
              energized parent nitrosoalkane parent molecule in   addition to scalar
              population distributions among product quantum states.    In most experiments
              the angular momentum distribution of nitric oxide   product will be probed by
              polarized resonance-enhanced multiphoton   ionization laser spectroscopy. 
              Time-of-flight mass spectrometry   techniques or new variations on
              two-dimensional ion imaging methods will   be used to measure velocities and
              spatial anisotropies in correlation   with angular momentum polarization. 
              Experiments will be performed in   low-temperature molecular beams or
              low-pressure effusive jets.  The major   goals of this project are to examine
              the influence of molecular rigidity   and conformations on product trajectories
              and to explore preferential   helical product trajectories produced in the
              photodissociation of chiral   molecules.    The data gathered in this study
              will reveal useful information about   preferential directional forces in
              molecules.  The addition of many such   forces from a large number of molecules
              can result in macroscopic amounts   of work from molecule-sized systems such as
              biological motors and   hypothetical nanotechnology devices.
