Abstract    :
              9727057  Hatcher  One of the most subtle and pervasive aspects of human-induced
              global change is the chronic deposition of atmospheric nitrogen in the forests
              of the northeastern United States. The mechanisms by which inputs of inorganic
              nitrogen are converted to organic nitrogen and retained within the forest
              litter layer and mineral soil are key to understanding the fate of nitrogen
              from atmospheric deposition and its effects on carbon storage in forests.
              Currently, the processes by which inorganic nitrogen from atmospheric
              deposition is immobilized in soil are not understood. Whether or not organic
              nitrogen produced in soil is subsequently made available for plant growth or if
              it is stored in the soil-humus matrix are unknown. The "unknown nitrogen"
              fraction commonly comprises the largest single fraction of total soil nitrogen
              in conventional wet chemical analyses. This research will use 15N-nuclear
              magnetic resonance (NMR) technology to address these questions. Answers to
              these two fundamental questions are needed to fully comprehend the soil N
              cycle, and to predict the ultimate impact of chronic N deposition in forest
              ecosystems. This project will address these two fundamental questions by using
              existing long-term forest nitrogen addition experiments at Harvard Forest LTER
              site in Massachusetts, the Bear Brook Watershed in Maine, and the Fernow
              Experimental Forest in West Virginia.
