Abstract    :
              Determination of the age-at-death of individuals from their osteological remains
              is an important part of physical and forensic anthropology.  In the past, age
              determination has largely been treated as an `art,` with only minor attention
              given to the statistical bases for estimation.  In this project a large sample
              of known age-at-death individuals from the Robert J. Terry Human Skeletal
              Collection (currently housed at the Smithsonian Institution) are examined to
              fit various statistical models for age estimation.  Data previously collected
              by Drs. Thomas McKern and T.D. Stewart on 375 U.S. soldiers killed in the
              Korean War will also be entered into these analyses.  The McKern and Stewart
              data are housed in the Thomas Dale Stewart Papers at the Smithsonian.  In
              addition to presenting the results of the statistical analyses, this project
              will make the raw data from both the Terry and McKern and Stewart sample
              available to interested researchers faced with the problem of determining
              ages-at-death.
