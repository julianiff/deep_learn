Abstract    :
              9727269  Hu  The PI's Hu and Ramkrishna, are experts in their respective fields
              of mammalian cell culture and metabolic modeling.  This proposal combines these
              complimentary areas of expertise in an attempt to understand the protein
              productivity factors in hybridoma cultures.  The hypothesis is that cellular
              metabolism can be manipulated to maximize the efficiency of the process by
              minimizing non-productive cell metabolic states.  The specific aims of the
              proposal are to define the conditions of the cultures that lead to the
              different metabolic states, to determine what changes are induced by varying
              the concentrations of glucose and glutamine, and to perform metabolic flux
              analysis of these different states under steady state and changing conditions. 
              A cybernetic model will be developed to describe these different states under
              limiting environmental conditions, e.g., glucose and glutamine availability and
              to account for switching between states.  Reactor conditions will then be
              established which maximize antibody productivity.  ***
