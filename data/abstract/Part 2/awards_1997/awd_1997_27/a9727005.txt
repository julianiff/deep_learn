              International Symposium on  Liquid-Liquid Two-Phase Flow and Transport
              Phenomena will  take place in Antalya, Turkey from November 3-7, 1997. The
              conference is sponsored by the International Center for Heat and Mass Transfer.
              The objective of the symposium is to provide a forum for the exposure and
              exchange of ideas, methods and results in liquid-liquid flow heat and mass
              transfer.  Symposium topics include liquid-liquid systems and applications,
              flow patterns and characteristics, flow stability and transitions,
              liquid-liquid separations, measurement and instrumentation, surface phenomena
              and bio-systems. The conference will promote the exchange of ideas  between
              international scientists. The grant will provide the expenses of four speakers
              from the U.S. who have been invited to present plenary lectures. These speakers
              will also present lectures on their work at selected universities in Turkey.
