Abstract    :
              This  is  in  support of the International Leadership  Forum  for  Women  with
              Disabilities to be held June 15-20, 1997 in Bethesda,  Maryland.   One  of  the
               daily  themes  is  Communications   and  Technology  which  includes
              discussion of  universal  design  and  accessibility, accessing the Internet,
              small-budget publications,  and  improving outreach.  All of the world's
              cultures and regions  are  to  be  represented in this follow-up to the  UN 
              4th  World  Conference  on Women held in Beijing in 1995.   Daily proceedings 
              of  the  forum  are to be made available to off-site participants  via the
              Internet, where discussions are to be continued after the  forum meetings.
