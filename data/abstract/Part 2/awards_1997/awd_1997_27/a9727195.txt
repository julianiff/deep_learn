Abstract    :
              9727195  Berger    Funds are provided for three years of continued support of
              the  Scripps Institution's core repository.  Curatorial activities will 
              include the integration of newly acquired core and dredge samples  into the
              collection, their optimal preservation, the preparation of  catalogues and
              descriptions of the materials for selection of  samples by potential
              investigators and the distribution of samples  for research.  Information on
              the geological collections will be  continued to be supplied to the data bank a
              the National  Geophysical Data Center, where computer searches will facilitate 
              sample selection for researchers.
