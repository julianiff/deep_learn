Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry   program
              supports research in the laboratories of Professors David   Richardson and John
              Eyler at the University of Florida.  The research to   be performed will
              utilize electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion   cyclotron resonance
              mass spectrometry to examine the role of solvation in   the thermodynamic
              properties and the reactivity of metal complexes.    Specific areas to be
              studied include:  the effects of solvation on   charge-transfer in excited
              state complexes; measurement of solvent   binding energies; the relationship
              between gas-phase and solution-phase   reactivity of olefin polymerization
              catalysts; and reaction pathway   studies of metal-hydroxide complex catalyzed
              hydrolysis of biopolymers.    The biopolymer studies could lead to
              methodologies that greatly reduce   the need of solution pretreatment for mass
              spectrometric analysis of   proteins.  Inorganic complexes mediate a wide range
              of chemical reactions.  This   research will lead to an improved theoretical
              understanding of the   behavior of metal complexes in solution and enable the
              production of more   desirable complexes for reaction specific reagents and
              catalysts.
