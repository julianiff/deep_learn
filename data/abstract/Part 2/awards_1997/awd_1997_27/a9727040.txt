Abstract    :
              ***  9727040  Richman     This project is a study of the formation of deep and
              bottom water masses on the continental shelf off East Antarctica.  In a
              collaborative program with the Australian Cooperative Research Centre for the
              Antarctic and Southern Ocean Environment, a series of oceanographic moorings
              will be set out in early 1998 and recovered in December 1998.  This project
              will contribute two current meters, temperature recorders, and
              temperature-salinity sensors to be incorporated into the Australian moorings,
              and participate in the analysis of the recovered data.   The antarctic
              continental shelves are the source regions for globally distributed deep water
              masses, particularly Antarctic Bottom Water.  Water intruding on the
              continental shelf is cooled because the atmosphere extracts heat from the ocean
              at high latitude, and its salinity may be increased because of ice formation. 
              Newly formed sea ice is substantially less salty than the ocean water in which
              it froze; the excluded salt thus raises the salinity of the remaining water. 
              Since both processes increase the density of the water mass it will flow to the
              ocean bottom, driven by gravity.  The rate at which deep and bottom water
              masses are replaced is an important factor in global climate issues such as the
              oceanic uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide and the latitudinal temperature
              gradient.   The mooring site will be off the Mertz Glacier, where an annually
              persistent area of open water enhances both ocean heat loss to the atmosphere
              and ice formation.  Both the deployment and recovery of the moorings will be
              done from the Australian supply ship  M.V. Aurora Australis.  ***
