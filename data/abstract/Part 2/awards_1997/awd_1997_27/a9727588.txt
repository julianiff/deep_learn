              Abstract          97-27588  Ward and Wetzel    Effects of wetland habitats on
              fate of dissolved organic matter in a forested wetland    Wetlands are
              important interface features of landscapes because they modify water flow and
              material received from upgradient regions of watersheds as well as determine
              the quantity and quality of material transported downstream.  However, the
              processes by which wetlands modify materials are not clearly understood.   In
              this project we examine the effectiveness of habitat features associated with
              different marsh environments in retention, transformation, and export of
              dissolved organic carbon (DOC).  Experiments will be performed in simulated
              wetland habitats in a state-of-the-art glasshouse facility, where water flow,
              temperature, light regime, and water chemistry can be controlled.  Amendments
              of radio labeled DO 14 C will be tracked in these habitats to determine the
              amount of carbon retained on surfaces (sediments, plants, wood), transformed to
              gases (CO2 and CH2), and exported.  Additional experiments will determine the
              effects of UV radiation on characteristics and retention capabilities of
              microbial communities attached to the surfaces.
