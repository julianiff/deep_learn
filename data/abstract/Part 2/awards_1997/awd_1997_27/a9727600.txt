Abstract    :
                  9727600  Yarger    This project is a collaboration between faculty members
              from the geosciences and curriculum and instruction to address pressing needs
              in science education.  The primary outcome of the project will be a model for
              improving beginning science courses and preparing teachers of science.  An
              introductory meteorology course is targeted for this project. 
              Student-directed, computer-based simulations will be developed and integrated
              into the introductory meterology course to facilitate the learning of difficult
              concepts.  These simulations will record student actions and replay those
              actions for later study and discussion.  For preservice teachers enrolled in
              meterology, a concurrent companion course will be created to encourage
              reflection on and understanding of the learning and teaching strategies that
              are productive in the simulated environments.  This course will be based on a
              constructivist philosophy of learning and will make extensive use of the
              students actions recorded by the simulations.  This project contributes to an
              ongoing movement to change a large lecture class to an environment where
              students can construct their own understanding of science.  It shifts the goals
              of the meterology course from the learning of science content toward learning
              how to learn science.  This shift will be beneficial to all students, but it
              will be of special importance to preservice teachers as an anchor for their
              subsequent education activities.
