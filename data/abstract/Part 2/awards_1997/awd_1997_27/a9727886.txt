Abstract    :
              9727886  Peirce  This is an award to support the exploratory phase of a research
               project to determine the impact that land application of sludge  has on ozone
              pollution in the lower levels of the troposphere.  The investigator will
              conduct laboratory experiments to determine  the flux of reactive nitrogen
              oxide from agricultural soils in  the absence of nitrogen amendments, in soils
              that have been  amended with sludge and soils fertilized chemically.  Soils to
              be  investigated will be obtained from agricultural land comparable  to that
              currently being used for land application of sludge.  Sludge will be obtained
              from the Chapel Hill, North Carolina  wastewater treatment plant.  Results of
              laboratory experiments  will be compared with those from field studies to
              determine the  scope of additional research needed to relate existing knowledge
               of the flux of reactive nitrogen oxide from natural and  chemically fertilized
              soils to soils that are used for sludge  management.    The proposal leading to
              this award was submitted under Special  Guidelines for Small Grants for
              Exploratory Research (SGER) in  NSF 95-27, Grant Proposal Guide.  Conditions
              relating to  production, transport and emission of nitrogen oxide from natural 
              and chemically fertilized soils are currently well defined.  Recent emphasis on
              aggressive use of land for sludge management  suggests determining whether this
              knowledge is sufficient to  establish nitrogen oxide emission characteristics
              from these  soils and their role in contributing to emission and formation of 
              atmospheric ozone.  Results of this project are expected to be  used in
              determining the need further research to guide  engineering design of land
              application systems for management of  sludges and conditions under which air
              pollution from this source  can be minimized or eliminated.  ***
