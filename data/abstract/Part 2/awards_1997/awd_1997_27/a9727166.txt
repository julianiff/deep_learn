Abstract    :
              9727166  Banaszak-Holl    This project explores the synthesis and study of
              simple molecules  that   can   provide  models  of  silicon/silicon  oxide  
              device  interfaces  consisting  of 1-4 layers of silicon  oxide,  silicon 
              nitride,  or  silicon oxynitride on silicon. The models  will  be  used   to  
              properly  interpret  the  infrared  (IR)  and   x-ray  photoelectron  
              spectroscopy  (XPS)  of  6-16   Angstroms   thick  stoichiometric interface
              regions. Also, physisorbed, well-defined  cluster  molecules  will allow an
              additional 10-30  Angstroms  of  silicon oxide to be placed on top of the model
              interface to  make  a   crude  model  of  stoichiometric  silicon  dioxide  in 
              close  proximity  to  the interface. XPS and surface IR spectra  of  the 
              stoichiometric  model,  and  the stoichiometric  interface  model  covered by
              additional oxide, can be obtained over the full  range  of actual electronic
              device dimensions.  %%%  The  scaling of device dimensions has resulted in
              commercial gate  oxide  thicknesses ranging from 100 Angstroms to as thin as
              20-50  Angstroms.  These  extremely  thin  oxide  films  are   primarily 
              interfacial  in  nature, with the stoichiometric silicon  dioxide  exhibiting 
              different properties from bulk silicon  dioxide.  The  growth  and optimization
              of these nanostructured thin  films  are  crucial  for  the  overall 
              optimization  of  electronic   device  performance.  ***
