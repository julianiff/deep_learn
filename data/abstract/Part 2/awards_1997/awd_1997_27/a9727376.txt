Abstract    :
              This project was suggested by questions from focus group respondents to a
              forest-valuation, multi-attribute utility (MAU) questionnaire-in-the-making,
              who asked, in so many words, `Should we use our personal preferences in
              responding or should we put on our citizen hats and try to say what we think
              would be in the public interest?`  The possibility that at least some
              significant fraction of ordinary people have available to or more preference
              orderings over unfamiliar, albeit not wildly exotic, environmental options
              offers a striking contrast to the view, coming out of psychology, that people
              are unlikely to be aware of any preferences in such settings, until these are
              constructed during questioning.  Our objective is to investigate the claim of
              these respondents by seeking evidence for or against it in a specially devised,
              3-attribute MAU survey about preferences over management options for a forested
              park in Nashville, TN.  Our general hypothesis is that, by stressing one or
              another of several `themes` for the questions, we can trigger predictably
              different response patterns across subsamples.  While there is a long and
              respectable literature concerning the existence and importance of multiple
              preference orderings co-existing in the same individual, not nearly enough is
              know about the phenomenon empirically.  Greater knowledge will help us
              understand its practical importance in such current areas of research as: the
              use of information as a policy tool; the interpretation of warm glow effects
              and non-use benefits; and even the explanation of the observed difference
              between mean bids evoked by dichotomous and by open-ended CV question formats.
