Abstract    :
                DMS 9727879    International Conference on Spectral and High Order Methods,
              1998    ICOSAHOM98 will be the fourth International Conference On Spectral And 
              High Order Methods. The first three meetings were held in Como, Italy  in June
              1989, Montpellier France in June 1992 and Houston Texas in June  1995. With a
              frequency of three years ICOSAHOM has played the role of  an international
              focal point in the field of spectral and high order  methods and the conference
              and its proceedings have proven to be  essential to researchers active in
              developing new algorithms as well as  those that implement high order methods
              to solve realistic problems of  interest to scientists and engineers.  The
              objective of the conference  is to bring together researchers with interest in
              the theoretical,  applied and computational aspects of high order and spectral
              methods.  Subjects include, but are not limited to, spectral methods,
              high-order  finite difference and finite element methods, h-p finite element 
              methods and wavelet based methods for the solution of partial  differential
              equations. Applications include electromagnetics, fluid  and structural
              dynamics problems, efficient solvers and preconditioners  for high order
              methods and parallel aspects of spectral and high order  methods. It is
              anticipated that the participants will include  physicists, mathematicians,
              scientists and engineers from many other  areas involving and utilizing
              spectral and high order methods.
