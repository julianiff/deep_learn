	Fluxes of heat and momentum from the oceanÆs surface to the
              atmosphere are known to be important to the development of a variety of
              meteorological phenomenon.  Despite the importance of this problem, little
              actual data has been collected of surface fluxes under high wind conditions
              (>15 m/s).  
This research project will utilize data collected during the
              Fronts and Atlantic Storm Tracks Experiment (FASTEX) to document the
              relationship between mid-ocean surface fluxes and boundary layer structure and
              the structure and evolution of the mid-oceanic extratropical cyclones.  FASTEX
              is an international research field program whose objective is to understand the
              mid-oceanic development of extratropical cyclones.  Its field phase was
              conducted in January-February, 1997.  This research will focus on ship-based
              surface-flux measurements collected in a high wind-speed marine environment,
              the associated sea state measurements, and the quasi-continuous measurements of
              the mid-oceanic boundary-layer structure.  It is unknown to what extent present
              flux and boundary layer parameterizations represent these environmental
              conditions.  Despite the significant fluxes likely to be present under these
              conditions, very few such measurements have been obtained previously.  More
              than 130 hours of data were collected during FASTEX by the RV Knorr under these
              conditions, representing a multi-fold increase in the amount of data available
              in this wind speed range.  The measurements will be used for the
              validation/modification of current marine flux and planetary boundary layer
              parameterization schemes used in forecast models.  Because the FASTEX flux and
              boundary layer measurements were obtained within and in coordination with a
              larger field program with extensive downwind mesoscale validation data, these
              measurements will also be able to provide a clear demonstration of their impact
              on marine extratropical cyclone development and forecasting.
