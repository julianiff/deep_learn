Abstract    :
              9727777  Yocum    The ability of photosystem II (PSII) to oxidize water to O2
              requires the redox activity of a tetranuclear Mn cluster that is regulated by
              the presence of a 26.5 kDa extrinsic protein called Manganese Stabilizing
              Protein, or MSP.  The structure and function of this protein will be probed
              using bacterial overexpression to produce site-directed mutants. 
              Characterization of existing mutants shows that a disulfide bridge is not
              required for activity, that mutations affecting the N- and C-termini of MSP
              alter its ability to assemble with PSII, and that temperature-sensitive
              mutations that alter secondary structure can be induced to rebind to PSII. 
              Building on these results, new experiments on MSP will focus on:  1.  Effect of
              N- and C- terminal mutations on PSII binding and activity reconstitution;  2. 
              Elucidating the mechanism by which a charge reversal mutation, R151D fails to
              restore high turnover rates in PSII;  3.  Creating new mutations in efforts to
              provide new details about the effect of binding to PSII on MSP structure and
              activity, to determine whether engineered Cys mutations can provide new sites
              for covalent modification of MSP, and to attempt to identify MSP domains that
              are sensitive to Mn oxidation states.    The ability of photosynthesis to
              produce atmospheric oxygen requires Manganese Stabilizing Protein.  This
              project's goal is to understand how the protein facilitates oxygen evolution. 
              Amino acids in the protein will be changed using molecular biological
              techniques.  How these changes affect oxygen production will then be analyzed
              by examining mutated proteins to determine if their structures have been
              altered, and by assessing their ability to restore oxygen evolution.  By
              comparing data from a number of modified versions of this protein, a model can
              be constructed that relates properties of Manganese Stabilizing Protein to
              those of the oxygen-evolving reaction.
