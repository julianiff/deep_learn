Abstract    :
              Reilly  9727212         In vertebrate locomotion there is a general paradigm 
              that limb postures in tetrapods have evolved from a  sprawling posture, with
              the limbs held laterally to the  body, to an erect posture, with the limbs held
              directly  under the body.  Accordingly, a three grade system  (sprawling,
              semi-erect , and erect postures) has been widely  used to categorize locomotor
              anatomies and their presumed  functional mechanisms in tetrapods.  However, to
              define and  understand this biomechanical transition, we need data on  the
              ground reaction forces generated by the footfalls of a  variety of animals
              using different postural grades to be  able to understand how the dynamics of
              propulsive forces  change with limb position during locomotion.       The goal
              of this project is to develop a four-step  force plate system to record ground
              reaction forces from  small vertebrate animals.  The system will be designed
              for  the size and gait characteristics of a series of vertebrates  representing
              all of the classes.  Force plates will be  constructed and calibrated and then
              preliminary studies of  representative species will be undertaken to
              demonstrate the  utility of the system and to prepare for larger scaled 
              integrative studies that will simultaneously record ground  reaction force ,
              kinematic and electomyographical patterns  in species spanning the sprawling to
              erect transition.
