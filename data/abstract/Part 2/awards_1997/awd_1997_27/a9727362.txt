Abstract    :
              9727362  Feng    This grant provides partial support of the acquisition costs of
               an X-ray attenuation-based particle size analyzer for the geology  Department
              at Dartmouth College.  This device measures continuous  particle size
              distribution in samples by measuring the time  varying attenuation of X-rays
              passing through samples as  particles fall under the force of gravity through a
              liquid  medium.  The basic principle of the measurement relies on Stokes'  Law
              of particle settling; larger particles settle more rapidly  (neglecting
              particle shape and density variations) than smaller  particles.    The particle
              size analyzer will be used for a variety of funded  research projects both for
              grain size analysis and as an  alternative mineral separation technique. 
              Studies of size-  dependent isotopic exchange between zeolite minerals and 
              surrounding fluids, size-dependent/surface area dependent  silicate mineral
              weathering rates and provenance studies of  marine sediments will take
              advantage of the instruments ability  to rapidly measure continuous grain size
              distributions over a  wide range of silt and clay sized particles (100
              microns-10 nm).  Several researchers at Dartmouth will make use of this
              equipment  and will involve undergraduate students in the analytical phases  of
              their respective research programs.  ***
