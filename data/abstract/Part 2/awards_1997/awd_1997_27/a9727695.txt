Abstract    :
                This investigation identifies, explores, and explains the evolving political
              and economic preferences of citizens in new African democracies.  How committed
              are African elites to the political and economic freedoms introduced by reform
              movements in the late 1980s and early 1990s?  How popular are liberalization
              initiatives among ordinary citizens?  Beyond these empirical questions, for
              which currently there is little information, lie issues of broad theoretical
              import.  Are there relationships between support for political democracy and
              support for a market economy?  Are attitudes to reform manifest in political
              and economic behavior?  At stake here is the emergence of a political and
              economic culture that can help a fragile regime of democratic capitalism to
              survive and, over the long run, to consolidate.  Designed comparatively, this
              collaborative investigation elicits individual-level data from both mass and
              elite actors by means of national probability sample surveys in three
              countries.  Data are gathered and analyzed by the investigators each working
              closely with a partner research institution in Benin and Ghana.  These
              countries differ significantly in terms of their colonial experiences, cultural
              and ethnic characteristics, recent economic history and endowments, and
              institutional experiences.  Thus, sub-Saharan Africa offers social scientists a
              rich diversity of settings in which to comparatively evaluate explanations of
              support for democratic capitalism.
