Abstract    :
              Curtis  9727159    Integrative reviews of published research have become
              increasingly  important in uncovering general classes of plant and ecosystem 
              response to rising atmospheric CO2 and in estimating the size of  those
              responses. Meta-analysis is an objective and statistically  rigorous approach
              to integrating primary research results where  the goal is to estimate the
              overall magnitude of an experimental  treatment across many independent
              studies. It is important from a  scientific as well as a policy perspective
              that results from  elevated CO2 research be integrated using these tools.    I
              have three primary objectives:  1. The establishment of a comprehensive,
              digital data base of all  vegetation CO2 response results  published to date. 
              2. Integration and synthesis of these results using meta-analytic  methods.  3.
              Distribution of this database via a server at the Carbon  Dioxide Information
              Analysis Center  of Oak Ridge National Laboratory.    The combined results of
              my meta-analytic work and the improved  access of other researchers to this
              large database will lead to  substantial improvement in our understanding of
              the likely  magnitude of vegetation carbon gain in a future, higher CO2 world, 
              and of the biotic and abiotic interactions affecting that carbon  gain. This
              will be of importance to basic researchers and modelers  working from the whole
              plant to the ecosystem level.
