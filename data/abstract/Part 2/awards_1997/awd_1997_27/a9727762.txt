Abstract    :
              9727762  Bennett  This study examines how the pulmonary and cardiovascular
              systems respond to increased metabolic demands for increased oxygen delivery
              and carbon dioxide removal in very different tissues: the skeletal musculature
              and the intestine.  Is the pattern of increased ventilation and circulation
              stereotyped, such that the same response (heart rate, stroke volume, breathing
              frequency, and tidal volume) is used for equal energetic demands in the two
              different tissues, or is it plastic, dependent on which tissue is active?  If
              both tissues are active simultaneously, which receives priority allocation for
              oxygen delivery and carbon dioxide removal?  Large reptiles will be used as
              model systems to investigate these patterns, because metabolic increments
              associated with digestion are extraordinarily large in these animals,
              approaching those associated with physical activity.
