Abstract    :
              Abstract - Lund - 9727315  Prof. Carl R. F. Lund, of SUNY-Buffalo, will
              investigate the selective para-chlorination of toluene over ZSM-5 catalyst.
              This study on zeolite catalysis is relevant in the pharmaceutical,
              agrochemical, fine chemical, and basic chemical industries. The research will
              be focused on (a) the mechanism of liquid-phase chlorination by Cl2 and SO2Cl2
              at low temperature, (b) the characterization of active sites, (c) the mechanism
              of deactivation, and (d) the improvement of ZSM-5 activity, selectivity and
              endurance. The characterization methods will include XRD, ICP-AES, IR, BET
              adsorption, and NH3 and SO2 adsorption and desorption. Adsorption calorimetry
              will provide information for the energy terms of a microkinetic model. 
              Procedures for activity recovery --such as oxidation or solvent extraction--
              and for activity maintenance --such as cyclic operation--  will be
              investigated. Two graduate students will be involved in the research; knowledge
              transfer to undergraduate courses will occur by means of new problems for
              kinetics and reactor design courses.
