Abstract    :
              Shaffer  9727161      This research program uses the analysis of DNA sequence
              variation to quantify levels of population differentiation in freshwater and
              terrestrial turtles from three continental regions:  the central United States,
              the western and northern Amazon basin, and eastern Australia.  In each of these
              regions, there have been severe climate changes during the past 15,000 years,
              and these changes have had impacts on the past and current distribution of all
              plants and animals, including turtles.  For example, about 17,000 years ago
              most of North Dakota and Minnesota were under glacial ice, whereas today they
              are fully inhabited by species that have migrated north from warmer areas.  DNA
              sequence data from at least two genes will be used to quantify the extent of
              these post-glacial migration patterns, focussing on turtles because they have
              very long generation times, and should show the maximal impacts of these past
              events in their current populations.    More generally, these data will provide
              information on how one can use molecular genetic data from long-lived species
              to understand levels of migration, population fluctuations, and population
              stability.  Such data are frequently utilized in disciplines ranging from
              conservation and managment to basic ecology and evolution, and they hinge on
              the assumption that past climatic fluctuations have has a negligable impact on
              current populations.  These data will inform us on whether such assumptions are
              valid, or are in need of revision.
