Abstract    :
              Manteuffel   9727525           The researcher and his colleagues organize a
              conference   devoted to iterative methods for the solution of linear and  
              nonlinear systems of equations.  Particular themes are   nonsymmetric linear
              systems, globally convergent algorithms for   nonlinear systems, algorithms of
              optimal order of work, saddle   point problems, and applications on
              multiprocessor computer   architectures.        The mathematical description of
              real-world problems leads   inevitably to equations to solve.  Many times the
              equations are   nonlinear ones, arising because the underlying problem is  
              nonlinear.  Often, however, the original problem is linear and   the
              mathematical equations are too.  Such problems arise in all   areas of science
              and technology, and are of special interest in   biology, materials,
              environmental studies, and manufacturing.     Progress in these areas requires
              solution of more comprehensive   modeling equations --- such models are usually
              more nonlinear   than simpler models ---, or more accurate solution of existing
                models --- increasing the size of the numerical problem to be   solved.  In
              certain problems, notably in fluid flow and in   elasticity, computational
              methods for the equations describing   the phenomena yield numerical systems
              having a saddle point;   the solution is on a surface that looks locally like a
              saddle.   Computational methods for such problems offer special   difficulties.
               The conference addresses advances in algorithms   to deal with larger
              numerical systems, nonlinearities, the   amount of time and work needed to get
              a solution, saddle points,   and the use of multiprocessor computers.
