Abstract    :
              9727808  Barbosa-Canovas  This proposal requests $7,500 to provide partial
              support for  travel for academic speakers at the 1997 Conference of Food 
              Engineering (CoFE `97).  CoFE `97 will be a Topical  Conference within the
              Annual Meeting of the American  Institute of Chemical Engineers (AICHE) and
              will be focused  on identifying Food Engineering Research Priorities for the 
              21st Century.  Among the 16 oral sessions of specific  interest to BES are
              meetings on protein functionality in  foods, sensors in food processing,
              advances in fermentation  technology, aseptic processing, and food engineering 
              education.  A number of BES grantees, reviewers, and other  members of the BES
              "community" are active participants in  the meeting.  ***
