Abstract    :
                This project is a continuation of behavioral and demographic monitoring of
              golden lion tamarin monkeys in Poco das Antas Reserve, Brazil. The study
              population, now continuously monitored for 13 years, consists of about one
              third of the approximately 346 tamarins in the reserve.  Date and circumstances
              are recorded for every migration event in the population.  Maternity is
              recorded for each infant born into the study population and probable paternity
              determined using behavioral and molecular-genetic techniques.  Demographic data
              are entered into SPARKS, software designed to track genealogies and perform
              demographic analyses for captive populations.  One major objective of this
              research is to test hypotheses concerning the social and ecological
              circumstances that influence timing of natal dispersal in this cooperative
              breeding primate. Demographic analyses will also permit calculation of
              effective population size, an important measure for setting conservation goals
              for this endangered species.  In addition, we will apply newly available fecal
              endocrine assays to address questions concerning physiological suppression of
              fertility in subordinate females, endocrine correlates of forced and voluntary
              dispersal of individual tamarins, and of social dominance.  Finally, this
              research site, the study population, and the supporting databases will continue
              to serve as a center for Neotropical research.
