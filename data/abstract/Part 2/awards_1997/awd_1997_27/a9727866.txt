Abstract    :
              9727866  This project will organize and run a US-Brazil Workshop on Formal 
              Foundations of Software Systems at Tulane University, November 9-  12, 1997. 
              The workshop is a follow up to a similar activity held  in Rio de Janeiro,
              Brazil in May of 1997. The workshop will  further the establishment of
              collaborative research projects  between computer scientists in Brazil and
              their counterparts in  the United States. It will be composed of plenary
              sessions in two  broad areas: theory of programming language design and
              analysis  and formal tools for software verification, validation, and 
              refinement. In addition, there will be smaller sessions for the  presentation
              of detailed research interests, as well as interest-  group planning sessions
              for laying out common research goals.  There will be approximately twenty
              participants from each of  Brazil and the US, selected by a Program Committee
              of three  individuals from each country on the basis of position papers 
              stating their research interests and aims for collaboration.  One  outcome of
              the workshop will be a report to NSF giving the  results of an open discussion
              planned during the workshop  focusing on promising areas of potential
              collaboration and future  research, as well as ideas for promoting such
              collaborations in  the future. The workshop is jointly sponsored by CCR and CDA
              at  NSF and by the Brazilian counterpart agency, CNPq.  ***
