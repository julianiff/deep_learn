Abstract    :
              9727151  Edgington    Research will be undertaken in response to an Announcement
                of Opportunity (NSF 97-38)for Coastal Studies in the Great   Lakes.  This is
              a collaborative research project between   investigators from ten academic and
              government research   institutions.  The research is being conducted under the 
               auspices of the NSF Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP) program   and the NOAA
              Coastal Ocean Program.    This collaborative, 5-year research program will
              focus on   the importance of episodic events on nearshore-offshore   transport
              and subsequent ecological consequences. The study   seeks to 1) determine what
              processes control the cross-  margin (inshore to offshore) transport of
              biological,   chemical, and geological materials in the coastal margins of  
              the Great Lakes, and to 2) develop and test scientific   strategies for
              assessing, quantifying, and predicting the   impacts of multiple stresses both
              natural and anthropogenic,   in the Great Lakes or selected coastal
              sub-regions.    A tight coupling between contaminated sediments and   overlying
              water exists in lakes and coastal ecosystems  through the process of sediment
              resuspension. Satellite   observations in Lake Michigan illustrate an annually 
               recurrent episode of nearshore-offshore transport, a 10 km   wide plume of
              resuspended material extending over 200 km   along the southern shores of the
              lake. Preliminary evidence   indicates that this episodic event may be the
              major   mechanism for cross-margin sediment transport in Lake   Michigan.  This
              type of event impacts recycling of   biogeochemically important materials
              (BIMS), ecosystem   responses, cross-isobath transport in the Great Lakes. The 
               program results will be applicable to similar events in many   coastal areas. 
                This comprehensive, interdisciplinary study will implement   an integrated
              observational program and numerical modeling   effort to identify, quantify,
              and develop prediction tools   for the winter-spring resuspension event and to
              assess the   impact o f this event on the transport and transformation of  
              BIMS and on lake ecology.    This component of the study focuses on a variety
              of in situ   and laboratory techniques designed to look at the fate and  
              transformation of biogeochemically active particles in a  dynamic coastal
              system.
