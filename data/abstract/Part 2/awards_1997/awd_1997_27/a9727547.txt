Abstract    :
              9727547  Rayor  Earlier questions in tri-trophic theory focused on whether
              plants and insect predators function as mutualists or whether they have an
              antagonistic relationship as a result of negative effects of plant
              allelochemicals. However, it remains uncertain as to when these situations
              prevail. This research will determine when plant allelochemicals have a
              negative effect on insect predators by focusing on two of the major factors or
              conditions that affect insect predators: prey quality and prey quantity. No
              study has simultaneously addressed the effects of these factors on predator
              population growth and demography. The model system to be used in this research
              includes predatory wasps, caterpillars, and leaves that contain iridoid
              glycosides. The results of a series of experiments will determine when plant
              allelochemicals affect an insect predator, thus addressing the issue of
              mutualism vs. antagonism between plants and predators. Because current foraging
              theory and predator-prey population theory do not take into account the effects
              of plant allelochemicals on invertebrate predators, these reults will broaden
              understanding of a major constraint that most invertebrate predators must face.
              Furthermore, the results will indicate how prey species fare relative to others
              that differ in plant allelochemical concentrations.
