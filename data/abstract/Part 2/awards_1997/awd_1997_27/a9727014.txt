Abstract    :
              9727014  Werner  Most ecological studies are conducted on small spatial scales
              for short periods of time, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that we
              have little appreciation of the processes that influence ecological communities
              as we "scale-up." This project is an attempt to provide an understanding of
              such phenomena using amphibians as a model system. The research will continue a
              long-term data series on the distribution of 14 species of amphibians across 37
              ponds on the University of Michigan's E.S. George Reserve. The data series is
              unique in the time span involved, the number of ponds, and the number of
              species to be sampled. Specifically, this study will: 1) continue collection of
              the presence/absence data on 37 ponds for the next 5 years, 2) collect
              quantitative data on population densities of all amphibian species and their
              predators in these ponds, and 3) quantify habitat characteristics of the ponds
              surveyed. The data will be carefully archived and made available over the world
              wide web. These data will enable the investigators to address questions at the
              landscape scale and will be available for long-term assessments of
              environmental change. This is particularly important in light of the possible
              global decline of amphibians and the widespread teratologies reported in
              eastern and mid-western North American anuran populations.
