Abstract    :
              The  research  plan focuses on application of nondestructive  evaluation
              techniques to geotechnical engineering, combining  elements  of electrical and
              mechanical engineering with  the  rich heritage of geotechnical engineering. 
              The plan attacks  on two scales.  1.  Diagnostic acoustic emission analysis of 
              rock  failure  mechanisms  for  real  time  monitoring.   2.  Application  of 
              recursive system  identification  to  soils  excited   by  earthquake  strong 
              motion  for  analysis   of  nonlinear behavior and damping.  ***
