Abstract    :
              This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of 
              NCRI's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers 
              K-12 education institutions (including vocational technical schools),  public
              libraries and museums.  It provides partial support for 24 months to  connect
              an elementary school and a middle school to the Internet using  microwave
              technology. The wireless link will connect to a high school,  which has a fiber
              connection to the Internet.
