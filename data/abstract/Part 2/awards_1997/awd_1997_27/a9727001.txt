Abstract    :
                  9727001  Kirksey  The primary objectives of the workshop are to discuss the 
              importance of R&D within the design and construction industry; to  inform
              industry of the variety of NSF programs that can be used  as a basis for
              collaboration; and to present promising late-stage  NSF-funded research to
              industry representatives.    The workshop will result in an increased awareness
              of the  strategic importance of R&D within the design and construction 
              industry; specific industry recommendations on how to  commercialize, or at
              least collaborate on, promising NSF-funded  research; recommended actions to be
              taken to reduce R&D barriers  within the design and construction dialogue that
              would result in  more industry/university collaborations.  ***
