Abstract    :
                The electrocatalytic oxidation of small organic molecules forms the  focus of
              the research of Professor Korzeniewski at Texas Tech  University.  This
              project, supported by the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program, addresses
              the kinetics of formation of  intermediates in the electrocatalytic oxidation
              of methanol using  chromatography coupled with small volume electrolysis
              methods.  The  activation of water in these electrolytic processes is probed by
               monitoring the effect of the activation on the oscillatory  voltammetry of CO
              on the platinum electrode.  Information from  these studies will enable the
              improved design of direct methanol  fuel cells as well as the use of
              electrocatalysis for the  destruction of organic contaminants in groundwater.  
              A detailed understanding of the electrocatalytic oxidation of small  organic
              molecules is important to the development of fuel cells and  processes for
              remediation of contaminated groundwater sources.   This research project
              studies the mechanisms of these processes  using a combination of
              chromatographic detection of reaction  intermediates and voltammetric probes of
              electrode kinetics.
