Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT      OPP-9727899  FLANDERS, NICHOLAS  ARCTIC RESEARCH CONSORTIUM OF
              THE U.S.    The Arctic Research Consortium of the U.S. (ARCUS) proposes to
              renew the current Cooperative Agreement to support a variety of activities
              intended to enhance NSF arctic research programs.  ARCUS will continue to
              provide a mechanism for the science community to identify new research
              objectives, logistical requirements, and educational activities that will
              benefit both planning and implementation of NSF-supported science initiatives
              in the Arctic.  Specific activities include: science planning in the Arctic
              System Science (ARCSS) and Arctic Social Sciences (ASSP) Programs, information
              systems such as a brochure and newsletter for ARCSS and a World Wide Web page
              for dissemination of information to all those interested in arctic research,
              facilitation of science steering committee meetings for ARCSS and ASSP,
              development of arctic educational activities, and continued examination of
              logistics requirements for providing increased access for all researchers in
              the arctic.  The Cooperative Agreement with ARCUS provides a mechanism for
              enhancing community input to science planning in NSF and for disseminating the
              results of that planning to the science community.
