Abstract    :
                Education as social capital is commonly invoked as a justification for
              advocating more education for all.  According to this prevailing model, growth
              in educational attainment creates -human capital,+ which adds aggregate social
              value to society.  At the same time, however, it has been recognized that
              education has an important role as the central mechanism behind social
              stratification.  Here, education acts primarily as the chief agent of -social
              competition,+ in which there is no added social value to more education, but
              rather, education acts as an allocator, where increases in educational
              attainment simply lead to a continuous resorting into ranks.  These two models
              of the causal effect of education generate highly divergent predictive
              consequences of the value and price of education for society.  This research
              tests these competing models and unpacks the effects of formal education and
              the importance of individual performance, curriculum, and methods of learning
              on distinctive types of social outcomes.
