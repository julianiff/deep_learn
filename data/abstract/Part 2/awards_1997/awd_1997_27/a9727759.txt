Abstract    :
              9727759  Brahamsha  Certain marine unicellular cyanobacteria of the genus
              Synechococcus exhibit a mysterious type of swimming motility characterized by
              the absence of flagella and of any obvious organelle of motility.  In previous
              work, Dr. Brahamsha has obtained mutants impaired in swimming motility and has
              identified an abundant cell-surface polypeptide, SwmA, that is required for
              swimming.  The objectives of this project are two-fold: 1) to characterize
              existing motility mutants and isolate new ones and 2) to begin studies of
              SwmA's function.  This will be accomplished by combining genetic and
              biochemical approaches.  Studies of SwmA function will include cross-linking
              studies to determine the polypeptides it interacts with.  Characterization of
              the mutants will include isolating the genes responsible, determining their
              nucleotide sequences, and localizing their products in Synechococcus cells. 
              These studies should provide insights not only into the mechanism of this
              unique type of prokaryotic motility but also into the fundamental question of
              how organisms convert chemical energy into motion.
