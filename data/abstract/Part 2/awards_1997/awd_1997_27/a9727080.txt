Abstract    :
              This project completes an alternative route to information on the distribution
              of interstellar cosmic rays, complementing efforts of the only existing
              approach.  The existing method involves solar modulation and shock acceleration
              of energetic charged particles at/interior to the solar wind termination shock,
              while the new approach utilizes the energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) produced
              from interacting charged particles and local interstellar medium exterior to
              the termination shock.  The investigators are:  (1) compiling relevant cross
              sections for ENA production and extinction, and all characterizing parameters
              of the solar wind and interstellar gas; (2) coding a three-dimensional computer
              program simulating ENA flux at any vantage point, and under any heliospheric
              and interstellar conditions, and (3) developing an iterative process for
              optimizing the parameters characterizing the spatial and energy distribution of
              cosmic rays at the termination shock.  The research takes a huge step forward
              in searching for the origins of cosmic rays, as well as propagation of charged
              particles in and out of the solar wind influence.
