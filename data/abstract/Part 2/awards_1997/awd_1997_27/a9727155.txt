Abstract    :
                The purpose of this award is to support further development  the Antarctic
              Geologic Database (AGD), an on-line database  for geologic specimens collected
              in Antarctica by members of  the U.S. geologic community, and to provide for
              the rescue  of Antarctic geologic collections that are at risk of being  lost.
              This award, from the Office of Polar Programs of the  National Science
              Foundation, provides funds for a computer  system to act as the server for the
              database, for personnel  costs associated with improving, updating, and running
              the  database, and for rescue of at-risk collections.    A prototype of the AGD
              was designed as part of a Small Grant  for Exploratory Research. This initial
              version is now on-  line and available for use (http://polestar.mps.ohio 
              state.edu/AGDcgibin/Search_agd1.pm). It was tested by 15  geologists with
              varying specialties, and comments from the  Antarctic geologic community have
              now been solicited.  Continuing interaction with the community will ensure 
              development of a useful database.    The database allows a user to search for
              rock samples by  geographic area, geologic age, rock type, formation or unit, 
              fossil or mineral content, collection purpose, and by whom  and when the
              collection was made. It informs the user what  analyses have been carried out,
              where those results are  published, and also any possible unpublished results
              and  their location and availability. It can provide a great  variety of
              descriptive information, including anecdotal  field observations. Most
              importantly, the Database records  where the rocks are currently stored, and
              the name and  address of the collector or contact person.
