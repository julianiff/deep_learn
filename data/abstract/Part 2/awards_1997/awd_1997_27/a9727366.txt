Abstract    :
              Dr. Sen is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic  
              Chemistry Program to study the mechanisms of homogeneous catalysts.  He   has
              developed a rhodium chloride based catalytic system that is capable   of the
              selective oxidation of methane to methanol or acetic acid in the   presence of
              oxygen and carbon monoxide.  Further, this system will   preferentially cleave
              carbon-carbon bond of higher alkanes to produce   methanol or acetic acid.  A
              second catalytic system based upon copper   chloride and palladium is able to
              oxidize the carbon-hydrogen and   carbon-carbon cleavage products of alkanes at
              rates comparable to   commercially utilized processes.  The PI has proposed to
              undertake a   detailed kinetic and mechanistic study of the bimetallic
              catalytic   system.  Key issues to be addressed in this investigation are the
              roles   of carbon monoxide and water in the catalytic cycle and the nature of  
              carbon-hydrogen and carbon-carbon bonds upon oxidation products.    Specific
              methodologies will include kinetic isotope effect studies and   the design and
              fabrication of a custom flow reactor.  Selective partial oxidation chemistry is
              one of the most actively   explored fields in the US chemical industry.  The
              conversion of   hydrocarbons to commercially valuable feedstock materials such
              as   alcohols and carboxylic acids is commercially important.  The development 
               of new catalysts to perform this function is of great practical   importance
              due to the value-added nature of the process.
