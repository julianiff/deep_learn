Title: Quantum 1/f Noise and Limitations of All-Optical
              2-D Spectral-Holographic TDM Technology with Quantum Well
              Devices



Abstract

This proposal is to refine and simplify the quantum
              1/f noise theory developed previously for applications to HFETs and FETs, and
              to further develop the connection between the coherent and conventional quantum
              1/f effects in microstructures and devices.  This is a revised version from the
              original proposal with the "Limitation of All-Optical 2-D Spectral-Holographic
              TDM" portion deleted for a limited funding.
