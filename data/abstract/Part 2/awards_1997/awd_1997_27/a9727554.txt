Abstract    :
              Papitashvili abstract    The investigators will develop an electromagnetic model
              of ionospheric conductivity at high latitudes at both the northern and southern
              hemispheres for variable interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions.  Two
              existing IMF-dependent models - the Geomagnetic Linear Regression model and the
              Spherical Harmonic Electric Field model derived from spacecraft data - will be
              used together with the Spherical Harmonic Field-aligned Current model for
              variable IMF, which is now under development.  The major new element in the
              proposed research is a statistical model of ionospheric conductivity for
              variable IMF and solar wind conditions.  This model differs from available
              statistical ionospheric conductivity models and will provide additional insight
              and better understanding of the ionospheric convection responses on the
              large-scale interaction of the solar wind with Earth's magnetosphere.  The
              model can also be used for calibration purposes between a variety of
              satellite-based, radar, and ground magnetometer models of the ionospheric
              potential and convection.  These models are important elements in improving
              predictive capabilities for space weather.
