Abstract    :
              9727333  Grassl  A major international scientific conference will be convened 
              to  review the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), the  research  component
              of the World Climate Program (WCP).  Conference  participants will include
              scientists from the United States  and  other countries involved in the WCRP
              and its component  research  projects; science administrators involved in
              management and  oversight of the WCRP and its projects; and users of the 
              scientific  results of the WCRP and its projects.  The conference will  review 
              scientific progress of the WCRP and its projects in  comparison with  the
              original objectives and plans for the WCRP and its  projects and  to determine
              if these objectives and plans should be updated  or  otherwise modified.  The
              conference will prepare  recommendations  for such updating and/or modification
              for consideration by  the  scientific community, the international sponsors of
              the  WCRP, and  research funding agencies.  The conference will also develop 
              input  for the Second Intergovernmental Meeting on the WCP expected  to be 
              convened sometime in 1998.  ***
