Abstract    :
                Fourth International Conference on Constitutive Laws for          Engineering
              Materials: Theory and Application                                  In 
              Mechanics of Materials, constitutive equations  are  the  mathematical 
              descriptions of material deformation  behavior  and  are needed in analytical
              and numerical stress analyses.  Different  materials have different
              constitutive  equations.  Research  in  constitutive equations is  usually 
              associated  with  certain fields such as mechanical or civil engineering  or 
              others.  Three previous conferences at the University of  Arizona  had
              constitutive equations of nearly all  materials  used  in  engineering
              applications as a theme.  A  follow-up  conference  is planned for summer of
              1999 on the  campus  of  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  This date also
              marks  the  25th  anniversary  of  a workshop on Inelastic  Constitutive 
              Equations  held at RPI and sponsored by the Solid  Mechanics  Program of NSF. 
              The proceedings of this workshop will serve  as a gage for measuring progress. 
              Support is sought for the  travel  expenses of invited speakers, graduate
              students  and  post-doctoral  associates,  and  for  publication   of   the 
              proceedings.   A  separate budget financed  by  registration  fees   covers  
              other   expenses  including   announcements,  preparation and conference
              organization.
