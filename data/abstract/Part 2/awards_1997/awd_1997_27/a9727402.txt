Abstract    :
               This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              Case Western Reserve University. The project studies the treatment seeking
              process for tuberculosis (TB) among relatively understudied Baganda women in
              Uganda.  It explores the variation in the role of a patient's social network,
              across urban and rural settings, in seeking treatment.  The project will
              interview one hundred women who have been diagnosed with TB from two sites, an
              urban TB clinic and a rural health clinic.  Subjects will be interviewed three
              times over six months using open-ended and semi-structured survey instruments
              to determine symptom labeling, behavioral alterations, consultation with
              friends and relatives and how they sought treatment from professional care
              givers, and their reaction to situations where the advice of traditional
              care-givers contradicts that of bio-medical providers.  The study will
              contribute to our knowledge of the interaction between social network structure
              and functioning in medical treatment-seeking for this chronic illness. The
              advance in our understanding of general principles of how and why people seek
              and adhere to medical advice will be important in developing programs of health
              improvement. The project also increases our expertise about this important
              region of the world.
