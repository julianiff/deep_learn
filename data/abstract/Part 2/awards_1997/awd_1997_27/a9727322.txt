Abstract    :
               This project (consisting of two collaborative awards, this and 9807373 to
              Roberta Baer at the University of South Florida) continues a line of research
              using the cultural consensus model, a statistical technique for assessing the
              degree of homogeneity in the underlying models of respondents from a local
              community or cultural population, in this case of specific illnesses (diabetes,
              AIDS, the common cold) used by Latin American respondents.  The research will
              focus on the systematic examination of sources of intracultural variation, in
              particular on the effect of specialized knowledge or personal experience of a
              specific disease.  This research builds on and expands earlier work done on
              9204555 by collecting new samples for comparison to previously collected
              samples.  With this new data it will be possible to explore variation in
              beliefs across diverse groups within and across sites.  Three hypotheses will
              be tested: that differences in beliefs are due to differences in `experience`
              or exposure to the illness in the general community; that beliefs about illness
              will vary by whether the individual respondent has had the illness; and that
              the differences in belief structure between professionally trained and lay
              respondents will be greater than differences from nationality or culture. The
              project will collect new data about AIDS and the common cold from six sample
              populations in Guatemala, Mexico and south Texas, and from diabetics and
              physicians in Guadalajara, Mexico and south Texas.  In addition some simulation
              work will be done to assess the effects of response bias and skewed answer keys
              on consensus estimates.   The consensus model brings rigor to the description
              of community beliefs by assessing the concordance or homogeneity across
              informant' responses to a series of related questions and proving estimates of
              normative answers, similar to that which a psychometrician might apply to
              analyzing the reliability of test items.
