Abstract    :
                  9727025    Olmstead       Dr. Olmstead's research will address a problem
              that has confounded botanists for several hundred years: the pattern of early
              diversification of flowering plants (angiosperms).  This research project
              should help us to understand what these plants may have looked like and what
              course of evolution in floral and vegetative features may have taken.  In many
              respects this is the greatest question in flowering plant systematics.  Three
              prior DNA-based studies examining individual genes have yielded conflicting
              results or have been unable to resolve relationships among the extant
              representatives of lineages that were diverged approximately 100 million years
              ago.  The experimental approach will be to determine DNA sequences for 17
              chloroplast genes totaling approximately 13,000 nucleotides for each of
              approximately fifty plant species chosen to represent previously identified
              critical lineages of the basal angiosperms.  This approach will provide a
              three-fold increase in the data currently available to help solve the problem
              and should be sufficient to produce resolution.  Much of the required material
              for the research has already been gathered, and additional sampling will be
              achieved by cooperation with other researchers and curators at botanical
              gardens.
