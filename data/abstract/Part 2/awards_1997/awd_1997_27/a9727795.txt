Abstract    :
              9727795  Dighton  Mycorrhizal fungi are able to form a biological bridge between
              two resource patches. Nutrients and carbon can then be translocated between
              patches by the fungi. This SGER research will use new technology, Fourier
              Transform Infrared Radiometry (FTIR) to (1) determine the cascade of
              decomposition products in response to fungal enzymes on resource islands with
              or without fungal bridges, and (2) assess if decomposition products from
              different plant materials can be determined qualitatively with this technique.
              This research has direct application for linking microbial diversity in the
              soil with ecosystem function through the process of decomposition. This will be
              the first attempt to use FTIR technology to link structure and function in soil
              microbial ecology.
