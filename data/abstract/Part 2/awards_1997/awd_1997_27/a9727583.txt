Abstract    :
              9727583  Bleiler       This award will provide partial support for speakers and
              others  at semiannual conferences in the series known as the ``Cascade Topology
               Seminar,'' over a three-year period beginning in 1998.  These conferences 
              will be held at various universities in the northwestern United States  and
              southwestern Canada.  Among institutions currently active are the  University
              of British Columbia, University of California-Berkeley,  University of
              Nevada-Reno, University of Oregon, University of Puget  Sound, University of
              Washington, Boise State University, Oregon State  University, and Portland
              State University.  Typically there will be half  a dozen principal speakers on
              topics ranging widely over geometry and  topology, both algebraic and
              geometric, the majority from outside these  institutions, and more than fifty
              participants altogether, roughly  half of them faculty and half of them
              graduate students, as well as  an occasional undergraduate student. 
              Participation by younger  mathematicians, by women, and by underrepresented
              minorities is encouraged,  the first two with notable success.  Other sources
              of financial support  include the host institutions in each case and, in the
              case of the  conferences held in Canada, Canadian sources, which entirely
              supplant  the National Science Foundation.  ***
