Abstract    :
              9727783  Belytschko  The equipment grant enables the researchers at Northwestern
               University to use much larger three-dimensional models than  possible so far,
              fundamentally changing the qualitative  nature of problems solved, and leading
              to new breakthroughs.  The new equipment also allows to further exploit 
              parallelization tools in areas includingmeshless methods,  multiple scale
              methods for complex structures and  manufacturing processes, enhanced
              tribological performance,  mechanics of geomaterials, fracture and fatigue and
              phase  tranformations.  ***
