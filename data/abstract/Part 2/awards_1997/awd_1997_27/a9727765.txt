Abstract    :
                            The identity of individual segments in the fruit fly, Drosophila
              melanogaster, is regulated by the expression of the homeotic genes within
              specific segments. These homeotic genes encode transcription factors that
              regulate segment specific expression of other morphogenetic genes. Homologs of
              many Drosophila homeotic genes have been identified throughout much of the
              animal kingdom, where they are often expressed in analogous portions of the
              embryonic body plan. Analysis of the roles of the Drosophila homeotlc genes and
              of the interrelationships among these genes during Drosophila embryology is
              likely to provide important developmental principles involved generally in
              animal embryology. The cap'n'collar (cnc) gene of Drosophila is a homeotic gene
              that is important in defining the identity of the mandibular and labral
              segments during embryonic development. Unlike most other homeotic genes which
              encode monomeric DNA-binding proteins, cnc is unique in encoding a subunit of a
              dimeric bZIP transcription factor. The research proposed here will continue the
              analysis of the role of this gene in Drosophila development, of the Dlochemical
              mechanisms of its function and of its interaction with the Drosophila bZIP
              gene, mat2. In particular, this study will characterize the developmental
              function of mat2 by mutational analysis and ectopic expression, investigate the
              ability of the CNC protein to form functional heterodimers with other
              Drosophila bZIP proteins, identify the enhancer regions controlling cnc spatial
              expression and investigate the role of cnc in oogenesis. This study will also
              isolate and characterize cnc-like genes from zebrafish, in order to elucidate
              whether the homeotlc function of cnc is evolutionarily conserved to
              vertebrates.
