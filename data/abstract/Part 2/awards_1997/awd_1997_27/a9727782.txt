Abstract    :
              9727782  Dutta  The critical CAD representation issue where existing CAD 
              systems fail is that it is necessary to capture the interior 
              heterogeneity/density/gradation information in addition to  the outer geometry
              of the component being described. The  project integrates concepts from
              conventional r-sets used  currently in solid modeling, fiber fundles from
              differential  geometry, and approaches from continuum mechanics to address 
              this problem. The developments directly influence the  `layered-manufacturing'
              approaches and have a significant  impact on medical imaging and satellite
              image processing  processes.  ***
