Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9727099  EVASHWICK    This is a 2-year, $50,000 Research
              Opportunities Award (ROA) to California State University Long Beach (RUI/PUI),
              to conduct research in conjunction with the Industry University Cooperative
              Research Center (IUCRC) for Health Management.  The overall goals are to
              describe the extent to which various wellness, outreach and long-term care
              services are offered by integrated healthcare delivery systems, and to
              explicate how these services function as an integral part of the  continuum of
              care.  The study involves two activities: (1) analyzing secondary data
              collected on the American Hospital Association Annual Survey to develop a
              national profile of continuum services at the hospital, health system, and
              network levels, and (2) conducting interviews with 10-12 selected hospitals and
              healthcare systems about operational issues pertaining specifically to service
              integration.  The project will examine the involvement of 27 wellness,
              outreach, and long-term care services in integrated healthcare delivery
              systems.
