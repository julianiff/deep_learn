Abstract    :
               The migration of indigenous people between Mexico and the US has increased
              since the 1980s.  The traditional pattern of male migrants has become more
              complex, with gender becoming more significant as a factor in migration.  This
              project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from the
              University of Michigan, studying migrants from the Oaxacan town of Yalalag to
              Los Angeles.  As many as 52% of the recent migrants from the town currently
              living in LA are female.  The student will investigate the cultural meaning of
              transmigration through intensive interviewing of a sample of 100 households,
              open-ended interviews, participant observation, a household survey in Oaxaca
              and also participant observation and interviews in LA.  The focus of the
              project is on the changes in gender roles attributable to migration as well as
              transmigratory information and capital flows.  The project will analyze the
              identity of migrants as not simply varying along a linear progression from
              `traditional` to `modern` but rather on a more complex and nuanced blend of
              local Yalalag, national Mexican, local southern Californian and national US
              identities. The research will advance our understanding of the lived experience
              of migrants and will be useful to policy makers who must deal with migration,
              and will contribute to the training of a young social scientist.
