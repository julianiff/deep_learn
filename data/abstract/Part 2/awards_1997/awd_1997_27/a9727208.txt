              Title: Novel photon detectors based on the photo-induced stress of
              semiconductor micromechanical devices    Abstract    The proposal is to use
              photo-induced stress in cantilevers fabricated from narrow-gap semiconductors
              as a means of detecting IR photons.  Either optical or capacitance sensing of
              the cantilever deflection can be used as a measure of the IR signal. The work
              has important potential of being extended to arrays of cantilever-based
              detectors.
