Abstract    :
                    Computers have become indispensable in much of current biology, in their 
              roles of acquiring, processing, visualizing, and storing complex four- 
              dimensional (space & time) data. However, the final stage in biological 
              research is going from acquired, processed, and stored data to new  biological
              knowledge. Computerized visualization is used in this stage, but  there has
              been less development of computerized reasoning tools that can  complement the
              biologist's toolkit.     This project is developing  discovery tools - in the
              form of novel algorithms and software - to deal  with the complex 4D data of
              biological imaging. These tools will help  detect subtle spatio-temporal
              patterns (i.e., non-randomness) that would be  difficult to notice with
              standard means of analysis. The main technique is  based on permutation tests,
              which have been applied widely in other  sciences but not in biological
              imaging. The challenge is to design  algorithms to handle the specific problems
              posed by typical imaging data.
