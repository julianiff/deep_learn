Abstract    :
              This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              the University of New Mexico.  The student will conduct ethnographic research
              in a forested area of Paraguay, among the Ache Indians. The research will
              evaluate models of costs and benefits of social foraging, to test hypotheses
              concerning gender, the role of variance in food intake and other factors, on
              local residential group size and composition.  Methods include participant
              observation, a sample survey of individuals, focal follows on foraging and
              hunting expeditions, and measurement of food output.  This research will
              provide theoretically significant data on how and why people hunt in this
              environment which will be useful in improving our understanding of hunting as a
              mode of life in general.  There are ever fewer opportunities for empirical
              research on real-life hunting societies.  In addition the project will
              contribute to the training of a young social scientist, and add to our
              knowledge about this important region of the world.
