Abstract    :
              9727589  Bebout    This grant provides two-years partial salary support  for the
              stable isotope/Noble gas mass spectroscopy  laboratory technician at Lehigh
              University.  This is a  Phase II technician support grant under the 
              Instrumentation and Facilities (IF) Program and  follows three years of Phase I
              support (EAR-9406135).  The isotope geochemistry technician at Lehigh 
              University, Dr. Bruce Idleman, provides support for  both the 40Ar/39Ar
              geochronology lab and the stable  isotope geochemistry lab under the directions
              of Dr.  Peter Zeitler and Dr. Gray Bebout, respectively. Under  Phase I
              support, Dr. Idleman brought on-line a new  laser system for both step-wise
              heating and direct  laser ablation of samples for 40Ar/39Ar dating and has 
              constructed a novel extraction line for preparing  samples for nitrogen
              isotopic analysis.  As a result,  these labs offer some unique analytical
              methodologies  including feldspar thermochronology and nitrogen  isotopic
              analyses of N2 extracted from igneous phases  that are now available to outside
              members of the  community.  Continued support of this technical  position will
              allow for expanded collaborative work  with outside investigators using these
              newly developed  geochronologic and stable isotopic techniques and will 
              support inhouse research in tectonics, fluid/crust  interactions, igneous
              petrogenesis and thermal  evolution of the crust.  ***
