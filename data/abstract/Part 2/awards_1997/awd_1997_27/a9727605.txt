Abstract    :
                An understanding of the genetic and developmental influences on variation in
              body size is fundamental to a series of issues in primate and human evolution. 
              Size change is frequently observed within lineages and also has myriad effects
              on the physiology, life history and ecology of organisms. Recent work has
              demonstrated the central role of the systemic growth hormones insulin-like
              growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and growth hormone-binding protein (GH-BP) in
              regulating overall growth rates and terminal body size in primates and other
              mammals.  There is also evidence that these systemic growth hormones are
              implicated in the variation in growth patterning frequently observed in
              lineages undergoing size diversification.    In this project, we will test the
              hypothesis that serum IGF-1 and GH-BP levels are significantly correlated with
              growth rates and overall body size variation within and between three species
              of macaque monkeys.  The relationships will be tested in small (Macaca
              fascicularis), medium (M. mulatta) and large (M. nemestrina) macaque males of
              known age and body weight betweeen approximately three and eight years of age,
              a period of high growth rate and marked size increase.  These data will
              comprise the first such information collected for an interspecific series of
              primates, and will contribute to our understanding of the connections between
              micro- and macroevolutionary size change in higher primate and human evolution.
