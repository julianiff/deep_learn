                      Abstract  Proposal #9727428  RUI: Learning and Development     
              Experiences early in life can have profound effects on both  normal and
              abnormal behavior later in life.  The aim of the  project is to develop a model
              system for studies of the  roles of experience in behavioral development.  The
              system  in which these processes are analyzed is the transition from  dependent
              to independent feeding in ring doves.  The  specific ways in which experience
              with different foods,  parental interaction, and observing other birds
              influence  the development of this response are studied.  Additionally,  we are
              able to investigate the neural changes that underlie  the behavioral
              development.  These studies are leading to  the development of a framework in
              which the roles of  experience in the development of any behavior can be 
              analyzed.    How to get new responses to occur is an important aspect of  many
              human activities.  Parents want to provide experiences  for their children that
              help them to develop adaptively.  Teachers want their pupils to acquire new
              repertoires.  Therapists try to induce new and more adaptive behaviors in 
              their clients and businesses may wish to promote creative  problem solving in
              their employees.  Because there are some  general principles about how new
              behaviors emerge, the  results obtained by analyzing this model system can be 
              applied in a wide range of practical settings.
