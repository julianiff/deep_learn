Abstract    :
              This research focuses on thermally and photochemically induced electron  
              transfer and electrophilic addition reactions in solid matrices.   X-ray  
              diffraction analysis of donor-acceptor doped solid matrices will be used   to
              correlate matrix structure and its changes with dopant reactivity in   order to
              develop a database useful in achieving reaction control,   enhancing charge
              separation, and increasing reaction product lifetime.     Correlating solid
              state structural changes with observed reactivity   offers graduate and
              postdoctoral students a unique opportunity to become   familiar with modern
              fast reaction and structural analysis techniques.  With this Renewal, the
              Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   supports Professor Kochi's
              studies of donor-acceptor reactivity in solid   matrices.   Professor Kochi
              will focus his research on correlating the   structural changes that occur in
              the matrix with donor-acceptor   reactivity and product stability in order to
              develop the database needed   to utilize the host matrix as a means to control
              reactivity in the solid   state.   Graduate and postdoctoral students carrying
              out the experiments   will gain experience in modern fast reaction techniques
              and x-ray   structural analysis.
