Abstract    :
              9727141  Sharp    This award provides 60% of the funding required for the
              acquisition  of a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer with differential 
              pumping and elemental analyzer interface, and UV-CO2 laser  microsampling and
              optical micropositioning systems. The equipment  is to be installed in the
              Department of Earth and Planetary  Sciences at the University of New Mexico.
              The University of New  Mexico is committed to providing the remaining 40%
              funding required  for this acquisition. The instrumental system will be
              primarily  used in the Principal Investigator's research in paleoclimatology 
              and will be open to colleagues at the University of New Mexico and  elsewhere.
              It is anticipated that the instrument will be heavily  used by students and
              will play an integral role at the University  of New Mexico in the training of
              graduate and undergraduate  students in modern analytical methods.  ***
