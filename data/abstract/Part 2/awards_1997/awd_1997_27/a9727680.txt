Abstract    :
              This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the University of   Texas
              at Austin supports the research of Professor Jason B. Shear.  The   theme of
              the research is ultraviolet fluorescence detection of biological  
              chromophores.  The work investigates the mechanisms and extent of  
              multiphoton-excited degradation of monoamine neurotransmitters excited   using
              different numbers of photons of different characteristic   wavelengths. 
              Comparisons are made of the photodestruction quantum yields   for three-photon
              excitation of neurotransmitters using a modelocked   titanium:sapphire laser in
              the near-infrared wavelength range, and for   two-photon excitation using a
              frequency doubled titanium:sapphire laser.    Sources of background in both
              two- and three-photon excited fluorescence   measurements are evaluated and
              used in combination with the   photodestruction measurements to optimize
              ultraviolet fluorescence   detection of natively fluorescent neurotransmitters
              analyzed with   capillary electrophoresis.  The research will advance efforts
              toward quantitative measurement of   neuronal chemistry at the subcellular
              level.  Improved detectability of a   variety of natively fluorescent
              neurotransmitters will provide new   capabilities for characterizing
              fundamental mechanisms of chemical   signalling between cells.
