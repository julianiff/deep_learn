This award primarily provides funds for travel to an
              international conference.  The Conference on Stochastic Processes and their
              Applications will be held July 5-11, 1998, at Oregon State University.  This
              conference on probability is devoted to the study of random processes and their
              applications to other disciplines.  The conference is expected to attract
              participants from about twenty countries.
