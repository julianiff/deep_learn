Abstract    :
              9727098  Rodriguez    This proposed investigation will examine how video can be
              used as a medium to enhance both analytic research and teachers' professional
              development.  In particular, this project will examine the potential of
              video-based instructional materials to influence students' willingness to adopt
              unfamiliar ideas related to constructivism and multiculturalism. The context
              for this study is a preservice teacher education program at the University of 
              Wisconsin-Madison. To aid his students' preparation as educators, the
              investigator plans to use constructivist pedagogy in the multiculturalism
              course he offers as part of this academic program. In addition, the
              investigator will assess the potential capability of video case studies to
              serve as an analytic medium for understanding students' conceptual evolution on
              these topics. These two objectives will be accomplished through (1) studying
              how leading scholars in education use video as a means of professional
              development and of research, and (2) preparing a publication synthesizing and
              disseminating these results.  ***
