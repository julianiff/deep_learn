Abstract    :
              This research focuses on the synthesis and characterization of molecules,  
              called photoacids, that exhibit changes in acid-base properties on   optical
              excitation.   Synthetic methodologies will be developed to   achieve molecules
              whose photoacidity can be tailored thereby providing   new methods for studies
              of proton transfer reactions and novel   polymerization catalysts.  The
              research introduces graduate and   postdoctoral students to new concepts in
              acid-base chemistry and   kinetics, and to the methodologies to examine these
              transient effects.  With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program   supports the research of Professor Laren Tolbert of the School of  
              Chemistry and Biochemistry at Georgia Institute of Technology.     Professor
              Tolbert will focus his research efforts on the synthesis and   excited state
              chemistry of molecules, called photoacids, whose acid-base   properties change
              on optical excitation.   These molecules, which can   exhibit immense, but
              transient, changes in acid-base properties, provide   new methods to study
              acid-base chemistry, and novel approaches to   photoactivated, polymerization
              catalysts.   Through Professor Tolbert's   research, graduate and postdoctoral
              students will be exposed to new   concepts in acid-base chemistry, and the
              methodology to examine these   transient effects.
