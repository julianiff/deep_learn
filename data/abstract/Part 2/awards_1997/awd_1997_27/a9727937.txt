Abstract    :
              PI:  Thomas C. Bruice  9727937  Bruice  A promising approach to the question of
              the contribution of the force field of the enzyme structure to the rate of the
              enzymatic reaction involves the use of a combined quantum mechanical and
              molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methodology, to simulate the minimum energy
              surfaces, reaction pathways and transition state structures.  The choice of
              enzymes for investigation is based on simplicity of the reactions catalyzed, 
              high resolution of the necessary crystal structures, and relatively small size
              of the proteins themselves.  Using a simple organic model for the enzymatic
              reaction, minimum energy reaction profiles will be computed by both
              semiempirical and ab initio methods in both the gas phase and polar dielectric.
               Comparison of semiempirical and ab initio structures and energies must be
              favorable in order to have confidence in the use of any particular
              semiempirical method to represent QM atoms in the QM/MM program.    By
              characterizing the structural, electronic and energetic effects that an enzyme
              has on the intrinsic chemical properties of the reacting species, it is hoped
              that the project will provide answers to the question of why enzymes are such
              excellent catalysts.  Particularly, this approach enables the evaluation of the
              environmental effects due to the enzyme on the energetics of an enzyme
              catalyzed reaction.
