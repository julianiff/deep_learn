Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9727123  Jan D. Miller    "Surface Characterization of Adsorption
              and Interfacial Reactions-II," is the title of the proposed Engineering
              Foundation Conference.  This conference will be sequel to the successful 1994
              conference of the same title and focus.    Like the previous conference,
              international participation of well-organized researchers is expected.  In
              particular, numerous researchers from the pacific Rim, South America, and
              Europe have already demonstrated an interest in participating in the
              conference.    The Conference has multiple objectives.  The first objective is
              to convene a truly multi-disciplinary group of top quality researchers from
              academia, industry and government interested in the advancement of  the
              understanding of surface characterization of adsorption and interfacial
              reactions.  The second objective is to provide a broad-based forum for these
              researchers to aid in cross-fertilization of current findings and ideas.    NSF
              support is requested for transportation, lodging, and registration costs of
              invited speakers from the United States.  It should be noted that this support
              will augment substantial support already committed by industrial sponsors of 
              the Conference. The Engineering Foundation, and the U.S. Japan/Air Force Office
              of  Scientific Research.  ***
