Abstract    :
                  9727667  Beyerlein    This project entitled Glow Discharge 
              Atomization/ExcitationAonization Sources involves a series of  studies to
              further the development and implementation of radio  frequency glow discharge
              (rf-GD) devices as spectrochemical  sources for direct solids analysis to
              include nonconductive  materials such as glasses, ceramics, and polymers, by
              atomic  emission and mass spectrometries.  Areas of investigation  include the
              implementation of fundamental diagnostic techniques  for real-time monitoring
              of rf-GD  atomization/excitation/ionization conditions, where e.g., real-  time
              in situ monitoring of sputtered crater depth will be  accomplished with a laser
              confocal displacement apparatus  mounted within the discharge source.  Also,
              the addition of  helium to the normal argon discharge will be studied as a
              means  of providing enhanced depth resolution and sensitivity for hard- 
              to-excite/ionize elements.  %%%  Radio frequency glow discharge sources hold
              promise in the  analysis of materials such as polymers, ceramics and glasses, 
              with the potential for performing rapid bulk and depth-resolved  elemental
              analysis of films, coatings and membrane materials.  The further development
              and optimization of these analytical  tools will provide significant advantages
              over present analysis  capabilities in fields of practical applications that
              include  biotechnology, industrial process control, and waste 
              characterization.  ***
