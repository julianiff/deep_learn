Abstract    :
              The Wilcox Solar Observatory (at Stanford University) continues its resourceful
              investigations of evolving solar conditions.  Investigators analyze the
              gathered data for further understanding of the solar cycle and solar activity
              causes, solar interior conditions, interactions between motions and magnetic
              field, temporal evolution of coronal magnetic structure and both magnetic and
              velocity fields in the photosphere, prediction of solar wind CME features'
              size/importance, and the large scale structure of the heliosphere.  The
              Observatory is upgrading and replacing some of its instrumentation.
