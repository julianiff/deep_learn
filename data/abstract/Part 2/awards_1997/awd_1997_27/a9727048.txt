Abstract    :
              Bowen  9727048      This research will use molecular genetic technology to
              investigate the  limits of dispersal for reef fishes among the four primary
              reef habitats of  the tropical Atlantic: Caribbean Sea, Brazil, mid-Atlantic
              ridge (Ascension  Island), and Gulf of Guinea (West Africa).  DNA sequences
              will be compared  among populations of French angelfish (Pomacanthus paru),
              blackbar  squirrelfish (Myripristis jacobus) and five other species to track
              patterns  of colonization and gene flow across the Atlantic Ocean.    Reef fish
              don't move much as adults, so dispersal is accomplished primarily  by drifting
              eggs and larvae.  How far can reef fish disperse as larvae?  This question is
              of fundamental importance for understanding the natural  recolonization of reef
              habitats damaged by anthropogenic factors.  Reef  habitats in Brazil and the
              Caribbean Sea are separated by 2000 kms of muddy  coastline (between the
              Orinoco and Amazon River basins).  West Atlantic  reefs are separated from
              African reefs by 4000 kms of open ocean.  Population genetic assessments at
              these two geographic scales should resolve  the limitations of reef fish
              dispersal.  A central focus of this research is  the role of Ascension Island
              on the mid-Atlantic ridge in facilitating  colonization between east and west
              Atlantic. If Ascension Island functions  as a stepping stone for colonization
              across the Atlantic, then this oceanic  island may play a substantial (and
              previously unrecognized) role in  enhancing the biodiversity of West Atlantic
              reef habitats.
