Abstract    :
              9727574  Zia  This is a renewal grant to two researchers to continue their 
              program on driven diffusive systems: complex behavior of  interacting
              many-particle systems which are driven into  steady states far from thermal
              equilibrium.  A combination  of techniques will be used to study these systems
              including  exact solutions and simulations on discrete lattice models,  as well
              as analytic techniques on continuum field theories.  These systems are relevant
              to such diverse applications as  surface/crystal growth, intercalation,
              granular materials,  fracture dynamics, gel electrophoresis, diffusion in
              complex  environments, traffic flow, etc.    The first part of this grant will
              focus on collective  behavior in driven diffusive lattice gases.  While the 
              simplest models are reasonably well understood, many of  their generalizations,
              e.g., skew boundary conditions,  anisotropic interactions, extreme aspect
              ratios or charge  asymmetries, present unanticipated challenges.  The second 
              part will focus on new directions.  These include random  walks in a dynamic
              background; the study of histograms (full  distributions) of various
              observables and the formulation of  systematic Grassmannian field theories for
              systems with  strict volume constraints; and, finally, fundamental issues  in
              the statistical mechanics of non-equilibrium steady  states.  %%%  This is a
