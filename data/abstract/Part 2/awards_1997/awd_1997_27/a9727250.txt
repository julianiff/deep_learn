Abstract    :
               This project involves the research of a cultural anthropologist from Princeton
              University, studying how Tibetan women use traditional Tibetan medicine as a
              means of cultural revitalization under conditions of state-directed Sinicized
              modernization.  Specifically, it explores the extent to which women associate
              use of Tibetan medicine for reproductive and gynecological disorders with
              efforts to ensure the survival of Tibetan culture in the face of Chinese
              hegemonic practices.  The work will focus on six months of data collection in
              the women's ward of a health facility in Lhasa where the idioms used by women
              for discussing biological, social, political and cultural discontent are drawn
              from traditional Tibetan epistemologies concerning the body, the nature of
              suffering, and the relation between ethics, biology, and cultural identity. The
              investigator will interview patients and families about their diseases,
              treatments, and other factors they consider relevant to their conditions. 
              Physicians as well as traditional healers will be interviewed and observed as
              they deal with patients. The project will provide data on this relatively
              unknown area of women's health in Tibet, will advance our understanding of the
              links between ethnic revitalization and ethnomedicine in the important area of
              the world.
