Abstract    :
              9727663  Graedel  The PI proposes Shared Funding for the Gordon Research
              Conference  on Industrial Ecology.  Industrial ecology is an emerging field
              focused on the  environment which takes a systems view of industrial activity
              and  its external interactions.  It takes selected approaches of  biological
              ecology (resource cycling, energy flows, food webs,  etc.) and uses them to
              study such topics as materials and energy  cycling in industry.  The goal is to
              decrease impacts on the  natural environment and to increase the sustainability
              and  efficiency of energy and materials use.  It takes system-wide  views and
              is clearly multidisciplinary, involving (among others)  chemical engineers,
              industrial engineers, manufacturing  engineers, physicists, chemists, materials
              scientists, and  operations researchers.    Any emerging field lacks many of
              the traditional mechanisms for  the production and communication of research,
              particularly  periodic, broadly structured conferences at which the most recent
               and exciting research can be shared and discussed.  To begin to  fill this
              gap, the Principal Investigator submitted a proposal  for a Gordon Research
              Conference on Industrial Ecology.  That  proposal was accepted, and the first
              such conference will be held  in the summer of 1998.  ***
