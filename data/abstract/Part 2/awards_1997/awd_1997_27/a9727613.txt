Abstract    :
              9727613  Manning  The enzyme, D-amino acid transaminase (DAT), has intrinsic 
              interest for its enzymological and its bacteriological  properties, which are
              related. This research will focus on  its stereochemical relationship to an
              enzyme that acts only  on L-amino acids. The investigators have both structures
               (which are remarkably similar overall) on their Silicon  Graphics workstation
              and they have compiled tables of  sequence homologies and differences, which
              will be used for  site-directed mutagenesis studies in order to convert one 
              enzyme specificity to the other.  The bonding between the  subunits will be
              studied by a new procedure using very high  resolution gel filtration. Studies
              on enzyme-catalyzed side  reactions, coenzyme binding, and the stabilization of
              a  reaction intermediate by mutant enzymes will be continued.    This is a
              project to study the stereochemistry and structure  of D-amino acid
              transaminase (DAT), a vitamin B6 (pyridoxal  phosphate or PLP) containing
              enzyme. DAT supplies the  building blocks for biosynthesis of peptidoglycans, 
              constituents of bacterial cell walls. It has unusual  features, such as
              inactivation by substrate under certain  conditions.  Understanding how
              physiological compounds  mediate substrate inactivation could be predictive of
              in  vivo regulation of the enzyme. Using this enzyme to  understand how to
              alter stereospecificity in enzymic  reactions is a potential payoff.  The
              mechanistic studies  proposed should be generalizable to other enzymes in the 
              transaminase family.
