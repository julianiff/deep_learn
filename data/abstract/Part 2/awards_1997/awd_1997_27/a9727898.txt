Abstract    :
                                          ABSTRACT      This project will facilitate the
              transfer of the collection of  parasitic mites of birds (feather mites) from
              the University of  Georgia to the University of Michigan.  The collection, the
              most  extensive of its kind in the New World, is in danger of being  orphaned. 
              The project will also provide for the improvement of  collection storage
              facilities associated with the collections of  ectoparasitic and commensal
              arthropods of the Insect Division of  the University of Michigan Museum of
              Zoology (UMMZ). This existing  collection of ectoparasites is one of the
              largest and most diverse  in the country, with over 120,000 slide mounted
              specimens and  16,000 lots of parasites, primarily from mammals, birds and
              insects  from around the world. Of particular importance are the large 
              collections obtained through collaborations with vertebrate  biologists
              conducting faunal surveys in poorly known and endangered  parts of the world
              such as Madagascar and the Philippines.  The  project will additionally assist
              in the preparation of slide  mounted specimens from the large backlog of
              accumulated alcohol  lots in both the Georgia and UMMZ collections.  Because
              most  researchers either require or prefer to receive parasite specimens 
              mounted on microscope slides rather than unprepared in alcohol  lots, reduction
              of the backlog of unprepared specimens is essential  for the collection to
              serve the community. Accomplishment of these  goals will save the Georgia
              collection from potential loss and  greatly enhance the accessibility of the
              combined collection to the  scientific community.
