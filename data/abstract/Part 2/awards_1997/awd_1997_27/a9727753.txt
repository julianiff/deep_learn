Abstract    :
              The sense of smell is very important for behavior and food selection, but we
              still know very little about how olfactory information from the nose is handled
              by the brain.  One model system that has been very useful in studying the sense
              of smell has been the crayfish, because these aquatic animals use their
              antennae as 'noses' of very high sensitivity for compounds dissolved in the
              water.  Recent discoveries in many invertebrates, including crayfish, have
              shown some aspects of brain organization in olfactory areas may be similar to
              olfactory parts of the brain in mammals, so they provide useful comparative
              experimental subjects for examining functional properties of this common
              anatomical organization.  This work will utilize electrophysiological
              recordings from individual neurons, or nerve cells, within the olfactory part
              of the brain of crayfish.  These neurons form local small networks that show
              oscillatory activity when stimulated.   Here, the temporal properties of the
              input signal traffic and of the local networks will be recorded to determine
              where particular kinds of synchronous patterns of activity originate, how the
              neurons are selectively stimulated by certain patterns of input and how they
              are functionally coupled together, and what may be the importance of periodic
              bursts of activity.
    Results will be important not only to understanding
              olfactory integration, but also to understanding mechanisms for
              olfactory-driven behaviors, and to computational and cognitive neuroscience for
              analyzing how synchronous and patterned neural activity in networks may have a
              function in developing memories.
