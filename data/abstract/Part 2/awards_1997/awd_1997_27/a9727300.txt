Abstract    :
              9727300  Hamburger    This award provides partial funding (75%) for the
              acquisition and  field installation of Global Positioning System (GPS) stations
              that  will be used for measuring crustal strain associated with the 
              displacement of magma underneath volcanoes. The remaining 25% cost  of the
              project will be paid by Indiana University. Continuous  measurement of vertical
              and horizontal displacements of the crust  above volcanoes will be achieved by
              installing an array of GPS  receivers in order to better understand the
              processes associated  with volcanic eruptions and to improve eruption
              prediction  capabilities.  ***
