Abstract    :
              This  interdisciplinary award to Ya-Ping Sun at Clemson University is  
              supported by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division and   the
              Solid-State Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research.   The
              focus of the research is the design and synthesis of fullerene   materials and
              polymers with nonlinear optical properties. The   photophysical and absorptive
              properties of mono- and polyfunctionalized   C60 derivatives,  and polymers
              with pendant fullerene groups will be   investigated, directed towards
              developing intramolecular triplet energy   donor-acceptor dyads as strong
              nonlinear absorbers.  Specifically, dyads   employing (60)-fullerene,
              porphyrins, and metallophthalocyanines as the   donors and beta-carotene,
              diphenylhexadecaoctaenes and their derivatives   as acceptors will be prepared
              and evaluated.  Optical limiting will be   the primary application investigated
              for the polymeric fullerene   materials.  This research will advance the
              development of materials for optical,   electro-optical, acousto-optical and
              optomechanical devices for   applications such as optical limiting, storage,
              and switching and will   increase our understanding of the chemistry and
              photophysics of fullerene   materials and polymers.
