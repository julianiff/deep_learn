              Abstract  ATM -9727329  Tsonis, Anastasios  University of Wisconsin  TITLE:
              Improving the Information on Precipitation Over Oceans and Studying its
              Temporal  and Spatial Variability    One of the most comprehensive climate data
              sets is the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee/ COADS (UWM/COADS) analysis set.
              Precipitation over the oceans is probably the least reliable quantity in the
              data set..  This proposal suggests a way to correct for this satellite -
              derived rainfall over the oceanic regions by multivariate models that include
              other quantities that are more reliable and are directly observed. The proposal
              intends to investigate the temporal and spatial variability of the global
              precipitation field over selected oceanic regions as well as over the globe
              utilizing such corrected precipitation data.  The data produced by the proposal
              will be of great value for climate studies and research.
