                        University of Colorado    This grant is awarded through the
              Separations and Purification Program sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport
              and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The
              principal investigator is Dr. Josef Michl of the University of Colorado at
              Boulder. The research will test a new concept in the two-dimensional
              cross-linking polymerization of molecular modules into covalent molecular
              grids. This will permit the crosslinking to be both revsersible, thus
              permitting annealing to highly regular 2-D crystalline structures, and
              irreversible, making the grids very sturdy and useful for applications. These
              seemingly contradictory requirements will be met by separating the initial
              reversible organization of the grid through weakly and reversibly binding
              ("phantom") couplers in time from the final fixing of the grid through strongly
              and irreversibly binding real couplers.    The preparation of ultrathin
              molecular grids with controllable opening dimensions and selectable chemical
              functionalization would open new horizons in membrane science. Such 2-D
              molecular sieves would be capable of handling extremely high fluxes and pore
              blockage would also be minimized. Successful research could have a major impact
              on separations technology.
