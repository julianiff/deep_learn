Abstract    :
              This grant in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program supports research by Dr. James Burlitch to investigate the   synthesis
              and reactivity of silica-supported magnesium hydroperoxides.  A   primary goal
              of the research is to characterize and develop the redox   chemistry of the
              proposed -SiOMgOOH group.  Characterization will include   the use of Raman,
              infrared, and solid-state NMR spectroscopic techniques.    Spectroscopic
              properties of the magnesium hydroperoxides will be   compared with those of
              similar groups that are bound to surface-modified   silica gels and to discrete
              model compounds.  The reactivity of these   solid-state oxidants will also be
              explored.  Reactions will be carried   out with model reductants and, once
              conditions are established for simple   oxidations, studies will be extended to
              base-sensitive groups such as   chlorinated hydrocarbons.  This program will
              not only provide fundamental information in the area of   oxidation chemistry,
              but may also lead to the development of a   convenient, mild, and selective
              reagent for carrying out chemical   transformations.  Additionally, magnesium
              hydroperoxides have the   potential to replace more dangerous and less
              environmentally friendly   industrial oxidants.
