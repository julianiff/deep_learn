Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      9727102    This research focuses on ethnically and linguistically
              mixed communities of northeastern Siberia to analyze past and present processes
              of social and cultural exchange.  The three communities chosen for study share
              several features linked to Russian colonization of Siberia.  Study methods
              include archival research, semi-structured interviews, collection of oral
              histories, and participant observation.  The fieldwork compares concepts of
              ethnic identity, social status, and political power across the three
              communities.  Results will be analyzed in a comparative perspective to shed
              light on ethnic identity and the recognition of indigenous status in the
              circumpolar north.
