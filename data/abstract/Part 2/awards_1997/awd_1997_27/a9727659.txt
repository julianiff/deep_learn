Abstract    :
              9727659    Starmer    The species of yeast that live in decaying stem or fruit
              tissues of cactus are distinctly different. Even though the two communities are
              found side-by-side, they rarely share common species. This grant will use this
              biological situation as an experimental system to examine the reasons for
              membership in biological communities and their overall diversity. Factors that
              will be studied include: 1) dispersal, the role of drosophilid vectors that
              distribute the yeasts from habitat to habitat; 2) species interactions, the
              role of killer toxins produced by some of the yeasts; and  3) their
              interactions, the role of trade-offs between colonization and competitive
              ability. Interactions between dispersal and interactions will be investigated
              in depth to test the hypothesis that increasing the colonization ability of
              highly competitive organisms has a greater influence on community membership
              than increasing the colonization ability of poorer competitors.  The work will
              be done by using experimental microcosms in a laboratory. These investigations
              should contribute to an understanding of the factors influencing microbial
              diversity and provide knowledge on what maintains distinct community types in
              the natural world. The study relates directly to concerns in applied biology
              about the maintenance of biological diversity in general and about the
              practical use of microorganisms for biological control.
