Abstract    :
              9727654  Smithson    The single most important result from deep scientific
              drilling in  crystalline rocks in Russia and Germany may be the discovery of 
              hydrous fluids through the entire depth range (9 to 12 km) of deep  boreholes. 
              The presence of hydrous fluids is so important, because  even in small amounts,
              they have a dramatic effect on geologic  processes such as mineral reactions,
              melting, rock strength,  material transfer, seismic wave attenuation and ore
              deposits.   Fluids also strongly affect seismic reflectivity by creating larger
               reflection coefficients than can be found from rock-rock interfaces  alone.   
              This award supports the U.S. portion of a cooperative project with  the
              Principal Investigator's German colleagues to conduct a  vertical seismic
              profile (VSP) in the deep part (3-8.5 km) of the  KTB borehole in Germany and a
              moving source profile (MSP) from the  surface into geophones in the borehole. 
              The ICDP (International  Continental Scientific Drilling Program) has already
              approved  funding for the project.  This award will provide one-third of the 
              data acquisition costs.  The Principal Investigator will  participate in the
              data acquisition and data analysis by  contributing his time to the project at
              no charge.  ***
