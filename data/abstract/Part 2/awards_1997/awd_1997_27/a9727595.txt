Abstract    :
                 This  project  partially funds the 1998  Gordon  Research  Conference on
              Composite Materials to be held January 4 to 9,  1998 at the Double Tree Hotel
              in Ventura, California.  Funds  granted  will  be used to pay registration fees
               and  travel  expenses  for  invited  speakers,  discussion  leaders,  and 
              possibly  poster authors, primarily those representative  of  underrepresented
              groups in the engineering community.    The  Gordon Research Conference on
              Composite Materials  is  one  of  the  few Gordon Research Conferences on  a 
              subject  relevant  to  material science and perhaps the  only  Gordon  Research
              Conference that effectively combines talks on  both  mechanics and materials.
              The atmosphere of a Gordon Research  Conference,   which   includes  ample 
              time   for   informal  discussions,  is  renown for fostering interactions 
              between  scientists  working  on  an interdisciplinary  subject  like 
              composite materials.  One of the best conference experiences  a  scientist  can
               have  is  to  attend  a  Gordon  Research  Conference in his or her area of
              specialization.  The Gordon  Research Conference on Composite Materials stands
              out as the  only  opportunity that a composite scientist or a  mechanics  and
              materials scientist has to attend a Gordon conference.    A   broad   range  
              of  speakers,  poster   authors,   and  participants  have  been  sought out 
              for  the  1998  Gordon  Research  Conference  on Composite Materials.   The 
              invited  speakers  will  cover a range on interdisciplinary  subjects 
              including  matrix chemistry, interfacial issues,  processing  problems,   and 
              mechanics  and  durability   of   composite  structures.   An  emphasis of the
              1998  conference  will  be  placed on talks that combine mechanics and
              materials issues.  Typical  talks  in these areas will be on the micromechanics
               of   damage,  on  the  mystery  of  mode  II  fracture,   on  interfacial  
              properties,  and  on  aging   and   durability  issues.
