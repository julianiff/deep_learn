Abstract    :
                    9727548  Simms  In this collaborative research project the investigators
              address a central question in ecology, to what extent do consumers control
              plant population dynamics?  Their field study is directed at determining the
              conditions under which insect and mice consumers alter population dynamics of a
              shrub.  The project will include three separate manipulative field experiments
              in grasslands and sand dunes. First, the density of insect herbivores and
              rodent granivores will be manipulated in separate plots planted with the target
              plant.  The second experiment will include plots with different numbers of
              lupine seeds to determine how seed bank size affects recruitment of the target
              plant. The third experiment will manipulate plant density and below ground
              insect herbivory to determine whether competition affects plant tolerance or
              resistance to herbivory.
