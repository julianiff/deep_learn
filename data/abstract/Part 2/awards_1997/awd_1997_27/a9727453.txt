Abstract    :
              9727453  Cashman   This is a feasibility study to determine if particle size
              distribution in cataclastic rocks case be determined by automated scanning
              techniques.  If successful, large numbers of crushed grains in fault rocks can
              be measured, and criteria developed to help isolate mechanisms of faulting and
              several important fault parameters.
