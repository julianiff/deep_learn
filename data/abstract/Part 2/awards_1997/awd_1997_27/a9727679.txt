Abstract    :
               This is a study of the Heaven's Gate religious group.  The research is
              supported under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) rubric, having
              severe urgency with regard to availability of data.  Heaven's Gate illustrates
              an extreme level of member commitment, and one research theme will be the
              social processes that built up this high degree of social control and
              organization over time.  Related themes are conversion, defection, and
              charismatic leadership.  The primary data collection method will be in-depth
              interviews with members who left the group in the last ten years.  Other
              sources of data will include archives, recordings of group activities, and
              interviews with relatives of members.     This research will help develop an
              emerging research area: the sociology of high-tension religious movements that
              exist outside the standard cultural traditions.  At the same time, it will
              provide a fundamental basis of knowledge concerning deviant religious groups
              that will help government officials and policy makers deal with the many
              challenges that these group increasingly present in modern society.
