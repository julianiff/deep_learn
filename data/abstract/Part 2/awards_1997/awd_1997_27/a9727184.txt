Abstract    :
              The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum forages independently for bacteria in
              the soil.  When the food is exhausted, the cells have several options - they
              can make resistant structures in the form of microcycts, macrocysts, or
              fruiting bodies.  Macrocysts are reproductive structures, but have not yielded
              a system of genetic analysis.  The PI suggests that standard strains are
              incompatible due to a form of parasitism, in which one mating type exploits the
              other.  Using insertional mutagenesis and dominant drug resistance genes, he is
              attempting to silence the incompatibility mechanism and develop a system of
              reproductive genetic analysis.  Insertional mutagenesis allows us to examine
              the nature of the genes that cause incompatibility.    Fruiting bodies have an
              exceptionally complex development, leading to a stalk supporting a ball of
              viable spores.  Because the stalk cells constitute 20% of the population and
              they die, there is competition to form a spore, rather than a stalk.  The PI
              has used this evolutionary principle to design selection procedures which have
              produced mutants that form spores rather than stalk when they develop in
              chimeras with wild type cells.  The mutated genes are being recovered and
              characterized.  The affected genes should be central to the communication
              between developing cells.  Dictyostelium discoideum and other social amoebae
              have an unusual evolutionary biology which can be applied to understanding
              their development.
