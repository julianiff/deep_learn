              BLAKE, DONALD  SHEPSON, PAUL  UNIVERSITY CA-IRVINE PURDUE UNIVERSITY    The
              project will determine the atmospheric concentration of nitrogen compounds in
              the atmosphere by conducting a field experiment at a field camp at the summit
              of the Greenland ice sheet.  The concentration of nitrogen compounds in the
              atmosphere will be compared to their concentration in freshly deposited snow so
              that the record of atmospheric chemistry that is retained in the permanent ice
              record at the site may be interpreted for changes in the chemistry of the
              troposphere that have occurred since human activities began to affect the
              atmosphere.  That record will lead to important conclusions about the human
              impacts of global change on the atmosphere and will allow an examination of the
              natural cycles of atmospheric chemistry over the past 100,000 years.
