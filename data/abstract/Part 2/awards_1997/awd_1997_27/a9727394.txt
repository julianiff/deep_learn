Abstract    :
                This research project at the University of Houston is supported by  the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  Professor Kevan and  his coworkers
              use electron magnetic resonance and electron spin  echo modulation spectrometry
              to elucidate the structural  environment of transition metal ions in
              microporous and mesoporous  oxide materials.  These aluminophosphate (AlPO) and
               silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) compounds are important catalytic  materials,
              and the work of this project is directed toward  understanding their structure
              as it relates to catalytic function.   Nickel and manganese ions in particular
              will be examined, and newly  synthesized hexagonal phase AlPO and SAPO oxides
              will be emphasized  in these studies.  The materials investigated in this work
              have  important applications in petroleum refining, and hydrocarbon  process
              chemistry.  The use of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy for the 
              structural elucidation of transition metal ions in oxide materials  is the
              focus of this research project.  Nickel and manganese ions  incorporated into
              alumino- and silicoaluminophosphate supports are  being examined.  Connections
              between structure and function of  these catalytic materials are the expected
              results of this work,  which has important implications for the development of
              petroleum  refining catalysts.
