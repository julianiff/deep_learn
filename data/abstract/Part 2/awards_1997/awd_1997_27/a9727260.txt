Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9727260  RINGO    This Research Opportunity Award (ROA) funds a
              two year project for a researcher from Gonzaga University (RUI/PUI) to work
              with the University of Washington research site of the Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for Design of Analog/Digital Integrated Circuits
              located at Washington State University.  The project is entitled, "Modeling
              Thermal and Electro-thermal Behavior Integrated Circuit Devices."    The study
              will address numerically solving the heat transfer problem for a "generic"
              integrated circuit investigating the effects of the geometry, material
              properties, and boundary/initial conditions on the temperature response.
