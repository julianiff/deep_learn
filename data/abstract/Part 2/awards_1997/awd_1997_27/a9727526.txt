Abstract    :
              This research examines the asymmetric functionalization of alkenes and ketones
              by square-planar palladium(II) catalysts containing mono- and bi-dentate chiral
              ligands.    Yield and enantioselectivity of the catalyzed oxidation of
              monosubstituted olefins, oxidation of acyclic and cyclic ketones and the
              halogenation of olefins will be determined as functions of catalyst composition
              and reaction parameters, principally hydrogen ion concentration.   New
              synthetic methodologies based on the palladium(II) catalyzed asymmetric
              functionalization of different alkenes will be developed and optimized.

With
              this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the
              research and educational activities of Dr. Patrick Henry of the Chemistry
              Department of Loyola University of Chicago.    Professor Henry's research will
              focus on elucidating the mechanism by which palladium(II) complexes catalyze
              the asymmetric oxidation and halogenation of different alkenes.   New synthetic
              methodologies, in some cases, capable of one-step syntheses of asymmetrically
              functionalized alkenes will be tested and optimized.   Professor Henry's
              educational activities involve the training of postdoctoral students.
