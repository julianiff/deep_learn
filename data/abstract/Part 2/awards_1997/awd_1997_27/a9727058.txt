              Abstract        97-27058 Schladow    Collaborative Research: Deep chlorophyll
              layers as export production zones in lake ecosystems: The importance of
              hydrodynamics and biological transport in the formation and maintenance of
              metalimnetic production    In clear lakes and seas, much of the microscopic
              plant biomass occurs deep in the water column, in strata called
              deep-chlorophyll layers. Little is known about the processes that form these
              layers, nor their importance for fueling production of zooplankton and fish.
              Working in lakes of the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho, the investigators will use
              the stable isotope lsN and water mass tracers to determine: (1) the sources of
              nutrients that support plant production in the deep chlorophyll layers; (2) the
              relative importance of physical mixing processes (e.g. wind, turbulence) and
              biological processes for moving nutrients between strata, and; (3) how much of
              the plant production in the deep water is transferred to the invertebrates and
              fish in different strata. This research will thus further our understanding of
              linkages between physical, chemical, and biological processes that govern
              production in aquatic food webs.
