              ABSTRACT    Proposal # : 9727800 (Wieder And Yavitt)    Title: CARBON CYCLING
              AND PEAT ACCUMULATION IN THE DISCONTINUOUS PERMAFROST REGION OF BOREAL,
              CONTINENTAL, WESTERN CANADA    Institution: VILLANOVA UNIVERSITY    Boreal and
              subarctic peatlands contain about a third of the world's soil carbon pool and
              presently function as a net sink for atmospheric CO2 and a major source of
              atmospheric CH4.  This research focuses on the extensive peat deposits in the
              discontinuous permafrost regions of boreal, continental, western Canada, where
              new findings suggest that permafrost has been melting in recent years, possibly
              in response to warming climatic conditions.  Both field and laboratory studies
              will be conducted to test hypotheses related to carbon balance and peat
              accumulation/degradation.  The research is structured around four questions: 1)
              How does the presence, absence, or disappearance of permafrost affect peat
              accumulation rate and peat organic matter quality in peatlands of the
              discontinuous permafrost region? 2) How does the presence, absence, or
              disappearance of permafrost affect CO2 and CH4 production/emission and controls
              on production/emission in peatlands of the discontinuous permafrost region?  3)
              Will the carbon balance of peat underlain by permafrost be tipped from peat as
              a sink for atmospheric carbon to a net source of carbon to the atmosphere as
              permafrost melts? and 4) Do roots contribute substantially to CO2 and CH4
              production/emission in peatlands in the discontinuous permafrost zone?  By
              understanding the factors that affect CO2 and CH4 production and emission, the
              work will lead to insights into the potential carbon cycling responses of these
              extensive peatlands to projected regional and global climate changes in
              general, and to ongoing permafrost degradation and melting more specifically.
