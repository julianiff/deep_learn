Abstract    :
               9727843  Apsell    WGBH Educational Foundation will explore new ways to
              accurately depict in a large format film the eruption of a volcano that
              occurred in 79 AD.   One means is to use footage of Montserrat, a similar
              volcano that currently is erupting.  In order to do this, however, they must
              film the volcano in the immediate future while it is still erupting and the
              block and ash flow is still clearly visible.  Once this is completed, WGBH will
              conduct various testing to address such questions as the following:    * Can
              original footage shot in large format film be used to dramatize events of the
              past?  * Can original footage of the ash eruptions on Montserrat be used in a
              composite with live action footage of Vesuvius today?  * Can original footage
              of the plumes be used in a composite with a miniature model of Vesuvius?  * Can
              the original footage be enhanced with computer graphics, or will it need to be
              "degraded" to create an historical sense?
