Abstract    :
              INT 97-27193   Klabunde      This U.S.-Bulgarian cooperative research project is
              on "Nanoscale Metal/Boride Particles Containing Rare Earth Elements."  The
              principal investigators are Dr. Kenneth Klabunde of Kansas State University and
              Dr. Iovka Dragieva of the Bulgarian Central Laboratory for Electrochemical
              Power Sources.  The researchers will carry out projects on the synthesis and
              characterization of mixed metal-boride nanoparticles of interest in magnetism
              and other technologies.   The Bulgarian group will continue and improve their
              borohydride reduction schemes for producing such composites and will learn
              another approach - metal vapor synthesis.  The U.S. group will continue and
              improve their metal vapor approaches and will also improve their earlier
              nonaqeous borohydride reduction techniques.   The complementary expertise of
              the two groups could lead to nanoparticulate forms of interesting materials
              that in bulk are among the strongest permanent magnet materials known.       
              This project in chemistry research fulfills the program objectives of bringing
              together leading experts in the U.S. and Bulgaria to combine complementary
              efforts and capabilites in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on
              the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
