Abstract    :
                  9727327  Chiu  The purpose of the project is to hold a joint workshop of the
               Task Committee of the United States-Japan Cooperative Program on  Natural
              Resources (UJNR).  The theme of the workshop is  "Prediction and Control of
              Wind-Induced Response" and will be  held at the East-West Center on the campus
              of the University of  Hawaii.  The topics to be discussed are: (a) Topographic
              effects  on wind and the use of geographic information systems (GIS) to  study
              these effects; (b) Control of wind-induced response of  structures; (c)
              Computational fluid dynamics versus wind tunnel  tests; (d) Prediction of
              wind-induced responses of full-scale  structures; and (e) Investigation of wind
              hazards, including  damage assessment technologies.  For the technical program 
              plenary sessions and small working group sessions are scheduled.   A technical
              study tour will include the Tsunami Warning Venter,  the Pacific Hurricane
              Center, National Weather Service Forecast  Office, the NOAA Mauna Loa
              Observatory and the Hawaii Volcano  Observatory.  The research agenda developed
              will benefit the wind  engineering research committees from both countries.
