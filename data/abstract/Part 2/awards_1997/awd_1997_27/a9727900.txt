Abstract    :
              This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to Brandeis University  
              supports the research of Professor Wenbin Lin.  The theme of the research   is
              nanocrystal-functionalized materials for optical applications.   
              Nanocrystallites are intrinsically unstable due to high surface tension   and
              need to be incorporated into other matrices to enhance stability.    This
              research examines two new approaches to stabilizing nanocrystals by   forming
              nanocrystal-functionalized polymers and self-assembled   multilayers.  A
              surface modification approach is used to prepare   nanocrystals terminated with
              trialkoxysilanes or negatively charged   alkylsulfonate groups.  These
              nanocrystal-functionalized precursors are   used to form self-assembled
              multilayers of nanocrystals via siloxane   linkages or by alternate adsorption
              of polymeric cations and   alkylsulfonate-derivatized nanocrystals.   The
              research will lead to better understanding of the fundamental   properties of
              nanocrystals and to production of interesting   nanocrystal-functionalized
              materials.  Such materials hold the promise   for applications as nonlinear
              optical materials, photo-catalysts, and   light-emitting diodes.
