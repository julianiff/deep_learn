Arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) are a family of
              hydroxyproline-rich
glycoproteins which are widely distributed in plants. 
              AGPs are found in
intercellular spaces, cell walls, and plasma membranes and
              implicated to
play important roles in growth and development.  This proposal
              focuses on a
putative plasma membrane AGP, LeAGP-1, deduced from tomato DNA
              clones which
demonstrate developmental and organ-specific regulation.  The
              clones
predict a novel, modular AGP comprised of an N-terminal signal peptide,
              a
central classical AGP domain sandwiching a basic subdomain, and
              C-terminal
putative transmembrane domain.  Our working hypotheses are that
              LeAGP-1
represents a plasma membrane AGP and that it functions in
              establishing
connections and mediating adhesion to the cell wall, analogous to
              animal
cell adhesion molecules.  The PIs will test these hypotheses and
              address
structure and function of LeAGP-1 by: 1) isolating and
              biochemically
characterizing LeAGP-1 from tomato cell cultures to provide
              structural
information and material for functional characterization,
              2)
immunolocalizing LeAGP-1 in cultured cells, stems, and flowers and
              in
plasmolyzed cells demonstrating zones of adhesion between the membrane
              and
wall, and 3) functionally characterizing LeAGP-1 at the molecular
              level
(tests for intermolecular crosslinking) and whole plant level
              (LeAGP-1
antisense suppression/sense cosuppression in transgenic plants).
