Abstract    :
              Henry Taube of the Chemistry Department, Stanford University, is   supported by
              the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry   Program to carry out
              mechanistic studies of oxidation-reduction reactions   of osmium compounds. 
              One highlight of the study will be comparison of   the reactivity of osmium
              (III) monohydrides with analogous compounds with   I, II, and IV oxidation
              states.   A variety of other topics will be   investigated: 1)
              oxidation-reduction and acid-base chemistry of   dihydrogen complexes of
              osmium; 2) examination of the influence of a   facial geometry, imposed by
              triazacyclononane ligands, upon the high   oxidation-state chemistry of osmium;
              and 3) and investigations into the   reactivity of novel seven-coordinate
              paramagnetic Os (IV) complexes.  The research is of a fundamental nature and,
              as such, provides the   foundation for understanding how to control electron
              transfer.  The   information garnered from these studies may provide crucial
              insights into   the development of new catalysts or molecular electronics.
