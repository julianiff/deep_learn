Abstract    :
              9727516  Poeppelmeier      The preparation of new materials is one of the most
              challenging  problems in modern solid-state chemistry.  The research objective 
              over the period of the next three years is to synthesize a large  number of
              mixed metal oxyfluorides prepared from (hydrogen  fluoride) x
              pyridine/pyridine/water solution (150 degrees  centigrade, autoclave autogenous
              pressure) using metal oxides as  reagents.  The "composition space" approach
              will establish  individual regions of stability (crystallization fields) and 
              enable the selective crystallization of different phases within  each system
              studied.  Structures are expected which range from  polynuclear clusters to one
              dimensional chains, two-dimensional  layers and three dimensional frameworks. 
              The hydrolytic  chemistry of multi-cation precursors, templating methodology,
              and  pH controlled oxolation (polyanions) and olation (polycations)  reaction
              chemistry under study will advance our understanding of  inorganic chemistry. 
              %%%  The design of inorganic solids is the important step in the  development
              of materials that enhance our living standards.  Research is proposed to
              develop new methodologies for inorganic  chemistry leading to more complex
              inorganic solids compared to  those that are presently available for use in
              computers,  automobiles and as catalysts in the chemical and petroleum 
              industry.  ***
