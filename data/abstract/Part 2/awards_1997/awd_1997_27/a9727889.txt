Abstract    :
              Project Kaleidoscope (PKAL) proposes to host an event for the Washington DC
              community focusing on "Shaping the Future...."  This Report, which presents an
              agenda for action to strengthen the undergraduate SME&T community, makes
              significant recommendations for academic institutions to address in their work
              of reform.  Recognizing that 'shaping the future' of undergraduate SME&T
              requires the commitment and informed support of a wide range of educational,
              scientific, and national associations, the Report also makes significant
              recommendations for consideration by the wider community.  At this event, PKAL
              intends to assemble representatives of major associations (based in DC and from
              around the country) that have the opportunity and responsibility to address and
              implement the recommendations in the Report.  Our plan is to i) ask
              participants to provide detailed information about current and proposed
              activities in respond to 'shaping' recommendations' ii) organize plenary and
              small group discussions during the event during which participating
              associations determine next steps (individually and collectively) in response
              to the Report recommendations; and iii) prepare proceedings that detail the
              next steps and that can be shared during 1998 by those participating in the
              event with the members of the associations they represent.  The goal is to link
              the actions of national associations to the work of individual campuses, so
              that the work of transforming undergraduate SME&T can proceed most
              productively.
