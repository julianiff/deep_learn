Abstract    :
              9727111  Burges    This grant provides partial support for the costs of
              developing  an electronic device for monitoring the temporal progression of 
              scour depth in gravel stream beds.  Ten devices utilizing a  magnetic switch
              system to record the passage of a sequence of  indicator practice golf balls
              will eventually be built and field  tested.  Scour data will be recorded on a
              memory chip and  downloaded in the field for future analysis. The instruments
              will  be designed to have a useful life of a least six months.  No comparable
              device currently exists with which to record the  temporal progression of scour
              in gravel stream beds during storm  events and this design is both clever and
              simple enough to have a  high probability of being functional. A successful
              scour depth  monitor will have practical application to problems in civil 
              engineering, sedimentology and fisheries science.  Scour data are  particularly
              important for the engineering design of bridges and  to prediction of salmonid
              larval recruitment in gravel stream  beds of the western U.S.  ***
