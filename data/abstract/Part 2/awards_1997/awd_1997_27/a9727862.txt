Abstract    :
              This award supports a collaborative interaction between  researchers in the
              Center for Ultrafast Optical Science  (CUOS) at the University of Michigan and
              Hampton University  in their studies of acceleration of electrons through 
              wavefields generated in high-field laser-plasma  interactions.  Recent
              discoveries in this area have led to  observations of electrons of MeV
              energies, and the focus of  the combined efforts of the CUOS and Hampton groups
              will be  to characterize the electron beam emitted through the  interaction and
              use these studies to determine those  conditions of the interaction that would
              enhance the  intensity and quality of the beam.  Beyond the scientific 
              component of the work, the postdoctoral associate would  serve as the
              connecting link between the two institutions,  thereby cementing the
              interaction between this Science and  Technology Center and Hampton University,
              and HBCU  institution, and enhancing the involvement of minority  students in
              the research effort.  Funding for this position  is provided by the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities  (OMA) of the MPS Directorate.
