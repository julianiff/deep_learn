Abstract    :
              9727000   Davis     A PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF THE MONOCOTS BASED ON MOLECULAR
              AND MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTER SETS    The monocotyledons are one of the major
              groups of flowering plants (angiosperms).  This is a diverse group of about
              60,000 species that includes the grasses (wheat, maise, rice, and their many
              wild relatives), palms,  and orchids.  Although the monocot group is widely
              recognized as a natural (monophyletic) lineage within the flowering plants,
              many aspects of the history of divergence of the principal lineages within this
              group remain obscure.  Support for several major lineagess is well established
              (e.g., the order Poales, which includes grasses and their relatives, and the
              order Zingiberales, which includes the gingers, the bananas, and their
              relatives), but there are major differences in the other higher-level groupings
              recognized by various comprehensive accounts of the monocots.  Phylogenetic
              analyses based on variation in morphology and a variety of molecular
              characteristics, have yielded conflicting results which Dr. Davis' study will
              investigate using "total evidence" in which multiple character sets will be
              collected for exemplar species; these will be combined within a single data set
              and analyzed as a unit.  Data sets to be analyzed include 1) morphology with
              features of anatomy, pollen structure, and seed development included,  2) DNA
              sequence variation from genes of the chloroplasts (rbcL) and mitochondria
              (atpA), and 3) additional character sets being generated by other cooperating
              investigators.
