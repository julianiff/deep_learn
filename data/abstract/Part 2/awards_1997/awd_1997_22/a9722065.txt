Abstract    :
                   A setting for quantum mechanics will be sought that  avoids the notorious
              problems that beset the foundations of  the subject.  Such a formulation would
              rely on no prior  concept of measurement or observer, would describe 
              individual systems and not just ensembles, would make sense  for small systems
              uncoupled to an environment, and would  satisfy an appropriate locality
              condition.  Two elementary  but insufficiently noticed recent theorems raise
              the  possibility that it may be possible to satisfy all these  requirements in
              an interpretation of quantum mechanics based  on the view that the physics of
              an isolated system is  nothing more or less than the study of all the
              correlations  that exist among its subsystems.  The goal is to arrive at  an
              elementary, unmysterious, unambiguous, paradox-free, and  pedagogically useful
              interpretive framework for the quantum  theory, as a natural language for
              describing an inherently  probabilistic world.  In an independent study the
              origins of  certain misconceptions about special relativity held by  physicists
              and/or sociologists will be traced to some lapses  in the traditional
              pedagogical approaches to the subject.  Alternative routes to the special
              theory will be developed  that avoid these pitfalls.
