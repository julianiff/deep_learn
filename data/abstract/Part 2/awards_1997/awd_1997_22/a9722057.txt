Abstract    :
                   Large fluctuations, although infrequent, play a  fundamental role in a
              broad range of processes, from  nucleation to failure of electronic devices. 
              The proposed  research aims to reach understanding of the dynamics of  systems
              which perform large fluctuations, to investigate new  large-fluctuation
              phenomena, and to find optimal ways of  controlling fluctuations by external
              fields.  For classical  systems, the problem of the optimal (most probable) 
              fluctuational paths will be formulated in terms of  physically observable
              characteristics of the system and the  driving noise.  Generic singular
              features of the pattern of  optimal paths will be revealed and analyzed as well
              as the  related critical behavior of the distribution of  fluctuational paths. 
              Optimal paths in real time will be  used to investigate quantum rates of escape
              from metastable  periodic states and their singular behavior - the problem 
              which is of topical interest for experiments and to which  the standard notion
              of tunneling at a nearly constant energy  does not apply.
