Abstract    :
              9722615  Hoffman  The objective of this project is to provide a forum for the
              presentation of current research on biological methylation involving the methyl
              donor, S-adenosylmethionine.  Topic cuts across the disciplines of cell
              biology, molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, environmental biology, and
              biomedical science.  The organisms studied range from microbes to plants and
              animals, including humans.  Topics fall under the general headings of
              methylation of DNA, RNA, proteins, and small molecules, as well as S-adenosyl
              amino acid metabolism.  Approximately 60% of the program will be devoted to DNA
              methylation with the additional topics comprising the remaining 40%.  This is
              the third conference on Biological Methylation as a biennial series within the
              framework of the FASEB Summer Research Conferences, and it will be held June
              14-19, 1997, at the Vermont Academy in Saxtons River, VT.  Three types of
              presentations are scheduled: oral presentations, poster discussion, and
              posters.  Oral presentations will be given in morning and evening sessions with
              the afternoons free for viewing posters, attending poster discussions, holding
              informal discussions, and partaking of social and recreational activities.  The
              primary criterion for participants is publication of research on biological
              methylation.  The conference is international in character.  %%%  This award
              will support attendance of young investigators at the FASEB conference on
              Biological Methylation in the summer of 1997.  This meeting will bring together
              investigators interested in all aspects of methylation to discuss their work. 
              Both nucleic acid and protein methylation, as well related aspects of
              metabolism will be discussed.  ***
