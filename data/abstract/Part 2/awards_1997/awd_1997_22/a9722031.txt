Abstract    :
              9722031  Giordano  The process through which a piano generates musical tones 
              will be investigated using a combination of experimental  measurements and
              theoretical analysis.  One goal will be to  develop a theoretical model which
              describes the vibrations  of the piano soundboard throughout the musically
              important  frequency range (~ 50 - 104 Hz).  Previous work on vibrating 
              strings will be extended and then combined with our  soundboard model to
              produce a theoretical picture of the  string-soundboard combination.  Due to
              the complexity of the  geometry and the nonlinearities involved, these models
              will  be largely numerical.  They will be tested and refined by  comparison
              with detailed experimental studies of real piano  soundboards and strings, and
              these measurements will also be  carried out as part of this project.  In the
              final stage of  this work they will extend the modeling to calculate the  sound
              produced by their numerical piano.  ***
