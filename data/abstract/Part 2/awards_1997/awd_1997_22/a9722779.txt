Abstract    :
              9722779  Olafsson  This is an international collaboration that involves the PI,
              three co-PIs (Thomas Branson and Palle Jorgensen, U. of Iowa; and Peter Gilkey,
              U. of Oregon) and researchers in Germany, France, Norway, and Denmark.  The
              research will attempt to solve a number of problems in modern analysis dealing,
              in particular with geometric and analytic aspects of spectral theory on Lie
              groups, homogeneous spaces, and more general manifolds.  This award is expected
              to promote a strongly interactive research program focusing on the stated
              areas, that will also allow graduate students to participate in the
              international collaboration.  Although the research plan envisions five
              separate research groups (two in Germany, and one in each of the other
              countries), all of the topics are related, and there will be extensive
              interplay among the groups.  The problems to be studied are motivated by
              current questions in mathematical physics, and their solution will be a
              substantial addition to that field.
