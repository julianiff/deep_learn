Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at Florida State University will purchase
              computing equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research in the
              mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for several research
              projects, including:      Computing in Geometry (M.  Seppeli et al.)  Numerical
              Uniformization of Grothendieck Dessins and Bel@l maps (P.  Bowers)  Symbolic
              Computation for Hopf Algebras (W.  Nichols)    The Symbolic Computations Group
              at Florida State University has been formed to focus on new, nontraditional
              computational mathematical projects such as these.  The extremely high-speed
              computers to be purchased, with their extensive storage capacity and advanced
              graphical capabilities, will enable the application of a synergistic mix of
              geometric, algebraic, and numeric techniques to effect rapid advances in these 
              new mathematical directions.  Possible areas of application include brain
              mapping and the design of efficient hard-disk read-heads.
