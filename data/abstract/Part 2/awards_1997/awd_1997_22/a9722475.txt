Abstract    :
              9722495  Reading    This Americas Program award will give partial support to 
              eight US researchers, one post-doctoral scientist, and one  undergraduate
              student to participate in a  joint Latin  America seminar on atomic collisions,
              to be held in Rosario,  Argentina, on March, 1997.   Organizers are Dr. John 
              Reading, Texas A & M University, in collaboration with Dr.  Roberto Rivarola,
              Universidad Nacional de Rosario,  Argentina.  The seminar will focus on  recent
              developments  and future directions of research in the field.  The central 
              objective of the program will be to identify problems of  mutual interest to US
               and Latin American physicists, in  order to delineate new ways in which recent
              advances, such  as use of storage rings and traps, relativistic collisions, 
              biological applications, and others, can be used to advance  new science. 
              Emphasis will be on areas in which cooperative  programs are being initiated or
              planned.    The U.S. and Argentinean participants have made important 
              contributions to the physics of atomico and molecular  collisions. The topics
              for discussion at this workshop are  likely to have an impact not only on
              various areas of  physics, but also in biology and chemistry, and may lead to 
              significant applications in weather forecasting, forensic  medicine, and other
              areas.    ***
