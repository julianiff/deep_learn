Abstract    :
              9722719  Ludwig                This award supports the development of software
              for analysis  and graphical presentation of data relating to research in 
              geochronology relying on radioactive isotope systems. The Isoplot  program,
              currently in use by a majority of geochronology  laboratories worldwide, will
              be upgraded for adaptability to modern  hardware/software platforms. The
              upgraded version of the Isoplot  program will be made available at no charge to
              any interested user.  ***
