Abstract    :
              9722872  Veeck    This award supports a 9 month National Science Foundation 
              Dissertation Enhancement award for Dr. Gregory Veeck at the  Hirosaki
              University Department of Agricultural Economics,  Hirosaki City, Japan.  Dr.
              Veeck's student, Ms. Ann  Brucklacher, will work with Dr. Kensaku Kanda,
              Professor of  Agricultural Economics, on a research project entitled,  "Rural
              and Agricultural Restructuring in Aomori Prefecture,  Japan:  A Study of the
              Lives and Economies of Apple  Growers."    The proposed research will document
              changes in the economies  and lives of apple growers in the Tsugaru Region of
              Aomori  Prefecture, Japan.  Using archival studies, interviews, and  surveys,
              the  research will examine rural and agricultural  restructuring over the last
              century and will focus on  changes in agriculture and rural life in the past
              twenty  years in the Chunan District, the core district of apple  growing in
              the Tsugaru Region.  Historical research on the  region as a whole will permit
              a spatial reconstruction of  the apple industry from the 1870s to the present
              and will  relate changes in the industry to locational factors and to 
              corresponding economic, political, and social trends.  Data  gained from the
              study will be used as a framework for a  broader understanding of contemporary
              agricultural and  cultural restructuring occurring throughout rural Japan.  ***
