Abstract    :
                This three-year award supports US-UK cooperative research among three
              investigators:    Derek Sears at the University of Arkansas and Grenville
              Turner and Ian Lyon at the   University of Manchester.  The objective is to
              systematically measure the oxygen isotope   composition of olivine (the major
              silicate mineral) in chondrules, the major structural   component of chondrite
              meteorites.  Chondrules and their formation are considered an   important and
              widespread phenomenon in the early solar systems.  The analysis of their  
              composition and properties could be used to determine the origin and history of
              chondrite   meteorites, the most common form of meteorites, and eventually
              contribute to our   understanding of the origins of solar systems.  The US
              investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in petrography and chemical
                characterization of chondrules.  This is complemented by the British
              investigators'   expertise in oxygen isotope measurements and their development
              of an ion microprobe   method for determining the oxygen isotope ratios in
              chondrules.
