Abstract    :
              IBN:  9722220  PI:  Eddins  Human hearing can detect even simple sounds better
              when they last longer, and this auditory temporal integration may be
              particularly important in processing more complex acoustic signals such as
              speech.  Although psychophysical studies of acoustic perception show this
              integration, we know very little about the underlying physiological mechanisms
              in auditory brain centers.  This project uses physiological recordings of
              evoked brain activity and of responses of single nerve cells to measure the
              changing thresholds for signal detection with stimulus duration, to model the
              contributions of different parts of the auditory pathway, and to clarify the
              parallels between single neuron activity and gross evoked-potential responses. 
              Integral to these research aims is the educational goal of this Career project
              to teach undergraduate and graduate students basic neurophysiological research
              methods, by developing an investigative laboratory course along with an
              interactive multimedia textbook to accompany the course.  Results will be
              important in neuroscience to clarify the important issue of the physiological
              nature of auditory temporal processing in the brain, and to understand
              processing of more complex sounds such as speech, and also will be have an
              important educational impact on many students in the speech and hearing
              sciences who might otherwise receive very little neuroscience background.
