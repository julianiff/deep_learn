Abstract    :
              INT 9722488  Musfeldt      This U.S.-Hungary research project between Janice
              Musfeldt of the State University of New York at Binghamton and Katalin Kamaras
              of the Hungarian Institute for Solid State Physics, Budapest, will contribute
              to our basic knowledge of structural phase transitions in low-dimensional
              organic solids.  Specifically, their efforts will feature characterization of
              the C60 photopolymer in a variety of structural phases, including:
              order-disorder and glassy behavior in pure single crystals, doping induced
              structural modifications, and nano-phases such as tubules and wires.  The U.S.
              contribution will feature low-temperature infrared and pulsed EPR (electron
              paramagnetic resonance) measurements while the Hungarian contributions will
              include polymer film growth, structural analysis and thermal characterization. 
              Results should contribute to our ability to correlate the spectral, magnetic
              and thermal response to the chemical structure of this polymer.    This project
              in materials research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
              knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Central Europe
              to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence.  ??
