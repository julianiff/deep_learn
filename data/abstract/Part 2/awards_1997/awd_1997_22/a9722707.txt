              pedagogy takes place in a complex                                ecology of
              beliefs and values, held differently                                and in
              different ways by pupils, parents, teachers, and

                 becoming common because it recognizes                                and

                                                This revised proposal outlines a project
              designed to (i) synthesize and advance the  scientific foundations of
              assessment, (ii) monitor trends in science and mathematics assessment  in the
              U.S., and (i ii) improve public understanding of the purposes and meanings of 
              assessment and test scores. These three connected activities reflect a
              particular vision: of an  applied science of assessment that derives principles
              from basic science and builds on  systematic analysis of human learning
              processes in specific content areas.              At the core of this study is
              the recognition that advances in the science of human  learning over the last
              two or three decades provide a powerful scientific foundation for
