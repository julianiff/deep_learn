Abstract    :
              This two-year grant will provide detection equipment to  support an experimental
              program with radioactive nuclear  beams (RNBs) at the National Superconducting
              Cyclotron  Laboratory at Michigan State University (MSU) and at the  recently
              upgraded low-energy facility at the University of  Notre Dame(UND).  Special
              arrays of silicon position-  sensitive and fast-timing detectors will be used
              for a  variety of cross-section measurements: total reaction and  for neutron
              and proton removal, elastic scattering and  inelastic scattering (including
              Coulomb excitation), and RNB  transfer reactions and isomeric-beam induced
              reactions.  Measurements of the 1- and 2- neutron removal cross sections  from
              the neutron `halo` nuclei Li-11 and He-6 and He-8 and  the proton `halo` nuclei
              N-12 and Ne-17 are particularly  important.  The detectors will be used in the
              focal plane of  the S-800 Spectrometer at MSU and with the new double UM-UND 
              superconducting solenoid system at UND.  As part of the  project, several
              specialized detectors will be developed in  collaboration with US-based
              suppliers and DOE and NSF  supported national laboratories.  Several graduate
              and  undergraduate students will participate in the research  using these
              detectors.  This grant is made possible by the  support of the MPS Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities  equipment initiative.
