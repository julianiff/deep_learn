Abstract    :
              PI:  Hanlon  IBN:  9722805  Major advances in fundamental neurophysiology have
              come from studying the nervous system of the squid.  The giant axon, giant
              synapse, and the eyes are outstanding unusual features of squids that provide
              excellent model systems for neuroscience.  The Marine Biological Laboratory
              (MBL) in Woods Hole, Massachusetts has been a leading international center
              where physiologists, anatomists, biochemists and biophysicists have obtained
              squid for their research on nerve impulses, synaptic transmission, axonal
              transport and organelle motility, membrane structure, cell death and repair,
              and ion channel distribution and function.  This project continues partial
              funding for improved collection of live squid in good condition, using a
              variety of capture techniques.  Results of this support will have a broad
              impact because obtaining squid in excellent condition will enhance the
              potential of the new MBL Marine Resources Center facilities to provide longer
              and better maintenance, and so to provide healthier squid of consistently
              higher quality at a lower cost to the researchers in neuroscience.
