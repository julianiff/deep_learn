Abstract    :
              This three-year grant will support a faculty member and two  graduate students
              to continue and complete a high precision  measurement of charge symmetry
              breaking in neutron-proton  inelastic scattering at TRIUMF, byEmeasuring the
              small ( 1  per mil) forward-backward asymmetry in the produced deuteron 
              center-of-mass distribution.  It will also enable  participation in an
              experiment at the LEGS facility at  Brookhaven National Laboratory to carry out
              sum rule  measurements of the spin-dependent Compton amplitude through 
              measurements of the photodisintegration of the proton and  neutron from pion
              threshold to 470 MeV, as well as related  experiments in kaon electroproduction
              with the CLAS detector  facility at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator 
              Facility.  Partial support will be provided by the MPS  Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) as part of an  enabling initiative in
              instrumentation development; this  will help enable the CLAS effort.  Ohio
              University is also  providing support for equipment and partial support of a 
              post-doctoral fellow to enable this work.
