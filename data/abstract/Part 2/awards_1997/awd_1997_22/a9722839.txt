Abstract    :
                AST 97-22839  Andrea Dupree     This award supports a Workshop on Cool Stars,
              Stellar Systems, and the Sun, to be held 15-19 July 1997 in Cambridge, MA.  The
              meeting will focus on the interdisciplinary study of cool stars, including
              observations from the infrared to X-ray, and theory.  Current topics such as
              brown dwarfs, stellar activity cycles, high-resolution techniques and
              helioseismology/asteroseismology will be addressed by review talks; workshop
              sessions will treat topics such as rotation and lithium, abundances, evolved
              stars, and field T Tauri stars.  ***
