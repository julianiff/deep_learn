Abstract    :
              This international collaboration between the PI and Gerhard Michler at the
              Universitªt   Gesamthochschule Essen will develop a better fit between
              network-based parallel   architectures and applications.  The U.S. personnel
              are experts in computer architectures,   while the German group's expertise is
              in algebraic applications.  The interaction   collaboration between the two
              groups will result in ways to restructure underlying   algorithms and better
              support software for parallel computations, as well as generate   methods to
              reduce the current communications overhead between workstations.  Lessons  
              learned in solving problems associated with applications for parallel and
              distributed   systems will benefit many other applications areas.  In addition,
              flexible, stable, efficient,   and user-friendly parallel systems will greatly
              benefit the computational infrastructure of   science and engineering.  Through
              this project, the U.S. group will gain access to a highly   respected computer
              algebra group, and to the knowledge in the German national   computer-algebra
              focus program administered by the German equivalent of NSF.
