Abstract    :
              9722042  Steele    This Americas Program award will fund a joint USA-Argentina 
              workshop on aspects of  surface science, to be held in La  Plata, Argentina,
              November, 1997.  Organizers are Dr.  William Steele, Pennsylvania State
              University, and Dr.  Eduardo Bottani, Instituto de Investigaciones
              Fisicoquimicas  Teoricas y Applicadas (INIFTA), La Plata.  The workshop will 
              bring together scientists from US and Argentina to present  and discuss the
              most recent studies on surface science, and  explore the possibilities of
              collaboration in future work.  Modern surface science covers a wide variety of
              topics.  Subfields to be discussed in this workshop include surface 
              heterogeneity and its influence on the diffusion,  thermodynamics and chemical
              reactivity of molecules adsorbed  on such surfaces; methods of characterizing
              surface  heterogeneity, such as fractal dimension or the distance  dependence
              of the correlation between adsorption sites of a  given energy; and
              chemisorption and chemical reactivity on  well characterized surfaces.  These
              topics are at the  forefront of current research involving surfaces.    Surface
              science is a subject that has seen explosive growth  over the past two decades
              due to the introduction of  powerful new techniques for visualizing and
              characterizing  the species that form on the surfaces of chemically active 
              solids.   It is of enormous importance to catalysis, to  purification
              procesqes, to corrosion, wear and lubrication,  and to the fabrication of
              ever-smaller computer chips.  ***
