Abstract    :
                        INT-9722708  Balzer    This U.S.-Russian Workshop award is for
              "Russian Scientific and Industrial Policy: Moscow and the Regions" to be held
              at Georgetown University on 24 and 25 March 1997.  The principal researcher is
              Dr. Harley Balzer of Georgetown University.  Discussions Dr. Balzer has held
              with Russian science officials and scholars indicate now is an appropriate time
              to evaluate Russian government achievements during its first five years, and to
              assess proposals for future policy.  The first day of the conference will focus
              on Russian national scientific and industrial policy.  The second day will be
              devoted to local and regional aspects of these topics, with one session on
              developments in St. Petersburg and a second session examining other regions. 
              This session will be the first to assess Russian regional programs of
              scientific and technical development.        This workshop fulfills the program
              objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Russia to
              combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of
              benefit.    ***  ??
