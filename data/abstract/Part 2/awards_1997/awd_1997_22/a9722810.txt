Abstract    :
                          INT-9722810  Pittel    This U.S.-Bulgaria Collaborative Research is
              on "Nuclear Structure and its Applications."  The principal investigators are
              Dr. Stuart Pittel of the Bartol Research Institute in the U.S. and Dr. Mario V.
              Stoitsov of the Institute for Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy.  The
              researchers propose to focus on three problems of contemporary importance in
              nuclear structure physics.  One concerns a description of the structure of
              nuclear matter directly in terms of quark degrees of freedom through the use of
              baryon mapping techniques.  A second involves an improved calculation of the
              response of a new iodine detector to be 7Be solar neutrinos.  Both of these
              projects build naturally on earlier collaborative efforts between the PI and
              his Bulgarian colleagues.  The third, a study of the possible use of a simple
              analytic shell-model potential for the treatment of nuclei far from stability
              represents a new direction of research.    This research in physics fulfills
              the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and
              Bulgaria to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong
              mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and
              mutuality of benefit.    ***  ??
