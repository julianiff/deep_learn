Abstract    :
              9722262  Bargonetti         This career proposal is integrating laboratory 
              experiences and research into undergraduate and graduate  programs for students
              at Hunter college.  This investigator  is studying p53 as a cell cycle check
              point factor.  The  undergraduate students will examine the effect of  p53 on 
              the growth curves of mammalian cells in culture, and look at  the effects of
              p53 on transcriptional activation.  The  graduate students will look at the
              distribution of p53  during the cell cycle in cells before and after induced
              DNA  damage, and also look at the DNA binding properties and  phosphorylation
              state of p53.  These studies will provide  information on how p53 controls cell
              growth.  %%%    This career award is combining the research with the  training
              of undergraduate and graduate students at Hunter  College. Since Hunter College
              is a minority institution, a  number of underrepresented minorities will be
              trained in  this research which will provide important information on  how a
              protein, p53 acts to regulate the cell cycle.  ***
