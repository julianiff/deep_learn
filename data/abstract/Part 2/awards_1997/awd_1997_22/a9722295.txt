Abstract    :
                9722295  Ansari      Dr. Ansari intends to study the DNA helix-coil transition
              pathway, and identify and characterize possible intermediates along that
              pathway.  She intends to do this by initiating the uncoiling transition and
              monitoring the kinetics of relaxation back to equilibrium.  There is some
              evidence that suggests that flanking sequences outside a primary interaction
              site between a section of DNA and a ligand can render the DNA duplex more
              unstable, resulting in an increased reactivity with the ligand. The experiments
              described will ultimately contribute to our understanding of the interplay of
              the structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic characteristics of DNA and the
              recognition mechanisms of reacting ligands and proteins.    The educational
              goals will focus on integrating multidisciplinary studies into the curriculum
              of both undergraduate and graduate students.  The objectives are to introduce a
              Biophysics program that will synthesize existing courses offered in Physics,
              Chemistry and Biology Departments for an interdisciplinary degree.   In
              addition, a Molecular Biophysics course will be offered at the undergraduate
              level that will focus on the physical chemistry of biomolecules and introduce
              the students to research topics of current interest.  Effort will be made to
              reach out to high school students from Chicago schools, particularly from
              underrepresented minorities, for summer internships.
