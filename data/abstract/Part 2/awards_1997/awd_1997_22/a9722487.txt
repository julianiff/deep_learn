Abstract    :
              9722487  Biegler    This Americas Program award will fund a 2-year cooperative 
              research project between Dr. Lorenz T. Biegler, Carnegie  Mellon University,
              and Dr. J. Alberto Bandoni,  Planta  Piloto de Ingenieria Quimica (PLAPIQUI),
              Bahia Blanca,  Argentina.  The primary goal is to develop a software  platform
              for large-scale process optimization. This will  include leading edge
              algorithms for nonlinear programming,  and allow for the analysis and treatment
              of process  uncertainties in process optimization studies.  These  capabilities
              are not available in any large scale modeling  and design tools for process
              engineering.  The proposed  research will be devoted to three topics, executed
              in  sequence over the next two years.  They are: improvement of  optimization
              algorithms to solve larger problems more  efficiently and reliably; assessment
              of the influence  of  external parameters on the solution of the nonlinear 
              program, and; assessment of  the effects of uncertainty in  the design of
              chemical processes and related tasks.    In the last decade optimization
              strategies have seen  widespread application in process systems engineering and
               chemical manufacturing processes.  They have also led to the  implementation
              of nonlinear programming algorithms in  commercial process simulators and the
              application to large  detailed, process models.  However, there are still a
              number  of current needs in algorithmic development, formulation of 
              large-scale optimization problems, and implementation within  efficient and
              reliable software, requiring further  investigation.  This project will
              research some of these  topics.    ***
