Abstract    :
              Abstract  9722376  Beeson          This is a career award to determine the
              association between the  kinetics of early T cell activation and the
              biochemical and  functional response of T cells. During an immune response 
              antigenic peptides bound to proteins of the major  histocompatibility
              complex(MHC), bind to T cell receptors.  The  studies outlined in this award
              will correlate the structural  features of the reactions between peptide-MHC
              complexes and  specific T cell receptors with the biochemical reactions
              involved  in an immune response.  Computer models of peptide-MHC complexes 
              will be used to design altered peptides predicted to slightly  enhance or
              disrupt T-cell receptor binding.  This will be  accomplished by substitutions
              of amino acid residues with side  chains that interact with a TCR.  Such
              altered peptides are known  to block or modify normal immune responses.  The
              kinetics of the  reactions between these altered peptide-MHC ligands and T 
              cell receptors will be studied.  Changes in  intracellular  calcium, redox
              potential and cytokine release will be used to  relate the molecular events at
              the cell-cell interface with the  biochemical pathways responsible for the
              immune response.  For  the teaching component the investigator will incorporate
               biological topics into the curriculum of an organic chemistry  course. 
              Moreover his graduate and undergraduate students will be  doing research that
              involves chemistry, biochemistry and  immunology.  %%%    The studies outlined
              here will further our understanding of the  immune response, by examining in
              detail the molecular reactions  between the antigen and the T cell receptor and
              the biochemical  reactions which follow.      ***
