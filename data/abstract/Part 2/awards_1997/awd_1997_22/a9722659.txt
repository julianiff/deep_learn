Abstract    :
              This three-year grant will support research by a faculty  member, a Senior
              Research Associate and three graduate  students to investigate the structure of
              heavy nuclei  excited by Coulomb excitation reactions using heavy ion  beams. 
              The research makes use of the large gamma ray  detector array, Gammasphere,
              which is presently located at  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  During
              the period of  this grant this facility will be moved to the ATLAS facility  at
              Argonne National Laboratory to take advantage of other  beams available there. 
              Using NSF funds, the Rochester group  has constructed a 4-pi charged particle
              detector (Compact  Heavy Ion Counter) which can be used together with 
              Gammasphere to considerably enhance its utility for these  measurements. 
              Partial support will be provided by the MPS  Office of Multidisciplinary
              Activities (OMA), as part of an  enabling initiative in instrumentation
              development, to  provide for the modifications needed to CHICO in order to  use
              it at ATLAS and for needed computer hardware for data  analysis.  The Rochester
              group will continue using the  methods already developed in their past research
              to exploit  these new opportunities.
