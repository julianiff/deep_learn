Abstract    :
              This three-year award will support the research of a faculty  member, a
              postdoctoral fellow, and a graduate students to  participate in a program in
              relativistic heavy-ion research  at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL).  The
              experiment is  studying the flow of nuclear matter following Au-Au  collisions
              at various energies up to 10 GeV per nucleon. The  study of the high-density
              nuclear matter in these collisions  offers the possibility to determine the
              equation of state  for nuclear matter and possibly (although unlikely at these 
              energies) the discovery of a new state of matter, the quark-  gluon plasma. 
              The PI is also a member of the STAR  collaboration for the Relativistic Heavy
              Ion Collider (RHIC)  effort at BNL, which is scheduled to begin collecting data
               in September, 1999.  This grant will support the development  of tracking
              software for the Silicon Vertex Tracker and  extend it to integrate it with the
              existing tracking  software developed for the STAR Time Projection Chamber.
