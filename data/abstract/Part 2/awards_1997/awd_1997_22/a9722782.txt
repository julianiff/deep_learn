Abstract    :
              INT 9722782  Freericks      This U.S.-Croatian research project between James
              Freericks of Georgetown University and Veljko Zlatic of the University of
              Zagreb will work toward uniting newly developed theoretical tools to describe
              how electrons interact with phonons in real materials.    Specifically, the
              researchers intend to: 1) construct an accurate perturbative expansion for the
              electron-phonon interaction that includes the effects of a nonconstant electron
              density of states; and 2) compare the electronic spectral functions for the
              exact solution of a classical electron-phonon problem to the spectral functions
              determined by the conventional formalism.  This should determine the effects of
              nonconstant density states on the spectral features.  Results are expected to
              contribute to long-term efforts to construct a tunneling-inversion program that
              can incorporate nonconstant electronic density of states input from
              first-principles calculations.  Success could be applicable to our
              understanding of electron-phonon mediated superconductors.    This research in
              materials theory fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
              knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United State and Central Europe to
              combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence.              ??
