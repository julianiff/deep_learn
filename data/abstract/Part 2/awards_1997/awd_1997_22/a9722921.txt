Abstract    :
              The solution to many questions in evolutionary biology and  agricultural science
              depend on the accurate estimation of  the level of genetic variation and
              covariation present in  the populations being studied.  In this project, the 
              investigator is developing software for estimating  quantitative genetic
              parameters using statistical resampling  methods, as well as theoretically
              verifying the  applicability of these methods.  In addition, novel  techniques
              for comparing the pattern of genetic and  phenotypic variation and covariation
              between two or more  populations are also being developed and the software for 
              conducting these tests provided.    Tremendous advances in high performance
              computing over the  last decade have made it possible to address many difficult
               statistical problems by repeatedly recalculating the  statistical estimate
              after randomly resampling from the  population or sample under study. 
              Estimates of genetic  variation within populations, which are essential for 
              understanding how natural and artificial selection operate,  have complex
              statistical properties, making them especially  suitable for resampling
              approaches.  The software developed  in this project helps biologists in a
              variety of fields  analyze their experiments in more powerful and innovative 
              ways.  This work is supported by the Computational Biology  Activity and the
              Program in Population Biology (both BIO  programs).
