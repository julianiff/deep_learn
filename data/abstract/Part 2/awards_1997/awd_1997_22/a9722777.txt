Abstract    :
              INT 9722777  Beyerman      This U.S.-Czech research project between Ward
              Beyerman of the University of California-Riverside and Vladimir Sechovsky of
              Charles University, Prague, will examine magnetic, thermal, transport, and
              cohesive properties of strongly correlated electron systems under:  1)
              multi-extreme conditions of very low temperatures, 2) very high magnetic
              fields, and 3) high pressures.  The experimental data obtained will be compared
              to theoretical ab initio electron structure calculations which account for
              specific features of the electron structure and material parameters.  The
              researchers intend to concentrate on the influence of various external
              parameters in selected 4f- and 5f- narrow-band intermetallic compounds. 
              Results are expected to contribute to our understanding of a complex hierarchy
              of interactions and their role in different phenomena including: heavy fermion
              behavior, valance mixing, non-Fermi liquid scaling, weak magnetic order, band
              metamagnetism, huge anisotropy and giant magnetoresistance.  Such new knowledge
              may permit the design of novel materials useful in catalysis and refrigeration.
                 This project in materials research fulfills the program objectives of
              advancing basic scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United
              States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research
              resources in areas of mutual interest and competence.     ??
