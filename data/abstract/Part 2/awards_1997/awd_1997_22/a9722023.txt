Abstract    :
                   This project will address current problems in quark  models of strongly
              interacting particles and a related topic  in exotic atoms.  One problem
              concerns the production of  strange particles (sigma and lambda hyperons) and
              their  antiparticles from collisions of protons and antiprotons.  We will
              calculate in a quark model the cross-sections and  spin observables for these
              reactions, and compare them to  experiment and to meson-exchange calculations. 
              Our goal is  to determine the reaction mechanism and the unknown hyperon- 
              antihyperon interaction. Another problem of contemporary  interest is the
              contribution of strange quarks and  antiquarks to the spin of the proton.  We
              have proposed a  model of polarized, intrinsic strangeness in the proton  which
              we will further develop in order to test it against  spin transfer data from
              the hyperon production experiments.  A third problem is the asymmetry of
              different quark flavors  (up, down, and strange) in the sigma hyperon, which we
              will  calculate in a model in which mesons are coupled to quarks.  Finally, we
              will calculate energy level shifts and widths in  exotic atoms in order to
              learn about nucleon wave functions  and elementary hadron-nucleon interactions.
               Research  assistantships will be provided so that undergraduate  students can
              collaborate in this program.
