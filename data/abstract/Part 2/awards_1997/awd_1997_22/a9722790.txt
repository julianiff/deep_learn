Abstract    :
              9722790  Price   The goal of this project is to develop a vertebrate cell
              culture system for making targeted disruptions of telomere protein genes. This
              culture system will allow researchers to explore the role different telomere
              proteins play in telomere function. Vertebrate telomeres are large
              nucleoprotein complexes and these complexes are expected to be comprised of
              many different proteins. Targeted disruptions of the TRF1 gene, the gene
              encoding the first vertebrate telomere protein identified, will be made and the
              null phenotype analyzed. A chicken B-cell line that has an unusually high
              frequency of homologous recombination will be used. Mutant versions of the TRF1
              gene will be used to complement the null phenotype in order to dissect and
              understand the function of the protein.    This Career Advancement Award to Dr.
              Carolyn Price will allow her to gain the technical expertise and the in-depth
              knowledge necessary for a study of vertebrate telomere function. This
              sabbatical experience will allow her to switch her research program in her  own
              laboratory from investigations into the function of telomeres in ciliated
              protozoa to similar studies in vertebrates.
