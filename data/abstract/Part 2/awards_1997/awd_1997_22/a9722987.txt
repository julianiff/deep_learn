Abstract    :
                            9722987  Risley    Spermatogenesis is dependent upon a poorly
              understood, complex network of  hormonal, paracrine, and contact-mediated
              cellular interactions, the disruption of which may lead to temporary or
              permanent infertility. The proposed research will investigate the roles of gap
              junctions in mediating intercellular communication in the seminiferous tubules
              of testes. The working hypothesis is that gap junctions, assembled from diverse
              connexins, provide multiple, unique communication pathways between Sertoli and 
              spermatogenic cells in the seminiferous epithelium. To evaluate this overall
              hypothesis, connexin gene expression, assembly, and function in the
              seminiferous epithelium will be investigated. Connexin mRNA expression in
              spermatogenic cells, Sertoli cells, and peritubular cells will be studied using
              RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Immunocytochemistry and Western blotting will
              be used to assess connexin protein expression and assembly. The influence of
              reproductive hormones on connexin gene    expression and connexin assembly will
              also be studied using rats that have been hypophysectomized and placed on
              hormone-replacement therapy regimens. Finally, microinjection of various tracer
              dyes into seminiferous tubules will be employed to define gap junction coupling
              pathways at different tubule stages, and to determine if different junctions
              have unique permeability properties.
