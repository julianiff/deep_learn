Abstract    :
              The life histories of a number of fish species such as lamprey, sturgeon, and
              salmon include prolonged periods of voluntary fasting.  These periods, usually
              coincident with an upstream migration to the rivers and spawning, may last for
              several months after which the fish either restore feeding or expire.  Despite
              many attempts, it remains unknown what ecological or physiological signals
              suppress food intake and later, in some fish species, initiate it again.  The
              purpose of this project is to investigate whether fish food intake is linked to
              metabolic cues, primarily to body adiposity or controlled by coordinated
              network of hormones such as neuropeptide Y, insulin, leptin and glucagon-like
              peptide.  The expected results will expand the basic knowledge of regulation of
              appetite and food intake in non-mammalian vertebrates.  The practical
              application of the proposed work may eventually give fish culturists a tool for
              optimizing feeding regimes and, consequently, food utilization and body
              composition.  This, in turn, will diminish expenses of fish food, prevent as
              much as possible the body fat dependent phenomenon of early sexual maturation,
              and at the same time permit production of healthful food sources for humans.
