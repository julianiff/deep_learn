Abstract    :
              9722453  Green    This Americas Program award will fund a workshop on the 
              representation theory of algebras.  Participants are two  groups of
              mathematicians, headed by Dr. Edward L. Green,  Virginia Polytechnic Institute,
              and Dr. Roberto Martinez  Villa, Universidad Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM.). The
              main  objective is to strengthen  research efforts of both groups,  and broaden
              and diversify areas of interaction to bring new  ideas, methods and insights to
              the study of the  representation theory of finite dimensional algebras.  A 
              major goal of the project is the interchange of ideas and  techniques of the
              various areas of algebra that have not had  much interaction in the past.    To
              obtain such interactions, participants will  represent  three main areas of
              research: hopf algebras, quantum groups  representations of algebras, and group
              representations.  Graduate students and  junior researchers will be also be 
              invited to participate in the workshop.  ***
