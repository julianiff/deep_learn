Abstract    :
                   It is believed that a strongly correlated electron  system in two
              dimensions can be described by an effective  field theory of particles with
              fractional statistics called  anyons.  One important reason for the interest in
              models  with such an unusual statistics is the claim that anyons  could play a
              basic role in high-temperature  superconductivity.  Although anyon
              superconductivity has  been the subject of intense research in recent years, 
              problems still remain related to the anyon response to an  applied magnetic
              field at finite temperature.  This project  will address these questions. 
              Their solution will  contribute to a better understanding of the fundamental 
              properties of this system and to its relevance in condensed  matter.  The
              second part of this project will be dedicated  to the investigation of large
              magnetic fields in gauge  theories.  It is expected that the outcome of these
              studies  will be relevant for cosmic phase transitions and will  contribute to
              the explanation of the formation of electron  positron peaks in heavy-ion
              collisions.
