Abstract    :
                PI: Erskine, Mary S.  Proposal Number: IBN-9722804    Advances in molecular
              biology have led to the understanding  that certain genes, called "immediate
              early genes" become  expressed when cells become active. Techniques have been 
              developed to mark the cells expressing these genes,  including the cells of the
              central nervous system. This  symposium presents the work of scientists in
              several areas  of behavior and neuroscience as examples of the use of this 
              technique to mark systems in the brain that are responsive  to different types
              of sensory signals or are involved in  controlling a variety of behaviors. By
              holding the symposium  in conjunction with a national scientific meeting, the 
              organizers make information about this technique and its use  in behavioral
              research available to researchers and their  students in a wide range fields.
