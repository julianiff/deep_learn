Abstract    :
              Lay Abstract    PI: Ramirez, Julio J.  Proposal Number: IBN-9722829    Two areas
              of the brain that are very important for learning  and memory are the
              hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex.  When the hippocampus is deprived of its
              connections with the  entorhinal cortex, for example as a result of injury to
              the  brain, memory functions become impaired but recover within  two weeks
              after the injury. After injury, remaining areas of  the entorhinal cortex and
              other brain areas grow new  connections to the hippocampus. This project
              examines how  these new connections work together to mediate compensatory 
              changes in the brain and to promote the recovery of memory  functions. The
              project clarifies how different brain regions  involved in learning and memory
              work together and how they  interact following damage to compensate for that
              damage. In  addition to these specific contributions, the project  provides
              fundamental information about the capacity of brain  structures to reorganize
              and how such reorganization leads  to changes in function.
