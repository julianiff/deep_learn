Abstract    :
              This project will develop new applications of DNA in polymer  physics, in fields
              as diverse as adhesion, polymer brushes,  reptation, low dimensional systems,
              confined geometries, and  topological statistical mechanics.  It is expected
              that this  research will provide significant new progress towards the 
              resolution of open questions in these fields.  Specific  experiments that will
              be performed include the following.  The kinetics of adhesive fracture will be
              studied by  measuring the dynamic forces as two entangled polymers are 
              separated.  The static and dynamic behavior of a DNA brush  will be measured,
              thus testing the predictions of various  theories by providing a direct
              measurement of single  molecule configurations and dynamics.  The theory of 
              reptation will be critically examined by searching for  correlated motion of
              polymers in a melt.  Low dimensional  statistical mechanics will be studied by
              confining DNA in  microfabricated structures.  Finally, the effects of 
              topological knots on the statistical mechanical behavior of  DNA will be
              investigated by directed knot tying.  This research will be integrated with
              educational activities  on many levels.  Graduate students will be trained with
              an  interdisciplinary range of skills.  An upper level  undergraduate/first
              year graduate course on `The Biophysics  of DNA` will also be developed, that
              will serve to provide  an integrated curricula knitting together the various 
              theoretical and experimental applications of DNA to  biophysics, and vice
              versa.  This grant is made under the NSF `CAREER` Program.  Support  is
