Abstract    :
                   The purpose of the project is to construct and study  mathematically
              precise quantum field theory models.  The  broader goal is sharpen our
              understanding of quantum field  theory and increase its predictive power,
              thereby deepening  our understanding of elementary particle physics and 
              critical phenomena in statistical mechanics.  The project  particularly
              emphasizes the renormalization group.  This is  a widely applicable method for
              analyzing asymptotic behavior  in space or time, and another broad goal is to
              make  renormalization group techniques more precise, systematic,  and easy to
              use.  Specific project goals are: (1.) the  construction of non-Gaussian fixed
              points for the  renormalization group, and a study of the associated  anomalous
              critical exponents, (2.) the construction  of  quantum electrodynamics  and/or
              non-Abelian gauge theories  in three space-time dimensions, and (3.) the study
              of mass  generation in a scalar model simulating non-Abelian gauge  theories.
