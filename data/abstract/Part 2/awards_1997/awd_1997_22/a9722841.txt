Abstract    :
               This project involves an archaeologist from the University of Washington,
              studying the domestication of plants and animals and the development of complex
              societies in southwest Asia and northeast Africa.  Using standard
              archaeological techniques, the investigator will study the geomorphology,
              sedimentary, and botanical records of sites in the southeastern Sinai, as well
              as conduct area surveys.  The period to be studied is from about 10,000 to 6000
              years ago the `Pre Pottery Neolithic B`, an early stage in the transition from
              hunting and gathering to a domesticate-based subsistence economy and and the
              development of early complex societies in this region. It has always been
              assumed that contact between southwest Asia and Egypt was through northern
              Sinai and the Nile Delta.  However, there are hints in the archaeological
              record that contact may have been more important across southern Sinai and the
              Gulf of Suez.  The archaeology of southern Sinai remains largely unknown.  This
              research is designed to examine the role of southern Sinai in the introduction
              of some domestic animals, particularly sheep and goats, from southwest Asia
              into Egypt, and, during the later part of the period, what role southern Sinai
              may have played in the relationships between the developing civilizations of
              Mesopotamia and Upper Egypt.  The research should expand our understanding of
              this important period of time in this central  geographic location.
