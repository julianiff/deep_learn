Abstract    :
                        9722757  Delmer  A plasma-membrane-associated form of the sucrose
              synthase (SuSy) enzyme has been found that comprises more than half of the
              total SuSy activity of cotton fibers harvested at the most active stages of
              secondary wall cellulose deposition.  This is a surprising finding, because
              SuSy had always been considered a soluble enzyme.  This membrane form of SuSy
              could exist in a complex with cellulose synthase where it could serve to
              channel carbon from sucrose via the intermediate UDP-glc directly to the glucan
              synthase catalytic subunit.  The work will quantify the ratio of membrane-bound
              to soluble SuSy, and the biosynthetic pathway will be probed by in vivo
              labeling studies.  Consecutively, antisense approaches will be used to
              interfere with SuSy and sucrose-P synthase to affect cellulose biosynthesis.
