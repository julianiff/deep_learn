Abstract    :
                IBN-9722886  Mechanisms of Secretion (Conference)  PI: Thomas F.J. Martin,
              University of Wisconsin  co-PI: George J. Augustine, Duke University    This
              application seeks funding for an international research  conference on
              Mechanisms of Secretion.  Function in the  nervous and endocrine systems
              requires chemical  communication between cells.  Neurotransmitters bridge the 
              gap between nerve cells whereas protein hormones delivered  to the  bloodstream
              trigger physiological processes in various  tissues.  Both types of chemical
              signals are released from  cells by a similar process that involves the fusion
              of  secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane.  Understanding this process of
              membrane fusion and its  regulation is the focus of much active research. 
              Dramatic  progress over the last 3-4 years led to the identification  of
              several proteins that are required for  neurotransmitter release.  The
              discovery that very similar  proteins are involved in many other intracellular
              membrane  fusion events indicates that common principles govern  membrane
              fusion.  The goal of this conference is to bring  together scientists at the
              cutting edge of this research for  a lively and timely exchange of ideas on the
              recently-  emergent general principles in membrane fusion, and to  promote a
              translation of insights from biochemical,  molecular and genetic research to
              understanding  physiological mechanisms.  The conference is sponsored by  the
              Society for General Physiologists and will be held  September 4-6, 1997 in 
              Woods Hole, MA at the Marine Biological Laboratory as a  small meeting (~250
              participants).  In addition to 20  speakers in 5 sessions plus a keynote
              speaker, posters will  be presented at 3 sessions, and 8 short talks will be 
              programmed in 2 New Ideas sessions.  Accomodation awards to  10 grad
              students/postdocs will encourage participation by  young scientists. Sessions
              will cover: second messenger  regulation of secretion, proteins involved in
              secretion,  vesicle pools in secretion, membrane  fusion mechanisms and 
              endocytosis.  Dr. James Rothman will deliver the keynote  address on
              "Mechanisms and machinery of intracellular  protein transport."
