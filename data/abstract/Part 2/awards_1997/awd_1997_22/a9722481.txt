Abstract    :
              9722481  Frank    This Americas Program award will support travel and related 
              expenses for 10 US scientists to participate in a joint US-  Venezuela 
              Congress of Physiological Sciences, scheduled to  take place in Caracas,
              Venezuela, August 31 - September 5,  1997.  Organizers are Dr. Martin Frank,
              American  Physiological  Society and Dr. Sonia Torres, Venezuela  Society of
              Physiological Sciences.  The program will cover a  wide range of physiological
              sciences representing the broad  scope of investigations conducted by the
              scientists,  and  will provide a regional and local forum for the exchange of 
              physiological information and research data.  One of the  goals of the project
              is to encourage the development of  intellectual and research interactions
              between scientists  from US and Latin America.   Such interactions promote 
              scientific collaborations and create opportunities for  broadening the
              scientific experience of young  scientists.  ***
