Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical physics will include studies of  transport
              processes in matter at high densities and  temperatures that pertain to
              particle physics, nuclear  physics, plasma physics, astrophysics and condensed
              matter  physics.  A study of elementary processes associated with  the thermal
              evolution of neutron stars together with  interpreting the recent observational
              data will be  performed.  This study is important because neutron star  matter
              is unique (the densest stable matter in the universe)  in providing us with
              information that is not easily  accessible in laboratory experiments.  In
              addition, the  properties of a soon-to-be-created new plasma---the non- 
              relativistic electron-positron plasma---will be studied.  The importance of
              this study lies in deepening our  understanding of the plasma through
              comparison with  conventional plasma systems and, more importantly, helping 
              guide the experimental efforts in creating the electron-  positron plasma in
              the laboratory.
