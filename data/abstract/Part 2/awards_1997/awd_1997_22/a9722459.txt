Abstract    :
              9722459  Biesboer    This U.S.-Brazil award will support a research
              collaboration  between Dr. David D. Biesboer of the University of Minnesota 
              and Dr. Francisco Estevez of Federal University of Rio de  Janeiro in Brazil on
              the study of sustainable development  and nitrogen cycling in of Lagoa
              Imboacica, Rio de Janeiro  State, Brazil.    This research project will involve
              the study of basic  aspects of nitrogen cycling and nutrient uptake by aquatic 
              macrophytes in the tropical lagoons of Rio de Janeiro in  Brazil.  The goal is
              to determine the effectiveness of five  floating and emergent aquatic plant
              species to remove excess  nutrients and improve the quality of residential
              wastewater  flowing into the tropical lagoon, Lagoa Imboacica.  After  the
              successful completion of this study, the PIs will use  the resultant
              information in the creation of a model aquatic  plant wastewater treatment
              facility that will reduce the  environmental degradation of this lagoon.  The
              information  gathered from this project will serve to increase our 
              understanding of nitrogen cycling in tropical lagoons and  provide experience
              in artificial wetland design.    ***
