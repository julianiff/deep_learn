Abstract    :
              Cording  9722877    This award supports a three-year collaborative research 
              project between Dr. Edward Cording of the University of  Illinois and Dr.
              Hakmoon Kim of the University of Dankook in  Seoul, Korea on "Subsurface
              Construction, Resulting Ground  Movements, and Protection of the Built
              Environment."  The  project will involve 1) large-scale modeling, 2) collection
               and analysis of field data, 3) numerical analysis, and 4)  development of
              guidelines and recommendations related to  ground movement and building damage.
               The study will benefit  from data on the more than 100 construction-related 
              excavations currently underway in Seoul.    Excavations and tunnels are
              constructed adjacent to and  beneath thousands of buildings each year, and with
              each  instance, there is the possibility of damage to structures.  With ever
              increasing demands being placed on limited urban  space, subsurface
              construction projects will continue to  increase.  This research effort will
              combine the expertise,  facilities and data of the American and Korean research
               groups to assess how best to deal with potential damage to  structures due to
              nearby subsurface construction.  ***
