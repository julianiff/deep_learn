Abstract    :
              INT 9722819  White      This U.S.-Hungary research project between J. Michael
              White of the University of Texas, Austin, and Frigyes Solymosi of the Hungarian
              Academy of Sciences' Institute of Solid State and Radiochemistry, Szeged, will
              examine heterogeneous catalytic oxidation reactions of hydrocarbon and
              fluorocarbon molecules on single crystal transition metal surfaces. 
              Specifically, Hungarian participants will study reactivity of surface complexes
              that are key intermediates in catalytic reactions.  To accomplish this they
              will employ ultra-high vacuum chambers.  The U.S. team will focus on the
              dynamics of photon-driven oxidation reactions involving adsorbed reaction
              precursors by using a suite of surface sensitive spectroscopic methods. 
              Results are expected to contribute to our basic understanding of a broad range
              of oxidation reactions that occur between hydrocarbons and fluorocarbons at
              heterogeneous interfaces that have considerable societal impact on a global
              scale.    This project in analytical and surface chemistry fulfills the program
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
              United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.  ??
