Abstract    :
              INT 9722444  Manchester        This U.S.-Czech research project between Steven
              Manchester of the University of Florida and Zlatko Kvacek of Charles University
              will examine late Eocene to early Oligocene evolution and spread of mixed
              mesophytic (hardwood deciduous) forests in North America and Europe. 
              Specifically, the researchers intend to study the systematic relationships and
              biogeographic history of key genera shared between these floras of Europe and
              western North America.  Coniferous and dicotyledonous species will be featured,
              namely: Tetraclinis (Cupressaceae), Platanus (Platanaceae), Asterocarpinus,
              Ostrya (Betulaceae), Tilia and Craigia (Tiliaceae), and Hooleya (Juglandaceae).
                 The three-year collaborative effort will benefit greatly from access to
              important Central European botanical fossil collections that have been
              historically less accessible.  While results are expected to clarify the
              phylogenetic relationships, they will also contribute to our knowledge of the
              role of evolution in shaping modern deciduous hardwood assemblages and climatic
              zonation worldwide.    This paleobotanical research project fulfills the
              program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the
              United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.     ??
