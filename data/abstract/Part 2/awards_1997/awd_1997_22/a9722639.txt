Abstract    :
              ***  9722639  Kleppner  This program is the continuation of a set of experiments
               which have as their goal achieving Bose-Einstein  condensation in atomic
              hydrogen.  The first step of the  process is the trapping of the atoms in a
              cryogenic trap,  where densities approaching 10 14 atoms  cm-3 have been
              achieved.  Observation of the trapped  hydrogen is made by two-photon
              spectroscopy of the atom.  Observation of the condensate will be via a
              recoil-shifted  line that is unique to the condensate.  ***
