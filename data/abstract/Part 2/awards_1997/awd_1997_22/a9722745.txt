Abstract    :
                        INT-9722745  Edwards    This Joint U.S.-Polish Workshop on "Hot Topics
              in Quantum Optics" will take place in Jaszowiec, Poland, from 17-24 June 1997
              under the leadership of Dr. Mark Edwards of Georgia Southern University and
              Professor Kazimierz Rzazewski of the Institute for Theoretical Physics of the
              Polish Academy of Sciences.  The workshop will consist of two days of informal
              discussions surrounding two days of formal presentations.  The conference
              atmosphere will be one in which both junior and senior American and Polish
              researchers will participate in lively discussions.  A new feature of this
              workshop will be a major focus on Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) of trapped,
              cold atoms, currently a "hot" topic in quantum optics.  BEC discussion topics
              might include: thermodynamic properties of BEC's; cold-atom scattering; the
              atom laser; finite temperature excitation and damping in BEC's; and recent
              experimental results in BEC.  Other topics (and possible sub-topics) include:
              interaction of atoms with strong fields (atomic ionization and stabilization;
              high order harmonics; half-cycle pulses); quantum chaos (microwave ionization;
              modes of microwave resonators; level statistics);  Rydberg atoms in
              time-dependent fields (far-infrared multiphoton ionization; electron capture by
              elliptic Rydberg atoms; state-sensitive detection of Rydberg atoms); and
              quantum control (wavepacket control; scattering from Stark wavepackets;
              bound-state interferometry).      This workshop should result in many new
              collaborative research efforts in quantum optics between U.S. and Polish
              researchers.  It fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading
              experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and
              capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of
              equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.    ***  ??
