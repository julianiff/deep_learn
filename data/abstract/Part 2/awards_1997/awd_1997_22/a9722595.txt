Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the production of cold atoms of  antihydrogen and the
              ultimate high-precision spectroscopy  measurement of the 1S-2S transition
              frequency.  The  experiments utilize a nested Penning trap in which cold 
              positrons and antiprotons can be allowed to combine, and the  resulting atoms
              of hydrogen then trapped within the same  magnetic structure, where they can be
              spectroscopically  analyzed.  The experiments will be performed at the 
              Antiproton Decelerator (AD) facility at CERN as part of an  international
              collaboration that will involve research  groups from Harvard University and
              NIST in the United  States, from the Max Planck Institut fur Quantenoptik, the 
              Institut fur Kernphysik, and the University of Bonn in  Germany, and from the
              University of Amsterdam in Holland.  Funding for the AD construction is
              provided through a  Japanese contribution and through CERN.  It is expected
              that  the technical difficulties associated with the experiment  will prompt
              the development of new tools and techniques that  can find utilization in a
              number of areas in physics and  chemistry, and partial support is provided by
              the Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) in the Directorate for 
              Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
