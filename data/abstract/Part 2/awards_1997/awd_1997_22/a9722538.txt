Abstract    :
              This three-year grant will support a faculty member, a post-  doctoral fellow, 
              a graduate student and several  undergraduate students to perform a series of
              measurements  of the spin longitudinal nuclear response in the quasi-free  (QF)
              peak excitation region.  A long predicted enhancement  of the longitudinal
              response relative to the transverse  response, based on fundamental
              assumptions, has yet to be  observed experimentally.  The measurements will be
              performed  using the recently installed Indiana University Neutron  Polarimeter
              Facility (INPOL) at the Indiana University  Cyclotron Facility.  Excitation of
              the QF peak region in the  light nuclear systems 2H, 3He, and 4He will be
              measured, and  compared with previously obtained data from the heavier  systems
              12C, 40Ca and 208Pb by the same group.  The study of  the light systems allows
              a comparison to exact Faddeev-type  calculations, which are not possible with
              the heavier  nuclear systems, which will thus provide insight into the  source
              of the discrepancy.  Other experiments using INPOL  will provide measurements
              of low-lying Gamov-Teller Strength  in 40Ar, 59Co, and 127I targets; such
              information is  essential to properly calibrate measured neutrino fluxes in 
              proposed solar neutrino measurements.  The Ohio University  group will also
              take responsibility for the construction of  a neutron time-of flight wall for
              the BLAST detector at the  MIT-Bates facility and participate in measurements
              of kaon  electroproduction by the CLAS collaboration at the Thomas  Jefferson
              National Accelerator Facility.
