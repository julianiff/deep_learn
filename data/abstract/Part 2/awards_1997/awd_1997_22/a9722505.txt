Abstract    :
                This one-year award supports US-UK cooperative research on engineering of
              biomaterials   between Robert Latour of Clemson University and Larry Hench of
              Imperial College,   London, United Kingdom.  The objective of the research is
              to investigate model protein-  surface adsorption behavior.  The investigators
              will study the fundamental mechanisms   governing protein adsorption at the
              three basic levels of protein structure:  primary (amino   acid sequence),
              secondary (configuration of molecular chains in helices, sheets, and   loops),
              and tertiary (organization of secondary structures into the actual protein
              structure).    Following the implantation of a biomaterial into the body,
              proteins rapidly adsorb onto the   implant material's surface.  Biologic
              response and the body's reaction to the implanted   material are controlled by
              cellular reactions to this adsorbed protein layer.  This project   will advance
              our understanding of the mechanism controlling protein adsorption and  
              adsorbed protein conformation and contribute toward the long-range goal of
              designing   implant surfaces for controlled biologic response.  It takes
              advantage of British expertise   in biomaterials and protein sequencing at
              Imperial College and at the Interdisciplinary   Research Center in Biomedical
              Materials at the University of London.
