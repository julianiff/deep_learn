Abstract    :
                   It is now believed that the correct theory of the  strong nuclear force is
              Quantum Chromodynamics (called QCD),  the theory of quarks interacting with
              gluons to form  hadrons, the observed particles of nuclear physics.  The  goals
              of our research are to study the structure of hadrons  and atomic nuclei to
              investigate QCD and Electroweak  theories.       The hot early universe is
              believed to have consisted of  a quark vapor that underwent a phase transition
              to form  quark condensates and hadrons.  We are studying the  structure of
              these condensates as revealed in the properties  of hadrons, to be tested at
              Jefferson Laboratory and other  medium energy accelerators.  Our studies of the
              weak nuclear  force investigates aspects of quark condensates analagous to  the
              susceptibility of ferromagnets.  In collaborations with  Chinese theorists we
              study glueballs, quarkless hadrons, to  be tested at accelerators in the U.S.,
              China and Europe. We  are investigating hadrons at high temperature, with the
              hope  that some characteristics of the early universe phase  transition can be
              observed at the RHIC accelerator.  As part  of this research we develop models
              which can be used in the  analysis of medium energy experiments.
