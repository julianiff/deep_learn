Abstract    :
              Walsh  9722870    This award will support five undergraduate engineering 
              students and two faculty advisors to travel to Japan to  participate in the
              International Robot Grand Prix hosted by  the Tokyo Institute of Technology and
              to visit Japanese  university, government and corporate laboratories which 
              conduct research on robotics.  Dr. Gregory Walsh of the  Department of
              Mechanical Engineering, University of  Maryland, is the principal investigator
              for this project.  He organized and taught a senior level mechatronic design 
              course in which students designed and constructed an  autonomous mobile robot
              that will be entered in the Grand  Prix.    Robotics, which is becoming an
              increasingly important  generic technology, is an area in which the Japanese
              excel.  This project will enable a group of highly motivated U.S.  engineering
              students to have focused technical interactions  with Japanese students and
              researchers working in this  important area.  It is expected that exposure to
              the  Japanese laboratories, together with the interaction and  exchange of
              ideas with their Japanese counterparts, will  enable the American participants
              to initiate beneficial  collaborative research activities.  ***
