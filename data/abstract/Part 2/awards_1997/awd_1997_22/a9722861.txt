Abstract    :
                9722861  Si    This award supports participation of thirteen engineering 
              students in a summer research and education program between  Arizona State
              University, Tsinghua University, Beijing, and  Motorola.  The program will
              involve student participation in  engineering research projects within
              Motorola-China, with  supervision by Motorola engineers; research at Tsinghua
              on  multi-media software and on software design, and a  comparison of  Chinese
              and American educational systems.    Activities planned for this summer program
              are intended to  develop as cooperative projects enabling students to gain 
              access to the expertise, facilities, and unique environments  of China in ways
              that are mutually beneficial to the United  States and China.  Exposure to the
              Chinese education and  academic research systems, and to an overseas operation
              of a  major US multinational will provide important insights to  the student
              participants, promoting their ability to develop  as competitive professional
              engineers and engineering  researchers.    This project adds an international
              dimension to ECS 9553202,  a Presidential Faculty Fellows award.  Funding
              provided by  NSF will be matched by Motorola.
