Abstract    :
              Mori  DMS- 9722121    This is a highly multi-disciplinary proposal for research
              in modeling high intensity laser-matter interactions.  The experiments being
              modeled are rich and varied in phenomena, such as relativistic
              self-focusing/self-phase modulation, Raman scattering, and photon acceleration.
               In this work we will develop a three-dimensional particle-in-cell code to
              accurately simulate these interactions.  The accurate modeling of these
              experiments will lead to new understanding of laser-matter interactions.  The
              research requires expertise in high-intensity laser-plasma physics, laser
              plasma accelerations, large scale particle-in-cell computer modeling, and
              manipulation of large data sets.    Recently short-pulse laser technology has
              advanced to where there has been a great profusion of experimental results and
              the theoretical understanding of what is happening has not kept pace.  In this
              research, we will develop the capability to accurately simulate what happens
              when a high intensity short laser pulse interacts with matter.  The capability
              to model these interactions will help experimentalists interpret their results
              and increase our understanding of the physical processes involved.
