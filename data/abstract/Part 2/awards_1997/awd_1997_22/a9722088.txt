Abstract    :
                   I propose to investigate the role of sub-nucleon  degrees of freedom in low
              and medium energy processes.  In  particular processes of very short range like
              nucleon-  antinucleon annihilation and subsequent hadronization,  mainly into
              pions, will be investigated.       Microscopic models for annihilation and
              hadronization  are either based on nucleon degrees of freedom, or sub-  nucleon
              degrees of freedom, for example quarks and gluons.  A large amount of accurate
              data from the LEAR accelerator at  CERN on very specific annihilation modes of
              proton-  antiproton collisions over a wide energy range, are now  available. 
              These data allow for a detailed comparison of  experimental results with
              predictions from microscopic  models and draw conclusions about their validity.
                    In particular the spin dependence of the observables  promises to be a
              stringent test on the models. A further  test is if a consistent description of
              annihilation into  three as well as two mesons can be found.
