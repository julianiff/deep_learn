Abstract    :
                    9722978  Bradford  Seed germination is a critical developmental transition
              in the plant life cycle. While seeds are generally quite tolerant of
              environmental stresses, seedlings are highly vulnerable to extremes of
              temperature or water availability. Considering that our understanding of the
              molecular events that lead to germination is scant, the work proposed here is
              designed to provide molecular markers for seed germination. One obstacle to a
              better understanding is that seeds, even from a genetically uniform background,
              germinate at different times. The work will study the mechanisms that lead to
              this heterogeneity using the expression of GFP reporters under the control of
              promoters for germination-specific genes which are available. Not only will the
              pattern of expression be monitored, the reporter protein will be used to select
              stages of germination. Additionally, the influence of plant growth regulators
              on the activity of these promoters in seeds with different degree of dormancy
              or germination will be studied.  The application of results from this work for
              the agronomically important trait  germination  is obvious.
