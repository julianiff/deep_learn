Abstract    :
                   Research will be performed in two areas of theoretical  high energy
              physics: phenomenology and fundamental theory.  The first is concerned with
              theoretical predictions (based  on a new symmetry of nature: supersymmetry) of
              an array of  ongoing experiments to discover new principles of how  particles
              interact.  These include testing of whether the  proton is stable or whether it
              decays into lighter  particles, detection of cosmological dark matter whose 
              composition is as yet unknown but is believed to make up  more than 90% of the
              matter of the universe, etc.  This  research is exciting in that any of these
              experiments could  revolutionize our understanding of particle theory.  The 
              second area is concerned with superstring theory, an effort  to unify all the
              forces of nature including gravity into a  single theory.  Research here is
              concerned with 11  dimensional M-theory (of which 7 dimensions are compactified
               into a very small volume)to resolve outstanding problems of  black hole
              physics, the quantum theory of supermembranes,  etc.  This research aims at the
              exciting possibility of the  discovery of a fundamental new theory of all
              particle  physics.
