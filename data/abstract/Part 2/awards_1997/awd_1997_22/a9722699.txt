Abstract    :
              Oh  9722699    This award supports a two-year collaborative research  project
              between Dr. Hae-Soo Oh of the University of North  Carolina at Charlotte and
              Dr. Jae Heon Yun of Chungbuk  National University in Korea on a "New Method To
              Obtain  Highly Accurate Three Dimensional Analysis of Crack  Propagation and
              Stress on Composite Materials."  The goal of  the project is to develop a new
              method for numerical  simulation of crack propagation which deals with the
              three-  dimensional singularities of vertex, edge and edge-vertex.   
              Fracture-related damage, metal fatigue and material failure  are critically
              important issues in the context of our  national civil infrastructure. 
              Effective inspection and  preventive maintenance programs (for example, of the 
              airworthiness of airplanes or the integrity of nuclear power  plants) require
              an accurate fracture analysis.  However,  because of the complicated geometry
              and nonlinearities that  characterize fracture mechanics, the use of analytical
               techniques is very limited.   This project will combine the  experience of the
              U.S. and Korean laboratories to work on a  practical and accurate numerical
              simulation for three  dimensional fracture analysis.  ***
