Abstract    :
              9722498  Keeler    This award will support travel and related expenses for Drs. 
              Kathleen  Keeler, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, and Jane  H. Block,
              University of Colorado, Boulder, for a meeting  with Drs. Guillermo Norrmann
              and Camilo Quairn, Universidad  del Nordeste, Corrientes, Argentina.  The
              purpose of the  visit is to develop a joint research project to investigate 
              the role of intraspecific polyploidy in the evolutionary  success of grasses,
              using Andropogon as a model system.  The  consultation will allow the two teams
              to exchange  information on preliminary studies and to plan coordinated 
              activities and field trips to look at related species.    The topic of the
              research is of considerable interest to NSF  because many plant species are
              polyploid and because many  species, especially the grasses,  occur in
              polyploid  complexes that appear to be the result of autopolyploidy.  The
              research will likely contribute to advance the  understanding of this important
              dimension of plant  evolution.  ***
