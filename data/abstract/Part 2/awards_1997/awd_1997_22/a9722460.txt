Abstract    :
              9722460  Bronner-Fraser    This  Americas  Program award will support Dr.
              Marianne  Bronner-  Fraser,   California  Institute  of  Technology,  in  a 
              research  collaboration with Dr. Roberto Mayor, Universidad de Chile.   The 
              investigators plan to study the effect of expression of  a  newly  isolated 
              gene,  NP-1, on the initial formation of  neural  crest  cells.   The new gene,
              isolated and sequenced from avian  embryos  by  Dr. Bronner in collaboration
              with two other researchers,  has  no  obvious similarities to other known gene
              families.   However,  although  the  chick system has many  advantages for
              experimental  embryology, it is difficult to ectopically express gene  products
               in  birds.  Therefore, the researchers have initiated studies  of  the 
              Xenopus system, which represents an ideal system in which to  pursue ectopic
              expression of molecules in early development.   To  that  effect. they plan to
              isolate the Xenopus homologue of NP-!.  Their research will combine molecular
              biological approaches  with  experimental  embryology, with the long-term goal
              to characterize  and   understand  the  function  of  the  gene  in  neural 
              crest  formation.    The   collaboration  will  benefit  greatly  from  the  
              combined  expertise and research intereqt of both researchers. The proposed 
              experiments will take place in Dr. Mayor's laboratory, who is  an  expert on
              the Xenopus system and has a long standing interest  in  neural crest
              development.  .  ***
