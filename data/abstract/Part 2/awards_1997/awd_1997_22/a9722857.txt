Abstract    :
              This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              UCLA studying the changing patterns of resource consumption and land use among
              the Machiguenga Indians of the southeastern Peruvian Amazon.  During the past
              30 years missionaries, NGOs and government agents have sedentized and
              centralized the previously semi-nomadic subsistence-focused Machiguenga into
              small villages with increasing market integration. The student will draw upon
              theories from experimental economics to advance our understanding of the
              transmission and decision-making processes that produce socio-cultural change. 
              Methodologically, the student will administer laboratory style tests aimed at
              gathering data on how the Indians reason and respond under various economic
              circumstances.  This data will be comparable to data gathered from people in
              fully commercialized developed societies, such as the US.  Second, through
              detailed ethnographic investigation, the student will explore current patterns
              of resource use and labor allocation with a focus on cultural transmission. 
              This research is important because it will advance our understanding of how
              humans make economic decisions in diverse contexts.  By systematically
              comparing how cultural patterns relate to individualized decision models as
              opposed to differential transmission of ideas in this relatively non-market,
              non-capitalist context, the project advance our understanding of the
              fundamentals of human economic behavior.
