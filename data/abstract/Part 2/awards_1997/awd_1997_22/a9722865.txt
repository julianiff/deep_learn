Abstract    :
              9722865  West/King  The aim of the proposed research is to explore the role of 
              different kinds of sensory experience on the ontogeny of avian  communication,
              with a focus on reproductive skills and underlying  neuroanatomical structures.
              Three objectives are outlined, using  an avian  model. First, the influence of
              adult stimulation on juvenile  learners will  be examined in a series of
              longitudinal studies. Measures of the  effects of  experience include vocal
              growth, vocal imitation, use of vocal  signals,  visual attention, and
              reproductive skills. Second, characteristics  of  female perception will be
              studied with special emphasis on  modifiability of  female mating preferences.
              New evidence suggests contextual  influences on  female preferences. Measures
              of preference include female  responsiveness to  auditory playback and female
              discrimination of potential mates.  Finally,  neural studies of the avian
              forebrain are planned to exploit new  findings  on females' use of song nuclei
              and males' use of a visual thalamic  nucleus.  The results of the proposed work
              should advance knowledge of the  nature of  developmental organization of vocal
              and perceptual learning and  the  integration of behavioral and neural
              plasticity.  Finally, the  neural  analyses should broaden our understanding of
              the role of forebrain  structures by revealing interdependencies between
              patterns of  neural growth  and availability of relevant ecological experience.
