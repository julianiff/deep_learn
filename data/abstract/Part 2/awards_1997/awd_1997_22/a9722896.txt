Abstract    :
              9722896  Hernandez  The "Mechanisms of Eucaryotic Transcription" conference will
              be an open international meeting devoted to the most recent advances in the
              rapidly evolving field of eucaryotic transcription. This meeting follows four
              highly successful meetings on the same topic held in Cold Spring Harbor in
              1989, 1991, 1993, and 1995, and will be organized according to the same basic
              format.  The meeting will be open with attendance limited only by the
              facilities available to a maximum of 425 participants.  Oral presentations will
              consist of a combination of invited presentations and selected presentations
              from submitted abstracts.  This ensures the participation of junior and senior
              leaders in the field and the presentation of the most exciting results emerging
              at the time of the meeting. The oral presentations will be complemented by
              poster presentations in three poster sessions, also selected from submitted
              abstracts.  The areas covered by the meeting on "Mechanisms of Eucaryotic
              Transcription" include studies on 1) the structure and function of the basal
              transcription apparatus, 2) the regulation of RNA polymerase activity, 3)
              activation mechanisms involving interactions between activators and the basal
              transcription machinery, 4) the structure and function of regulatory complexes,
              5) chromatin structure and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, and 6) repression
              mechanisms. A number of eucaryotic systems including mammalian, Drosophila, and
              yeast, will be represented along with selected procaryotic topics to create a
              didactic conference.  The aim of the conference, "Mechanisms of Eucaryotic
              Transcription", is to bring together scientists working in this rapidly
              developing field so that the latest results can be discussed, critically
              evaluated, and fitted into a general picture.  Transcription of a gene is the
              first step in its expression.  Although many meetings contain a few sessions on
              transcription, there are few meetings that are devoted entirely to the topic of
              how transcription is achiev ed and regulated in the cell.  ***
