Abstract    :
              INT 9722620  Hickey      This U.S-Czech research project between William Hickey
              of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Vladimir Brenner of the Czech
              Institute of Microbiology, Prague, will characterize chlorobenzoate
              biodegradation genes (ohb): Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain JB2 and Pseudomonas
              putida strain P111.  The researchers expect that this examination of a key
              aspect of PCB mineralization will lead to a better understanding of the impact
              of PCBs on the evolution of metabolic pathways in soil bacteria.    The
              collaborative effort will involve isolation and characterization of the ohb
              genes by genomic library construction/screening, nucleotide sequence analysis
              and metabolism studies.  Recombinant PCB-mineralizing strains will be
              constructed by using a broad host-range suicide delivery system to introduce
              the ohb genes into biphenyl degraders isolated from PCB contaminated sites in
              the Czech Republic.  These strains will then be tested for efficacy in
              mineralizing PCBs in soil by using PCB mixtures.  Overall, results are expected
              to contribute insight in developing cost effective approaches for
              bioremediation of PCBs, an important class of environmental pollutants.    This
              project in metabolic biochemistry fulfills the program objective of advancing
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence.         ??
