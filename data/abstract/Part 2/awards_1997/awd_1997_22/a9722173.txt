Abstract    :
              9722173  McCammon  New theoretical and computational methods for computer
              simulation studies of biomolecular systems will be developed.  These methods
              will be applied to help explain the activity of several systems of chemical and
              biological interest.  The new methods will include extensions of the molecular
              dynamics simulation method, with modifications to allow for faster sampling and
              quantum dynamical features.  Applications will be made to acetylcholinesterase
              and other biomolecules.    The goal of this work is to develop new theoretical
              and computational methods to investigate the structure and function and
              interactions of biological macromolecules.  Biological macromolecules that
              serve as receptors for biologically active molecules, such as hormones, and
              flexible molecules; computer simulations describe the structural adjustments of
              the molecules as they interact.  The basic understanding of these molecular
              interactions is the key to many practical applications, including rational drug
              design.   ***
