Abstract    :
                    9722377  Delaney  Based on a mutant screen, SA insensitivity, the PI has
              identified a gene, nim1, which he proposes to use for the detection of
              suppressor mutants.  The objectives of the research include the
              characterization of such suppressor mutant lines, to obtain additional insight
              into reactions downstream of NIM1.  Another objective is the search for novel
              pathogen-induced genes in mutant lines in which SAR is disabled.  For this,
              differential display techniques will be used.  Finally, a mutant screen is
              developed which will identify additional components of the disease resistance
              syndrome which function in the nim1 background.  A teaching component included
              in the funded work will bring genetic analysis into the K-12 curriculum.
