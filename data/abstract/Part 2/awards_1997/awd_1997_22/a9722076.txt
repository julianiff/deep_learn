Abstract    :
                   This proposal continues a program of basic research in  nuclear physics. 
              It is known that `nucleons` (protons and  neutrons) are composed of subunits
              called `quarks`.  In low  energy nuclear physics a property called `charge
              symmetry`  is well preserved.  It is assumed (with little experimental 
              evidence) to be equally valid at high energies.  This  project investigates
              whether charge symmetry is broken at  high energies.  We suggest precise
              experiments to improve  our understanding of charge symmetry.  We also relate
              charge  symmetry to another property called flavor symmetry, which  states that
              different `types` of quarks should contribute  equally in protons and neutrons.
                    We also study the motion of particles in very narrow  two dimensional
              systems.  All particles possess `wavelike`  properties.  When system dimensions
              are commensurate with a  particle's wavelength, dramatic results occur.  We
              were the  first to demonstrate that a particle in a bent tube  possesses bound
              states.  We study both theory and experiment  for such states, in both tubes
              and wave guides.  We also  study the onset of `turbulence` when particles move
              through  bent tubes.
