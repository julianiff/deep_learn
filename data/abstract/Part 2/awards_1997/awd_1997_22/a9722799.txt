Abstract    :
              9722799  Litvin    This grant supports the research on the symmetry 
              classification of domain structures.  The PI is a co-author  and a co-editor of
              the "International Tables of  Crystallography" and is currently working on non
              magnetic  subperiodic and magnetic space groups and subperiodic  groups.  This
              work is carried out with active participation  of the undergraduate students at
              a predominantly  undergraduate institution-Penn State, Berks Campus.  The  work
              on crystallographic tables is a service to the  community of enormous
              importance.  The PI's research is  expected to enhance our understanding of
              symmetry properties  of crystal growth and also of magnetic domain walls.  %%% 
              This PI from a predominantly undergraduate institution (Penn  State/Berks) is a
              co author and co-editor of the  "International  Tables of Crystallography". 
              These are the  authoritative reference works on the subject of symmetry 
              properties of crystals.  He also does research, involving  undergraduate
              students, into the cutting edge elements of  this subject, for example magnetic
              and non-magnetic space  groups and subperiodic groups.  His work finds
              applications  in a better understanding of properties of domains and  twins.
