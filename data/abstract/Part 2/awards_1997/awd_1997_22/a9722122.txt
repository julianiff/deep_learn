Abstract    :
                   I will conduct theoretical research in the field of  intermediate and
              low-energy nuclear physics.  The projects  share, in the main, the methods and
              models of the few-body  problem, attention to the successful phenomenology of
              the  strong interaction at the hadronic and at the quark level,  and use of the
              electromagnetic interaction as a probe of  properties of systems bound by the
              strong interaction.  I  will continue a study of the spin structure of $^6$Li 
              because it is being used as a target of polarized neutrons  for high-energy
              experiments which seek to understand the  quark-gluon structure of the nucleon.
               Other projects in  medium energy physics include pion production at threshold 
              in nucleon-nucleon collisions, and pion photo- and  electroproduction from
              nucleons at threshold.  I will  continue to study meson mixing related to the
              charge  asymmetry in the nuclear force, and attempt to extract  low  energy
              Lambda-neutron scattering parameters from radiative  kaon capture on the
              deuteron.  The projects are intended  develop our understanding of the strong
              interaction,  especially as it manifests itself in few nucleon systems,  and to
              support current experimental work being done in  Europe and North America.
