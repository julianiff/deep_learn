Abstract    :
                        97-22915  Kende  The work is based on physiological/ biochemical
              analysis of the interplay between different plant growth regulators, ethylene,
              ABA, GA, in the regulation of growth.  The objectives of the continuing
              research include the analysis of gene expression changes in response to GA, the
              primary mediator stimulating growth. Included is an analysis of the role of
              expansins in the elongation of deepwater rice internodes, and analysis of the
              action of ethylene which stimulates elongation growth by promoting the turnover
              of ABA which would otherwise inhibit growth.  Finally, transformation of rice
              is being done to test the function of the isolated genes, GA-induced, in
              transgenic rice.
