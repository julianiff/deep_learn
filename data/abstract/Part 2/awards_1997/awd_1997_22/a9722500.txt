Abstract    :
              Yasbin  9722500  The 41st annual meeting of the Wind River Conference on
              Procaryotic Biology is to be held at the Lazy H Ranch, Allenspark, Colorado,
              June 4-8, 1997.  8This conference is primarily concerned with the biology of
              prokaryotes, and is the major annually occurring meeting devoted to this
              subject area.  One significant feature of these meetings is their accessibility
              to graduate students and post-doctoral students, whose travel funds frequently
              are limited.  Specifically to address this problem, funds will be used to
              provide travel and support scholarships to facilitate the attendance of
              graduate students and post-doctoral students working in various areas that
              comprise prokaryotic biology.
