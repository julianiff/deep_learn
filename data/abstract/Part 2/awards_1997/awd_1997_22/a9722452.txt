Abstract    :
              9722452  Blake    This U.S.-Mexico Collaborative Program award will support  Dr.
              John Blake and Ms. Catherine Graham of the University of  Missouri-Saint Louis,
              in a research collaboration with Dr.  Sergio Guevara, of the Institute of
              Ecology in Xalapa,  Mexico. The researchers aim to understand the effects of 
              forest fragmentation on patterns of habitat selection and  movement by
              fruit-eating birds.  This understanding is  important because birds disseminate
              the seeds of many  tropical forest plants.  For this study, the researchers 
              will examine the relative influence of patch-level  (vegetation structure,
              fruit abundance) and landscape-level  factors (habitat placement in the
              landscape) on patterns of  habitat use by studying  bird use of three common
              habitat  types in a landscape dominated by pasture in the Los Tuxtlas  region
              of Veracruz, Mexico.    The research will have three basic objectives: 1) 
              determination of use patterns of distinct habitat types; 2)  development of a
              series of hypotheses (matrix models) to  predict bird movement; and 3)
              validation and refinement of  these models through comparison with an
              independently  derived data set on movement patterns.  The Mexican 
              counterparts at the Institute of Ecology in Xalapa have been  studying the role
              of isolated fig species in promoting seed  dispersal by fruit-eating
              vertebrates in Los Tuxtlas.  Data  collected in this study will complement the
              work of these  collaborators by examining the roles of patches and riparian 
              corridors in patterns of habitat selection and movement  by  fruit-eating
              birds.  ***
