Abstract    :
                   Theoretical investigations and calculations of low-  energy hadron
              properties and interactions are being  conducted in terms of quark and gluon
              constituents by  modeling the large distance behavior of the relativistic 
              field theory known as Quantum Chromodynamics.  Two  complementary lines of
              investigation are being followed.  The first involves truncation of the
              Dyson-Schwinger  equations of motion, and the second involves use of a model 
              quark field theory to produce an effective field theory of  mesons.  Specific
              topics being addressed include meson  masses and decays, meson-meson and
              meson-nucleon interaction  coupling constants and form factors, and
              electromagnetic  form factors.  The experimental issues being confronted now 
              in experiments at the Jefferson Laboratory are of primary  concern within this
              research program.  An extension is being  made to address these matters at
              finite temperature and  matter density for application to the experimental
              program  at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider facility under  construction. 
              The investigations are designed to put onto a  theoretical basis those aspects
              of meson interactions and  electromagnetic couplings that have in the past been
              mainly  phenomenological.
