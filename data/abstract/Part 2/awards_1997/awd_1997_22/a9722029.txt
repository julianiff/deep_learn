Abstract    :
                This three-year award for US-UK cooperative research in physical experimental
              chemistry   involves David W. Pratt of the University of Pittsburgh and W.G.
              Richards and J.P.   Simons at Oxford University.  The objective of their
              research is to study supramolecule   assemblies of enzyme catalytic sites and
              bound substrates, including structure and   properties of the supramolecule
              assemblies and interaction among its components.    Enzyme and enzyme substrate
              mimics, designed to model the behavior of the enzymes,   serine and cysteine
              proteases, will be studied in experiments using laser-based electronic  
              spectroscopy and other techniques.  They will also use the enzyme mimics to
              investigate   selective binding of xenon at enzyme catalytic sites, thereby
              providing insight into its   potential as a site specific stain in magnetic
              resonance imaging.  The US investigator and his group bring to this
              collaboration expertise in characterization   of enzyme structures using
              theoretical techniques.  This is complemented by British   expertise in enzyme
              mimic preparation and characterization using ab initio techniques.    These
              studies will provide new information about molecular interactions which are  
              responsible for enzyme function.
