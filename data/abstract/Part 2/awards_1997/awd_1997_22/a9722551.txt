Abstract    :
              9722551  Sanchez    This Americas Program award  requests support for a 
              workshop on the modification, characterization, and  modeling of surfaces, to
              be held in Buenos Aires,  Argentina, on July 14-26, 1997.  Organizers are Dr. 
              Juan M. Sanchez, University of Texas, Austin, and Jose  R. Galvele, Universidad
              Nacional San Martin, Argentina.  Support is requested for travel and related
              expenses  for five senior scientists, two graduate students, and  a
              post-doctoral research scientist. The workshop aims  to provide a forum for
              discussion of current  developments in an important area of science and 
              technology.  The subjects to be discussed are modeling  of surfaces and
              interfaces; processing and fabrication  of thin films; laser and ion beams
              processing of  surfaces and interfaces; and tribology.    In addition to the
              participation of the US scientists,  lectures will be presented by experts on
              different  aspects of surface science and engineering from  Argentina, Brazil,
              France, Germany, and Switzerland.  ***
