Abstract    :
              9722464  Peterson    This award will support Dr. R. J. Peterson of the
              University  of Colorado, to go to Brazil to work with Dr. Solange de  Barros at
              the University of Rio de Janeiro on the study of  pion-induced fission.   
              Fission is used as a diagnostic to determine the mechanism  of reactions
              induced by many beams, and internally produced  pions are important to those
              mechanisms.  These researchers  have collected data with monoenergetic pion
              beams which have  set benchmarks for any reaction models that directly or 
              indirectly involve pions.  This grant will enable them to  complete this work,
              and start the integration of the results  into related fields of high energy
              nuclear reactions.      ***
