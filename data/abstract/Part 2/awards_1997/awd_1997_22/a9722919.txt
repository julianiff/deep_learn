Abstract    :
                9722919  Wang    This award supports cooperative research in symbolic 
              computation algorithms and systems for polynomial  computations between Paul
              Wang, Kent State University,  Institute for Computational Mathematics, and Liu
              Zhuojun,  Mathematics Mechanization Research Center, Institute of  Systems
              Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The  cooperation brings together the
              knowledge, expertise, and  experience in parallel symbolic computing of the 
              mathematical computation group at Kent State and the  sophisticated knowledge
              of Groebner bases and characteristic  sets of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
              group.    Given the strengths of the research teams in both the US and  China,
              there is good potential for significant advances from  the research. Such
              advances could be useful to applications  ranging from operations research to
              airline scheduling.
