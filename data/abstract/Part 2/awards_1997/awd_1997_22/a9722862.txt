Abstract    :
              The investigator and his colleagues are developing new  theory and computational
              algorithms to improve and extend  current methods for analysis of biological
              macromolecules  and their assemblies by x-ray diffraction analysis.  The new 
              algorithms specifically target problems where the molecules  are, or can be,
              oriented, but not crystallized.  The number  of such systems is large;
              including nucleic acids, muscle  proteins, viruses, bacteriophages and some
              membrane  proteins.  These new algorithms will extend current methods  to
              systems that are currently inaccessible, and will reduce  the time and cost
              involved in such studies.  The structural  information obtained from such
              studies contributes to our  understanding or the structure-function
              relationships in  such systems.    The manipulation of biological molecules and
              processes is  fundamental to the prevention and treatment of disease, and  to
              the development of new, and environmentally friendly,  biomaterials.  Success
              depends, however, on a detailed  understanding of the structure of the
              molecules at the  atomic level, and relationships to their behavior and 
              properties.  This project is concerned with new  computational methods for
              studying the atomic structures of  certain biological molecules using x-ray
              diffraction  analysis.  The approach is a synthesis of techniques from 
              mathematics and modern computing, to model and analyze  biological systems. 
              The new algorithms being developed will  broaden the scope, and improve the
              efficiency, of such  investigations.
