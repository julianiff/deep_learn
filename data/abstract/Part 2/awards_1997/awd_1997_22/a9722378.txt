Abstract    :
              9722378  Robertson    Ion channels are proteins that allow the flow of ions
              across  cell membranes.  The movement of the charged ions produces  electrical
              activity that is the basis of communication in  the brain. The long-range goal
              of this research is to  understand how the Eag family of potassium channels 
              contribute to electrical signaling in the nervous system.  Although these
              channels can be detected biochemically, their  functional properties and
              physiological roles are unknown.  The specific aims of the project include a
              combined  electrophysiological and pharmacological approach to  characterize
              currents produced by these channels in brain  tissue slice.  A simpler
              "expression system" containing pure  populations of these channels will be used
              to further  characterize factors that control the opening and closing,  or
              "gating," of the channels. These research activities  involve undergraduates in
              an integrated, supervised program  in which students cooperate in the design,
              execution and  analysis of experiments.  They will report their findings at 
              scientific meetings and in manuscripts for publication, thus  developing
              writing and communication skills in a scientific  setting.  The educational
              goal of the project is to provide  these students the opportunity for
              scientific discovery in  an active learning paradigm not typically available to
               undergraduates, and to develop the skills and self-  confidence necessary to
              pursue careers in science.
