Abstract    :
              9722988  Phillips  Soil bacteria have evolved sophisticated mechanisms for
              coexisting with plant roots.  The focus is on the interaction of Rhizobium
              meliloti and alfalfa.  The work is based on the previous detection of a
              bacterial factor that stimulated root respiration, although the factor is
              structurally not identical to the known lipo-chitin oligosaccharide signals
              involved in nodulation.  In addition, the factor does not induce roothair
              curling and its synthesis is not dependent on the presence of roots.  The work
              will characterize this factor and determine its structure.  Bacterial mutants
              which do not synthesize the factor will also be characterized to unravel the
              biosynthetic pathway.  Finally, the purified compound and the bacterial mutant
              strains will be used to study alterations in root colonization, signaling
              between the symbiotic partners and plant responses.
