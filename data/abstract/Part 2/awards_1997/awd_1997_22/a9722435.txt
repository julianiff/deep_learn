Abstract    :
              9722435  Agris  Many different groups are using a variety of approaches to
              understand the plasticity of RNA and how RNA structure is recognized by other
              RNAs and small molecules.  A symposium on RNA will thus be very timely.  Nine
              major researchers (from the USA, Europe, and Canada) have accepted invitations
              to speak at a Symposium on October 17-19, 1997, in the North Carolina Research
              Triangle.  With the acknowledgement and recognition of the RNA Society,
              researchers in North Carolina have formed a "chapter", the RNA Society of North
              Carolina, which is responsible for organizing and funding the Symposium on RNA
              Biology.    The objectives of this symposium are as follows:    1. Promote
              communication in this important research area of RNA structure/function
              relationships in a focused manner not obtainable at regular society, or other
              group meetings;    2. Provide an educational experience for postdoctoral
              fellows and graduate students in a setting conducive to open discussions with
              established investigators who have broad experience in the field of RNA
              interactions;    3. Stimulate discussion and the sharing of ideas and
              techniques by principals as well as by postdoctoral fellows and students; and  
               4. Bring researchers to a venue where three major universities, federal
              research institutions and laboratories, and many corporate research centers are
              located.  RNA research has spawned a dozen biotechnology companies in the US
              alone and has been funded extensively by several large, well-established
              corporations, including those in North Carolina's Research Triangle.    RNA
              synthesis, chemistry, structure and function are central to the viability of
              all biological systems.  Research in these areas has led to biotechnological
              applications of RNA as both target and reagent.  New and exciting RNA
              structures have been discovered that are both potential targets and tools, and
              are revealing interesting new functional modes of interaction with proteins. 
              This meeting will focus on this area and will serve  as a forum for sharing
              data and techniques.  ***
