Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical physics will deal with a series  of fundamental
              problems in field theory and superstring  theory.  Field theory, in particular
              Yang-Mills gauge  theory, describes the strong, weak and electromagnetic 
              forces in general very well.  Top quark physics is very  important since its
              discovery two years ago at Fermi  Laboratory.  We pursue in detail theories
              related to top  quark physics using resummation methods in quantum 
              chromodynamics.       Supergravity is the field theory which is the low- 
              energy limit of supersymmetry theory, and superstring theory  has emerged as
              the unique candidate for uniting gravity with  relativity and quantum physics. 
              Studies will be made of  nonperturbative and geometric aspects of superstring 
              theory, duality in string theory and self-dual Yang-Mills  field theories, as
              well as supergravity and path integrals  for these theories.
