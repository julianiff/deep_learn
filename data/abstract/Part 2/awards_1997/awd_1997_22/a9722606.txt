Abstract    :
                   Research in relativistic heavy ions will be carried out  making use of the
              Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at  Brookhaven National Laboratory
              (BNL).  The research will  include development of a specialized detector known
              as  PHOBOS for use at RHIC.  PHOBOS will provide a first look at  the behavior
              and decay of matter at the extreme energy  densities that will be created in
              gold-on-gold collisions  with energies of 100GeV/nucleon in the center-of-mass 
              system.  This work is aimed at characterizing the  hypothesized quark-gluon
              plasma which is created in such  energies collisions, and in which quarks and
              gluons are  thought to be deconfined, unlike the case in normal hadronic 
              matter.  In addition, research will be carried out at the  BNL Alternating
              Gradient Synchrotron facility.  This  experiment will probe the dynamics of
              hadron-hadron  interactions at lower energies than RHIC, where the details  of
              the interactions are better understood and where improved  understanding will
              permit needed extrapolations of the  behavior of ordinary hadronic matter of
              RHIC energies.       These data will extend our knowledge of matter to 
              energies and densities thought to have existed only in the  first microseconds
              of the early universe.  This topic is a  high priority within US nuclear
              science, as established by  the joint NSF/DOE Nuclear Science Advisory
              Committee in its  1996 Long Range Plan.  Education of students and postdocs is 
              a strong component of this experimental program.
