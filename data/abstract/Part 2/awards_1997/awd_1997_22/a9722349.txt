Abstract    :
              Lay Abstract    PI: Miller, Mark  Proposal Number: IBN-9722349    Many
              goal-oriented behaviors are said to be "motivated" as  their occurrence depends
              upon both extrinsic factors (such  as the presence of food) and the intrinsic
              state of the  organism (such as the level of hunger or satiety). This 
              investigation relates the activities of specific brain cells  and the
              connections between them to the generation of  complex motivated patterns of
              behavior. The project focuses  on the role of  chemical substances called
              neuropeptides,  which modulate the activity of these nervous system cells 
              during motivated behavior such as eating. The studies are  conducted as part of
              an undergraduate summer program at the  Institute of Neurobiology in San Juan,
              Puerto Rico so that  every step of the research program involves
              undergraduates.  Most organisms, including humans, exhibit a variety of 
              motivated behaviors. This project investigates the  fundamental principles
              underlying the brain mechanisms  controlling such behaviors. By coupling the
              research to the  undergraduate summer research program, the project provides 
              students with access to hands-on research opportunities and  experiences that
              were previously inaccessible to students at  the host institution.
