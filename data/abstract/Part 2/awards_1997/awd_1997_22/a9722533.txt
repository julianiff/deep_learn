The neutron and the proton are the two basic building blocks of
              matter.
Knowledge of the charge structure of the neutron is essential to
              understanding the structure of matter. This knowledge is needed for detailed
              microscopic calculations of electromagnetic nuclear structure, for testing
              evolving constituent quark models of particle structure, and for extraction of
              the strange quark content of the proton from parity-violating electron
              scattering experiments. Current knowledge of the neutron charge structure is
              insufficient to meet these needs. Jefferson Laboratory (JLab) Experiment 93-038
              addresses this fundamental question regarding the nature of the charge
              structure of the neutron: What is the spatial distribution of the constituent
              quarks within the neutron? In this experiment, longitudinally polarized
              electrons scatter quasielastically from a neutron in deuterium.  JLab E93-038
              will utilize a neutron polarimeter detector designed specifically for the
              measurement of the scattering asymmetry from the sideways polarization
              component of the neutron.  Another advantage of quasielastic scattering from
              deuterium is that the interpretation of the results is insensitive to
              theoretical models involving the structure of the deuteron. JLab E93-038 has
              the scientific potential for achieving smaller statistical and systematic
              uncertainties than other techniques at this time.
