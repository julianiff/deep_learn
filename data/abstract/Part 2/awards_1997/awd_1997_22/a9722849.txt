Abstract    :
              The Mathematical Sciences Research Institute will acquire two  computation
              servers, two file servers, two web servers, three  bootservers, five graphics
              workstations, and 45 commodity (PC)  workstations which will be dedicated to
              the support of research in the  mathematical sciences. The equipment will be
              used for our 1997-1999  programs in Stochastic Analysis, Harmonic Analysis,
              Model Theory of  Fields, Symbolic Computation, Foundations of Computational 
              Mathematics, and Random Matrix Models. we will move to a network model  with
              commodity workstations in each office and higher end workstations  in public
              laboratories, all providing access to specialized servers  elsewhere on the
              network.
