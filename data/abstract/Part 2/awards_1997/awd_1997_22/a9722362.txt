Abstract    :
                   Research in quantum gravity, a branch of theoretical  physics, will focus
              on the evaporation of black holes, the  microscopic structure of space and
              time, and the big bang.  The importance of quantum gravity research, in which
              one  tries to construct a theory of the force of gravity which is  compatible
              both with relativity and with quantum mechanics,  is that it opens a window to
              the most fundamental levels of  physical reality.  If there is ever to be a
              revolution  comparable to the discoveries of relativity and quantum  mechanics,
              the area of quantum gravity is where it may well  happen.       Work in physics
              education will concern introductory  mechanics and Einstein's relativity.  Dorm
              room experiments  for mechanics will be designed using high quality but 
              unintimidating equipment such as Mattel's `micro Hot Wheels'  toy cars.  This
              informal and interactive approach is  essential to students' becoming
              comfortable with physics and  building physics intuition.  Regarding
              relativity, a course  for non-physicists will be introduced.  Because
              Einstein's  `theory of relativity' is actually a well established  experimental
              fact, it is important that any student have the  opportunity to share this new
              understanding of space and  time.
