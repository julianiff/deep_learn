Abstract    :
                   The PI's main research interests lie at the (less and  less clearly
              defined) border between mathematics and  theoretical physics.  Physics provides
              an ever-evolving  source of inspiration and intuition for the formulation of 
              mathematical problems.  The two subjects currently pursued  are both inspired
              by surface physics, namely the description  of the behavior of two-dimensional
              objects, such as  membranes, or interfaces between different media, with 
              possible applications to biology (membrane in a solvent,  protein folding). 
              Remarkably, new mathematical tools needed  to develop our understanding of
              surface physics have emerged  in the very different context of string theory,
              which aims  at a unified description of the matter and space  interactions in
              the universe.  Surfaces emerge in this  framework as the trajectories of
              loop-like particles  (strings).  The research is principally concerned with 
              (1)  The physical and mathematical aspects of discrete two-  dimensional
              quantum gravity, a simple model of string  theory, in which discretized
              surfaces resembling fishing  nets are generated by a powerful tool: the random
              matrix  models and (2) The various combinatorial and algebraic  problems linked
              to the concept of folding in surface and  polymer physics.  In particular, the
              PI will investigate  possible crumpling or folding transitions of surfaces when
               physical parameters such as temperature or bending rigidity  are varied.
