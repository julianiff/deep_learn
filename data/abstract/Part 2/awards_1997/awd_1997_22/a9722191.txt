Abstract    :
              9722191  Williams  Breeding programs have typically neglected, due to its
              inaccessibility, modification of the root system. No direct selection is
              possible for the improvement of, e.g., root structure or architecture.
              Selection schemes are indirect. Arabidopsis is an ideal model in which to
              identify the genes controlling root architecture. To identify roots with
              abnormal rates of lateral root formation, M2 mutagenized seeds will be
              screened. Only those plants in which the growth rate and morphology of the
              primary root is not altered will be pursued. An extensive genetic analysis of
              the remaining mutants will be carried out, including backcrosses into the wild
              type, and construction of double mutant combinations. Selected loci will be
              cloned.   In addition, conserved regions of select genes will be used for the
              amplification of a lateral root cDNA library. The expression pattern of the
              root-specific genes and the function of the encoded gene products will be
              ascertained.  The proposed work will be conducted primarily by undergraduate
              students, in summer programs and in required senior research projects. A better
              understanding of the plasticity of lateral root formation and of genes involved
              in lateral root formation will result from this project.
