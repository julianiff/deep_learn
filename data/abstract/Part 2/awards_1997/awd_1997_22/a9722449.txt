Abstract    :
              9722449  Magasanik    This U.S.-Mexico award will support a research workshop on
               nitrogen metabolism in Ascomycetes, to be held in San Jose  Vistahermosa,
              Mexico.  Organizers are Prof. Boris Magasanik  of MIT and Prof. Alicia
              Gonzalez, from the Cellular  Physiology Institute of the Universidad Nacional
              Autonoma de  Mexico (UNAM).  The purpose of the workshop is to bring  together
              scientists from the United States, Europe,  Australia, and Mexico  to discuss
              the diverse mechanisms  whereby information on nitrogen abundance or lack
              thereof in  the growth medium, leads to the expression of genes involved  in
              nitrogen metabolism.    The meeting will consist of one hour talks by each of
              the  invited participants followed by round table discussions of  the topics
              under discussion, with emphasis on the particular  environments of the
              different organisms under study, their  evolution, and significance of results
              for higher plants and  animals. Abstracts of talks will be made available to
              all  participants as well as to all interested scientists.  * * *
