Abstract    :
              9722591  McNabb    This U.S.-Brazil award will support a research collaboration 
              between Drs. Ken McNabb and Graeme Lockaby of Auburn  University to work with
              Dr. Jose Leonardo de Moraes  Goncalves at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil
              on a  study of soil organic matter fluxes in Amazonian forests:  natural vs.
              intensively managed systems.    The question of concern to these researchers is
              whether  intensive management activities like mechanical harvesting  and site
              preparation, fertilization, mechanical and chemical  weed control, and the use
              of single species/clones  negatively impact long term site productivity.  The 
              researchers will look at soil organic matter (SOM) fluxes as  indicators of
              long term sustainability and will make a  comparison of soil carbon inputs,
              soil carbon fractions, and  the physical and chemical differences between
              intensively  managed plantations and immediately adjacent undisturbed  natural
              forest.  It is their hypothesis that there will be  quantitative and
              qualitative differences in soil carbon  fluxes between the two systems, and the
              researchers will  identify and quantify these differences.    ***
