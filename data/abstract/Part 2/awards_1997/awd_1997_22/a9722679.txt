              9722679  Pullin    This proposal requests funding for travel and related 
              expenses  for six US junior researcherq and graduate  students  to participate
              in a workshop on quantum  gravity in the Southern Cone..  Organizers for the 
              workshop, to take place in Bariloche, Argentina,  January 1998,  are Dr. Jorge
              Pullin, Pennsylvania State  University, and Drs. Mario Castagnino, University
              of  Buenos Aires,  and Carmen Nunez, Institute of Astronomy  and Space Physics
              .  The organizing committee also  includes members from groups in Bariloche, 
              Uruguay,  and Chile.  The plenary speakers and lecturers will  consist of
              scientists from several US universities, as  well as representatives from
              London, France, Brussels,  Spain, and other Latin American countries.    
              Participation in this activity will give the young  scientists an opportunity
              to interact with senior  experts in the field, and an international experience 
              invaluable for  their professional development.  ***
