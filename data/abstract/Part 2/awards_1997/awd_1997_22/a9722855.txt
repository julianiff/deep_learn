Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at Northwestern University will  purchase computer
              equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research in mathematics.
              The equipment will be used  for three large research projects in mathematics,
              in particular in low dimensional dynamics and related areas; large scale
              symbolic manipulation computer calculations in various areas of mathematics as
              they relate to algebraic topology; and research in nonlinear evolution
              equations.
