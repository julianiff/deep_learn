Abstract    :
              IBN-9722932  PI:  Grodzicker  The fruitfly, Drosophila, has provided an
              extremely useful model system to study neurobiology.  This meeting on the
              Neurobiology of Drosophila, every two years, focuses on the advances made as
              the combined power of genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology
              and behavioral analysis are brought to bear on fundamental problems of
              neurobiology.  This particular conference includes issues of neural
              development, neurotransmitters and receptors, ion channels, sensory systems and
              complex behavior.  The conference is small with a format offering talks and
              posters but no overlapping sessions, to maximize the opportunities for
              discussion.  The conference has an established history of highlighting the work
              of younger investigators and women.  The conference will have an impact on all
              of neuroscience by addressing fundamental questions and promoting new
              collaborations.
