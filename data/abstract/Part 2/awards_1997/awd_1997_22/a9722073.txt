Abstract    :
                   Research will be done at the interface of theoretical  nuclear and
              elementary particle physics using the analytical  and numerical techniques
              known as `lattice QCD` to  investigate a set of topics on computers at major 
              supercomputer centers.  QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics) is the  theory which
              describes the strong nuclear force.  Lattice  techniques make impossible
              calculations possible by  replacing the continuum of spacetime by a discrete
              lattice  of points.  The first of the topics to be pursued will be  the
              interaction between light and the `pion` particles found  in collisions of
              nucleons.  The second project will be an  updated and more precise computer
              study of neutron and  proton electromagnetic structure.  The third project will
              be  a detailed investigation of a set of numerical techniques  which deal with
              so-called `disconnected diagrams` in lattice  QCD.       QCD is part of our
              theory of the four fundamental  forces of nature.  The studies to be carried
              out here will  test whether the implications of QCD can be reliably  determined
              using lattice techniques.
