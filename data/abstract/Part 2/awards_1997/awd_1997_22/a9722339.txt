Abstract    :
               We  propose to develop robust software and algorithms for very  high-quality 
              DNA  sequence  assembly  and  multiple   sequence  alignment. The specific
              problems we target are      shotgun  sequence  assembly  in the  presence  of 
              sequencing     error, repetitive elements, and chimeric clones, and      
              multiple  sequence alignment under the maximum-trace  scoring     function.
