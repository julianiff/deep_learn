Abstract    :
              9722128  Bodenschatz  In order to measure important parameters of fully
              developed  turbulent flow, a novel particle tracking system will be  developed
              and used.  This system is based on the technology  developed for the analysis
              of high energy particle collision  data.  This research will contribute
              significantly to our  understanding of turbulence, and will provide data for 
              comparison with theoretical predictions.  This grant is supported jointly be
              the Division of Physics,  the Division of Materials Research, and the Office of
               Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) of the Mathematical and  Physical Sciences
              Directorate (MPS).  ***
