Abstract    :
              This three-year grant will support a faculty member, two  graduate students, an
              undergraduate student, and some staff  and technician support at the dedicated
              Wisconsin Van de  Graaff facility to perform a variety of measurements 
              investigating the nature of the nuclear force in light  nuclear systems.  Using
              polarized ion sources and cryogenic  polarized targets radiative capture of
              protons with  deuterons will investigate the role of tensor forces.  The 
              scattering of deuterons from 3He will investigate possible  violation of
              time-reversal invariance in the strong  interaction.  Other experiments will
              explore the effects of  three-body forces.  Radioactive oxygen beams will be 
              developed for use in important nuclear astrophysics cross-  section
              measurements; these radioactive nuclei play an  important role in the CNO
              cycle.  A very important part of  the Wisconsin program is the in-depth
              education of  undergraduate and graduate students.
