Abstract    :
              Ludden  9722917  The Eleventh International Congress on Nitrogen Fixation will
              be held in Paris, France, July 20-25, 1997. Nitrogen fixation is one of the
              most important subject areas relating to the support of life on earth and
              encompasses concerns related to natural resource conservation, particularly
              fossil fuels, plant-microbe signaling and interaction, regulatory mechanisms,
              nutrition, food production, etc. This congress is of great importance for this
              scientific field. Scientists from over 30 different countries are expected to
              attend. The topics to be discussed will cover virtually all aspects of
              biological and non-biological nitrogen fixation and will include the following
              major topics:  1) chemistry and biochemistry of nitrogen fixation;  2) genetics
              and regulation of nitrogen fixation and assimilation; 3) rhizobial and
              actinorhizal symbiosis;  4) environmental and physiological factors controlling
              nitrogen fixation;  5) nitrogen fixation by bacteria in association with
              grasses;  6)  nitrogen fixation in forests;  7)  sustainable agriculture and
              nitrogen fixation;  8)  genetics of legumes and symbiotic organisms;  9) 
              taxonomy and phylogeny of diazotrophs;  10)  nitrogen fixation by
              photosynthetic bacteria and cyanobacteria;  11)  carbon metabolism of
              nitrogen-fixing organisms;  and 12)  nitrogen fixation and environmental
              stresses.    This grant will be used to provide travel funds for U.S. graduate
              students, postdoctoral fellows, and other more junior scientists.   All
              recipients will present their work at the meeting.
