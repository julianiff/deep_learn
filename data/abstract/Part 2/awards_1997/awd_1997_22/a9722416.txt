Abstract    :
              Lay Abstract    PI: Spivak, Marla  Proposal Number: IBN-9722416    This project
              develops a coordinated educational and research  program that offers
              undergraduate students a change to  become actively involved in their own
              scientific  development. The project is build around research designed  to
              understand the behavior and neural basis of hygienic  behavior in honey bees.
              Hygienic behavior is a mechanism is  a defense against a parasitic mite and a
              mechanism of  disease resistance in which bees identify and remove  parasitized
              and diseased brood from the hive. This project  examines the behavior expressed
              by bees, identifies the  sensory cues they use to trigger the behavior, and 
              investigates the nervous system mechanisms that control its  expression.
              Undergraduate students participate in research  projects ranging from practical
              bee breeding to behavioral  and neurobiological experiments in the laboratory. 
              Understanding the factors that regulate hygienic behavior in  honey bees, vital
              pollinators in may parts of the world  including agricultural areas, is
              critical as beekeepers  search for bees with natural defenses against diseases
              and  mites with the goal of reducing antibiotic and pesticide  application.
