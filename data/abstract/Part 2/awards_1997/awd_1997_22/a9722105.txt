Abstract    :
              9722105  Mitchell    This U.S.-Brazil Award will support Dr. Gary E. Mitchell of
               North Carolina State University to work with Dr. Mahir  Hussein of the
              Universidade de Sao Paulo in Brazil, on tests  of fundamental symmetries in the
              compound nucleus.    The PIs are interested in the manifestation of symmetry in
               the nucleus and how it is affected by a many body system.  The focus will be
              on the breaking of one approximate  symmetry (isospin) and one fundamental
              symmetry (parity) in  the nucleus.  The statistical distributions that 
              characterize the fluctuation properties of the complex  nuclear system reflect
              the underlying symmetries.  One can  then study the statistical distributions
              of eigenvalues and  of transition strengths to search for the effects of 
              symmetries, and even detect hidden symmetries.      Mitchell has been an active
              participant in the measurements  on parity violation and a leader in the
              measurements on  isospin mixing.  Hussein is a leader in the application of 
              random matrix theory to nuclear physics and to symmetry  breaking in the
              nucleus.    ***
