Abstract    :
              This 3 1/2 year grant will support two faculty, two  postdoctorals, three
              graduate and three undergraduate  students to participate in experiments at
              CERN, in  Switzerland, and at the AGS proton accelerator at Brookhaven 
              National Laboratory.  The CERN experiment studies in a new  unique way the--as
              yet not understood--fundamental CP  (particle-antiparticle exchange, space
              inversion) symmetry  violation, by producing beams of neutral kaons and anti- 
              kaons by annihilation of stopped antiprotons using LEAR (Low  Energy Antiproton
              Ring).  The symmetry violation manifests  itself in asymmetries in the kaon
              decay rates.  The data  taking phase was completed recently and the data
              analysis  will require tow years of effort.  Part of this grant is  provided
              through the MPS/Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities equipment initiative,
              allowing acquisition of  needed computer workstations and tape drives for this 
              analysis effort.  At the AGS a high precision measurement of  the anomalous
              magnetic moment (g-2) of the muon will be  performed using a 600 ton
              superconducting magnetic storage  ring.  Under construction since 1988, this
              experiment begins  data taking this year.  The improved precision (factor 20 to
               0.35 ppm) of this measurement will provide information  regarding the
              fundamental theory of the electro-weak  interaction, specifically with regard
              to supersymmetry and  possible muon or W-boson substructure. These measurements
               complement those obtained from very high-energy  accelerators, such as at
              Fermilab and the Large Hadron  Collider, now under construction at CERN.
