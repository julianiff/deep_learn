Abstract    :
                      1            9722771  Cooper  This project entitled Charge Transfer and
              Scattering Dynamics  in  Kiloelectron Volt and Hyperthermal Energy Ion-Surface 
              Collisions  emphasizes  a coupling of experiments with extensive modeling  of 
              charge  transfer and scattering mechanisms.  It  focuses  on  two  major 
              topics.  The first is multi-state charge transfer dynamics  in  hyperthermal 
              ion-surface collisions  where  the  effects  of  surface and atom electronic
              structure on charge transfer dynamics  is  modeled  with a multi-state charge
              transfer code that  solves  the time-dependent Schrodinger equation for several
              atomic states  interacting simultaneously with the surface.  The second topic
              is  charge  transfer,  trapping  and scattering  dynamics  in  atomic  oxygen 
              ion collisions with surfaces, a system that has  received  little attention due
              to very challenging experimental issues.  %%%  All  of the experiments explore
              ion-surface interactions that are  fundamentally important to fabrication and
              processing of advanced  materials in areas such as plasma and ion beam thin
              film  growth,  and the plasma processing of semiconductor materials for
              devices.  ***
