Abstract    :
              9722818  Feigenson  A goal of this work is to find the solubility limit of
              cholesterol in model and real biomembranes, above which cholesterol
              precipitates from the bilayer as a crystal.  This project has four main
              components: (I) defined mixtures of cholesterol and phospholipids are used as
              models for biomembranes; (ii) novel methods, together with X-ray diffraction
              experiments, are developed that are sensitive to the formation of coexisting
              phases; (iii) Monte Carlo computer simulations are used in order to find the
              cholesterol and phospholipid interaction energy over the entire range of
              compositions; (iv) crystalline cholesterol monohydrate formation is probed in
              cultured mammalian cells.  These experiments will enable construction of
              3-component phase diagrams that describe the mixing of cholesterol with two
              different phospholipids.  The theoretical part of this project develops a model
              to describe the microscopic interaction energy between cholesterol and its
              neighboring lipids.  Guided by these model system studies, X-ray diffraction
              and electron and optical microscopy of cells in culture will determine
              cholesterol solubility limits in real biomembranes.    The overall objective of
              this project is to define and measure excessive cholesterol content, for a
              given membrane.  These basic studies will clarify mechanisms of cholesterol
              accumulation within cells and cellular signals for its uptake.  ***
