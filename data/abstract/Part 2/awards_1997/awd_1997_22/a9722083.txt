Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical physics of elementary particles  and strings will
              include:  Precision calculations of the  quantum corrections to the Standard
              Model of elementary  interactions. This kind of calculations has been crucial, 
              already, to show that the Standard Model is the most  successful theory of
              elementary interactions ever.  In the  present and future, it shall allow us to
              compare this theory  with experiment, with accuracy sufficient to open a window
               on possible new physics.  ii) Non-perturbative calculations  in string theory.
               Strings are the only reliable theory of  (perturbative) quantum gravity
              available today.  Some  calculations can be performed using to the fullest
              extent  special symmetries (extended supersymmetry, duality etc.).  These
              calculations are crucial in trying to understand the  deepest aspect of string
              theory, as, for instance, to which  degree it is unique.  They also provide a
              powerful technique  for understanding the physics of strongly interacting 
              quantum fields.
