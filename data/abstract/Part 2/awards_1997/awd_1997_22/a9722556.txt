Abstract    :
              This three-year grant will support the research group of two  faculty who are
              investigating the nucleon-nucleon  interaction using polarized proton beams and
              an internal  polarized hydrogen target at the Indiana University  Cyclotron
              Facility Cooler storage ring.  The experiment  would illuminate the role of
              heavy meson exchange in the  short range nucleon-nucleon interaction by
              measuring the  spin correlations in neutral pion production near threshold  in
              p+p reactions.  Another experiment will measure spin  correlations for the p+d
              breakup reaction in the medium  energy regime, which would elucidate the role
              of three-body  forces.  Polarized target development would continue;  this 
              work may lead to significant improvements in the luminosity  of polarized gas
              targets used in storage rings.  The nature  of the weak interaction in nuclei
              will be studied with a  measurement of the spatial asymmetry in the decay of
              laser  trapped, polarized 38K.  This experiment is sensitive to the  existence
              of heavy right-handed gauge bosons, and also to  more exotic particles such as
              leptoquarks.  The Madison  group provides an important role in the education
              and  training of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.
