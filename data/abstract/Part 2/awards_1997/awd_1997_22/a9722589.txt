Abstract    :
              INT 9722589  Baker    This U.S.-Hungary research project between R. Terry K.
              Baker of Northeastern University, Boston, and Zoltan Paal of the Institute of
              Isotopes, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, will examine deactivation
              phenomena associated with supported metal catalyst systems.  Specifically, the
              collaborative work will feature the formation of carbonaceous deposits produced
              on supported platinum particles from interaction with selected probe molecules.
               The intent is to develop a metal-supported system that will enable control of
              the amount and form of carbon deposit accumulation on platinum surfaces when
              heated in a carbon-containing gas environment.  If successful, this could
              improve our ability to: 1) manipulate the size, morphology and crystallographic
              features of platinum particles and 2) identify the optimum amount of additives
              or impurities required for tailoring the catalytic properties of the system.   
              This engineering project in chemical reaction processes fulfills the program
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
              United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.  ??
