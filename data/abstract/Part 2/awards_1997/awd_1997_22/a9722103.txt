Abstract    :
                9722103  Goulden                                    This is a 12-month award
              proposed by Dr. Clyde Goulden,  Academy of Natural Science of Philadelphia. 
              This proposal  requests funds for purchasing a wireless communication 
              (telephone) system for NSF supported biodiversity field  studies in Mongolia. 
              Each summer a group of twenty research  scientists and students from the United
              States, Mongolia,  Russia and Japan converge on Lake Hovsgol in northern 
              Mongolia to study the biology and ecology of the lake and to  develop this area
              for use as an international  long-term  ecological research site.  This is an
              outgrowth of  NSF  supported project to study the systematic and ecology of 
              Lake Hovsgol.   Mongolia is a vast country without telephone  and communication
              infrastructure.  There is an urgent need  for a wireless communication system
              for the research group  at Hovsgol Lake.   This project is also an important
              trial  for examining the suitability of wireless communication for  use in
              remote field studies in  regions with little or no  communication
              infrastructure.  The results can be useful for  improving communication in many
              similar field projects  operating in remote regions of the world.
