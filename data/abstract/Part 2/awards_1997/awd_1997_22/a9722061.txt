Abstract    :
              9722061  Siggia     This award is to provide partial support for a Workshop on
              Biophysics of the Cell, to be   held August 11 - September 5, 1997, at the
              Aspen Center for Physics, Aspen, Colorado.    The Workshop will bring together
              and foster interactions among cell biologists,   biophysicists, and physicists
              (theoretical physicists working in areas of soft condensed   matter and
              dynamical systems).  ***
