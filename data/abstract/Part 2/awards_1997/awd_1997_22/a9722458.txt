Abstract    :
              9722458  Romsted    This award will support Dr. Laurence S. Romsted of Rutgers 
              University and Dr. Clifford A. Bunton of The University of  California, Santa
              Barbara to go to Brazil to work with Dr.  Iolanda Cuccovia at Universidade de
              Sao Paulo and Dr. Dino  Zanette at Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina on
              the  study of properties of submicroscopic interfaces.    This research will
              lead to better understanding of the  interfacial forces which control chemical
              reactivity and  aggregate stability in complex multicomponent association 
              colloids.  Two research groups from the U.S. will join three  groups from
              Brazil, along with two sets of graduate students  from both sides to pursue
              this research problem.  Many  industries depend upon the properties of
              organized systems  and their interfaces including: cleaning, agricultural 
              products, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, enhanced oil recovery,  dyes and dyeing,
              solar energy storage, and environmental  clean-up.      ***
