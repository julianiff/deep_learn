Abstract    :
              9722514  Ashtekar    This U.S.-Mexico award will support a research
              collaboration  between Prof. Abhay Ashtekar, Prof. Jorge Pullin, and Prof. 
              Pablo Laguna of Penn State University and a group of  researchers at four
              Mexican institutions, headed by Prof.  Michael Ryan of the Instituto de
              Ciencias Nucleares (ICN) of  the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico
              (UNAM).  Other  Mexican institutions involved in the research collaboration 
              are the Instituto de Fisica of the Universidad de  Guanajuato, the Centro de
              Investigaciones y de Estudios  Avanzados (CINVESTAV), and the Universidad
              Autonoma  Metropolitana.  The researchers propose to cover a broad  range of
              topics, among them: black hole evolution and  structure, numerical relativity,
              inhomogeneous cosmological  models, canonical gravity, new variables, loops,
              and  supergravity.    The project will serve to consolidate several  separate 
              collaborations between top researchers in both countries. It  has the potential
              to increase our understanding of black  holes, both their formation and their
              dynamics, as well as  making important contributions in numerical relativity
              and  the numerical analysis of black hole collisions.  ***
