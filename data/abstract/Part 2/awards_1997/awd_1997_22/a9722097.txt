Abstract    :
                   A number of theoretical investigations in theoretical  elementary particle
              physics will be carried out, focusing  primarily on the physics of the strongly
              interacting  particles as described by the quantum chromodynamic theory  which
              is widely accepted as the correct fundamental  description of the nuclear
              force.  The methods used will  involve extensive computations on massively
              parallel  dedicated computers.  An important specific aim of the  research is
              an accurate (few percent) calculation from the  fundamental theory of the
              electromagnetic fine structure of  the spectrum of strongly interacting
              particles.  This will  be one of the first precise tests of quantum
              chromodynamics,  which up to now has only been tested at best at the 5-10% 
              level.  In addition, this research program is the first to  allow an accurate
              determination of the masses of the quarks,  the fundamental building blocks of
              all known strongly  interacting particles.
