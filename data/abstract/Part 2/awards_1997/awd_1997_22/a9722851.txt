Abstract    :
              9722851  Levi  A workshop on the topic of functional meso-optics is proposed.
              The workshop will be held Jan. 25-28, 1997 at Crested Butte, CO. The purpose of
              this workshop is to bring together members of the scientific and engineering
              community to discuss and help define this new subject area. This will involve
              developing an understanding and synergy between members of the system, device,
              and physics community. Future functional meso-optic devices and circuits will
              likely exploit very small high-Q optical resonators and optically non-linear
              materials. The high-Q resonators are needed to enhance local electric-fields,
              allowing construction of very small, very low-loss optical devices. Functional
              devices require active regions which cause switching of optical power from one
              state to another. This will likely involve the use of an optical non-linear
              medium to either spatially or spectrally switch a local state. The interplay
              between non-linear effects and high-Q resonators is a potentially fertile area
              for both physics and device research. There are also significant opportunities
              for developing advanced systems concepts using new functional meso-optical
              components which will emerge from this overall effort.  Funds from both NSF and
              AFOSR will be used to support the workshop.  The NSF support will stress
              students and education.
