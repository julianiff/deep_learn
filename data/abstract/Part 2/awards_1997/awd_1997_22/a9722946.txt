Abstract    :
                 Victoria Booth  Layman's abstract for proposal titled "A dendritic origin of 
              bistability of motoneuron firing patterns" (proposal #: IBN-  9722946)    In
              response to stimuli from the rest of the nervous system,  neurons in the spinal
              cord, called motoneurons, generate an  electrical signal called an action
              potential that is  transmitted to muscle fibers and induces contraction.  In 
              this way, the pattern of action potential firing by  motoneurons regulates
              muscle movement.  In the presence of  the naturally-occuring neurotransmitter
              serotonin,  experimentalists have observed motoneurons firing complex  patterns
              of action potentials that are believed to affect  muscle activity.  The cell
              mechanisms within motoneurons  responsible for the generation of action
              potentials are  sufficiently well known to allow the development of 
              mathematical models that replicate motoneuron behavior.  The  goal of this
              proposal is to investigate the cell mechanisms  underlying the generation of
              the serotonin-induced complex  firing behaviors by studying mathematical models
              of  motoneurons.  Of particular interest is the suggestion that  the complex
              behaviors are a result of the interaction of  mechanisms located in different
              segments of the neuron,  where one segment was previously thought to be
              uninvolved in  action potential generation.
