Abstract    :
              IBN:  9722704  PI:  BOK  Vision is a topic of major interest in neuroscience. 
              The FASEB Summer Conference on the Biology & Chemistry of vision has become a
              regular event every two years, and this year the emphasis is on the structure,
              function and development of photoreceptors and the pigment epithelium of the
              retina.  This emphasis also brings in discussions of the latest technologies
              that have led to novel advances in the field.  A variety of speakers will cover
              this range of topics, and the conference remains small enough to promote
              vigorous exchanges of ideas in informal as well as formal settings.  The NSF
              partial support will assist younger investigators from diverse backgrounds to
              participate in this conference.  This conference will have an impact across
              many areas of visual neuroscience, on the careers of young investigators by
              allowing them a chance to interact readily with highly regarded senior
              investigators, and will extend to interactions with physician/scientists by
              enhancing their understanding of basic mechanisms that underlie retinal
              disease.
