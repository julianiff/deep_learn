Abstract    :
              9722486  Kra    This Americas Program award will fund an iberoamerican  congress
              on geometry, to be held in Cruz del Sur, Chile,  January 7-11. 1998. 
              Organizers are Dr. Irwin Kra, State  University of New York at Stony Brook, and
              Dr. Rubi  Rodriguez, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.  The  congress
              will promote international scientific cooperation,  by bringing together active
              researchers from US, Chile.  Mexico and Spain, and other European countries. 
              The central  theme of the conference will be the geometry of Riemann  surfaces,
              an active research area in many countries around  the world.  Other themes will
              be Teichmuller theory and  Klein surfaces.    One of the objectives of the
              conference is to create the  opportunity for young researchers in these and
              other groups  to establish strong international ties.  This meeting  will 
              foster this effort by bringing together for the first time  the principal
              leaders in the field.  ***
