Abstract    :
              Westpheling  9722960  The primary long-term objective of this study is to
              understand the regulatory interconnection between carbon source catabolite
              repression, activation of antibiotic biosynthesis and morphological development
              in the Streptomyces bacteria.  The general approach of this project has been to
              use catabolite controlled genes involved in complex carbohydrate utilization as
              tools to probe the connection between carbon utilization and morphogenesis. 
              Using this approach, a new class of mutants was identified that are at once
              defective in catabolite control and morphogenesis, and also overproduce
              antibiotics.  The most pleiotropic of the known morphological mutants of
              Streptomyces, bldB, was shown during the course of previous work to be
              pleiotropically defective in the regulation of carbon utilization.  The bldB
              gene product is required for catabolite repression, the initiation of
              morphogenesis and antibiotic biosynthesis in S. coelicolor, and the study of
              how this gene functions in the interconnection of these processes is a major
              focus of the current project.  To facilitate the isolation, cloning, and
              characterization of new mutants, transposon mutagenesis and generalized
              transduction methods in S. venezuelae are being developed to be used in
              combination with S. coelicolor for genetic analysis.
