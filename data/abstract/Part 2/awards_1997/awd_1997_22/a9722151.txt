Abstract    :
              Lynch  9722151    Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for plant growth; 
              however, in many soils, phosphorus is an immobile resource  which makes
              phosphorus acquisition an obstacle for plants.  In the United States,
              phosphorus overfertilazation in  agricultural has added to the pollution of the
              Chesapeake  Bay, the Florida Everglades, and other major watersheds.  To 
              increase the availability of phosphorus in naturally  occurring soils and to
              decrease the amount of fertilizer  used in agricultural practices, it is
              important to study how  plant roots extract phosphorus from the soil.  Plant
              root  hairs are subcellular extensions from the root epidermis  that are
              hypothetically important in the acquisition of  immobile resources such as
              phosphorus.  The PI's previous  work with Arabidopsis thatliana has shown that
              root hair  length, growth rate, and density is highly regulated by  phosphorus
              availability.  The goal of the PI's research is  to determine the importance of
              root hairs in overall plant  phosphorus nutrition, characterize the response of
              increased  root hair density with decreased phosphorus availability,  and
              dissect the cellular mechanism of root hair growth in  response to exotenous
              phosphorus nutrition.  Quantitative  ratio fluorescence microscopy and root
              hair mutant plants  will be used to study the response of root hairs to 
              phosphorus availability.
