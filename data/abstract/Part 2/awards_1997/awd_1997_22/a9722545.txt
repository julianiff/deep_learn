Abstract    :
              9722545  Sohn    This award supports a two-year collaborative research  project
              between Dr. Andrew Sohn of the New Jersey Institute  of Technology and Dr.
              Dongseung Kim of Korea University in  Seoul, Korea on "Modeling and Analyzing
              Communication  Behavior of Parallel Programs on Distributed-Memory 
              Multiprocessors."  The objective of the project are to 1)  model the
              capabilities of hardware and software for  overlapping communication with
              computation, and 2) compare  the overlapping capabilities of distributed-memory
               multiprocessors on selected benchmark problems.    Distributed-memory
              multiprocessors are known to have the  architecture needed for increasing the
              machine's capability  by simply adding more processor to the system. 
              Programming  distributed-memory machines, however, is often difficult due  to
              many practical issues including algorithm design, data  distribution, and
              workload distribution.  When a large  number of processors work together to
              solve a single  problem, communication between processors becomes key to 
              determining the performance of large scale distributed  memory machines.  This
              project will combine the expertise  and facilities of the U.S. and Korea
              research groups in  addressing this important problem in computer science.  ***
