Abstract    :
              The study of nonlinear dynamics and chaos has had  significant applications to a
              large variety of disciplines  in science and engineering.  The research
              component of this  proposal focuses on one problem: nonlinear digital 
              communication with chaos, which is of fundamental importance  in science, and
              has significant applications to digital  communication that plays an extremely
              important role in a  modern economy and in national security.  Specifically, we
               plan to investigate the fundamental theory of utilizing  chaos to transmit
              digital information for communication and  to develop practical algorithms for
              designing chaotic  information sources.  The potential advantages of nonlinear 
              digital communication devices include greater efficiency,  light weight,
              compactness, greater information-bearing  capacity, greater number of
              communication channels, low-cost  manufacturing, low probability of
              interception and  detection.  The education component emphasizes on vigorous 
              and innovative methods of undergraduate and graduate  teaching, and solid
              training of graduate students on  research.  This NSF Career Award, which is
              supported by the Division of  Physics and the Experimental Program to Simulate
              Competitive  Research (EPSCoR) Program in Kansas, will provide a  supporting
              base for initiating an important new area in  frontier interdisciplinary
              science.  The PI's long-term  career goal is to establish a strong research and
              education  program on nonlinear science at the University of Kansas.
