Abstract    :
              INT 9722935  Meisel      This U.S.-Slovak research project between Mark Meisel
              of the University of Florida, Gainesville, and Alexander Feher of the Safarik
              University, Kosice, will feature the investigation of the thermodynamic and
              magnetic properties of novel low dimensional inorganic magnets.  The
              researchers intend to build upon their initial theoretical and experimental
              evidence that points to a new class of magnetic excitations in a highly
              anisotropic linear chain antiferromagnetic material.  Neutron scattering
              experiments are planned to confirm these findings as well as synthesis and
              characterization of powder and single crystals samples of the new low
              dimensional magnets.  Results are expected to contribute to our understanding
              of the properties of several low dimensional magnetic systems, specifically
              highlighting the pairing mechanisms observed in exotic superconductors (e.g.,
              heavy-fermion and high-Tc cuprate superconductors.)    This project in
              condensed matter physics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
              knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Central Europe
              to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong
              mutual interest and competence.       ??
