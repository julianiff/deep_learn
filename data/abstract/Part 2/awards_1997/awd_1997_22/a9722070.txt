Abstract    :
              9722070  Fink  The 1997 FASEB Summer Research Conference on Amyloid and  Protein
              Assembly Processes will be held at Copper Mountain, Colorado from July 13-18,
              1997. This conference should provide an increased awareness of protein
              deposition as a process that is not only biologically relevant but also
              exhibits significant molecular structure and specificity. The focus is on
              protein aggregation and other manifestations of protein-protein interactions,
              e.g., domain swapping. A main thrust of the conference is on folding and
              aggregation of polypeptide backbones using state of the art methodology. The
              conference will be attended by a maximum of 160 participants.  The topics are
              mainly fundamental in nature.    This meeting will bring together biologists
              familiar with the biology of  protein aggregation and assembly  processes in
              order to understand the molecular biology and biophysical basis of these
              phenomena. The format of the FASEB Summer Research Conferences is ideal for
              stimulating cross-fertilization in developing areas of research.
