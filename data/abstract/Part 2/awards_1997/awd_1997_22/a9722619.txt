Abstract    :
              9722619  Haus    This U.S.-Mexico award will support collaborative research 
              between Prof. Joseph Haus of Rensselaer Polytechnic  Institute and Prof. Javier
              Sanchez Mondragon of the  Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica, Optica y
              Electronica  (INAOE) in Puebla, Mexico.  The researchers propose to  complement
              experimental and theoretical investigations on  birefringent fiber
              interferometers for sensor applications  and applications of linear and
              nonlinear phenomena to  optical fibers.    Advances in the fiber development
              for sensors,  communications and optical information processing are giving 
              rise to more practical applications of nonlinear phenomena  to new devices,
              useful in processing information.  For this  research the INAOE will contribute
              experimental optical  facilities and theoretical support while the U.S. side
              will  contribute its expertise in ultra-short pulse propagation in  fibers and
              mode-locked fiber laser designs.  ***
