Abstract    :
              9722735  Faaborg    This Americas Program award will fund a 3-year cooperative 
              research project between Dr. John Faaborg, University of  Missouri, Columbia,
              and Dr. Tjitte de Vries, Pontificia  Universidad Catolica del Ecuador.  They
              will conduct  population studies on genetics and ecology on cooperative 
              polyandry in Galapagos hawks.  Cooperative polyandry, where  each female has
              several mates, but each male has only one,  is a useful system for studying the
              evolution of sociality  in vertebrates, and evaluating the conflict of
              interests  between the sexes.  "Cooperative" polyandry of this type is  rare,
              having been described in only seven species besides  Galapagos hawks.  In order
              to understand the evolution of  this form of cooperative breeding, there is
              need to know the  degree of relatedness of individuals breeding in groups, the 
              actual patterns of parentage among polyandrous males, and  the lifetime
              reproductive success of males and females  living in groups and those living in
              pairs.  The  investigators propose to monitor more than 100 social groups  per
              year  to measure reproductive success as a function of  group size and compare
              distribution of reproductive success  in males and females. They will do survey
              work in four  islands populations in order to have both high and low  habitat
              diversity.    The proposed work most likely will generate some interesting  and
              provocative ideas about how ecological forces may affect  mating systems.  ***
