Abstract    :
              9722797  Krainer  A conference on "Eukaryotic mRNA Processing" will convene
              scientists studying various aspects of mRNA splicing and 3' -end processing
              mechanisms and regulation in metazoans and in yeast. Major advances have
              recently been made in these areas, and the conference will be a timely event
              for discussing the latest unpublished results and exchanging ideas, thereby
              fostering new developments in this rapidly moving field.  The conference is a
              new international meeting to be held every other year at Cold Spring Harbor
              Laboratory.  The first meeting will be held on August 20 - 24, 1997, and is
              expected to attract 300-400 scientists who are actively investigating various
              aspects of messenger RNA maturation in eukaryotic cells, using genetic,
              biochemical, molecular, and cell biological approaches.  The major focus of the
              first meeting will be on nuclear events in mRNA maturation, particularly mRNA
              splicing and polyadenylation.  It will include eight plenary sessions and two
              poster sessions.  Speakers in the plenary sessions will be selected on the
              basis of the submitted abstracts, which will encourage active participation by
              junior scientists.  The main topics covered will include catalytic mechanisms
              and specificity of mRNA splicing and 3' -end processing; developmental and
              cell-type specific regulation of gene expression by alternative splicing and
              polyadenylation; structure and function of snRNP particles and of hnRNPs, SR
              proteins, PRPs, and other yeast and metazoan protein factors involved in
              splicing or polyadenylation; spliceosome assembly; and localization and
              dynamics of processing reactions, factors, substrates, and products, in
              relation to nuclear architecture and to nuclear-cytoplasmic transport.   The
              proper regulation of gene expression is essential to all life.  One fundamental
              mode of regulation is the processing of RNA transcripts of genes.  At this
              international meeting, between 300 and 400 scientists will gather to share,
              discuss, and analyze the most recent results and i deas in this field of mRNA
              processing in eukaryotes.  ***
