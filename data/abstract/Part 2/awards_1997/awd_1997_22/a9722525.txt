Abstract    :
              9722525  Eliel    This U.S.-Mexico award will help to support the  participation
              of 20 early-career invitees to the Fifth  Chemical Congress of North America,
              which is to take place  in Cancun, Quintana Roo, Mexico, November 11-15, 1997. 
              The  activity is under the joint sponsorship of the American  Chemical Society,
              the Canadian Society for Chemistry, and  the Sociedad Qu mica de Mexico. 
              Activities at the Congress  will include the presentation of papers, panel
              discussions,  symposia, and other programs reporting the results of recent 
              research in the chemical sciences to enhance the  dissemination and exchange of
              chemical knowledge by  scientists of the countries of North America.  The
              Congress  will include symposia in analytical and environmental  chemistry,
              chemical education, inorganic and physical  chemistry.  A one-day workshop will
              be held to generate  plans for improving chemistry cooperation in the Americas.
               Selection of the early career participants will be on the  basis of their
              contributions to symposia in their fields.    ***
