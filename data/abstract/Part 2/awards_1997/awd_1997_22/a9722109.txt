Abstract    :
              Fully general relativistic numerical calculations of the  gravitational
              radiation produced by the dynamics of compact  objects will be carried out by
              PI Centrella in collaboration  with senior colleagues.  One important class of
              sources  concerns rapidly rotating stellar cores that have expended  their
              nuclear fuel and are prevented from undergoing further  collapse by centrifugal
              forces.  The development of the bar  instability in such an object will produce
              gravitational  radiation and may shed enough angular momentum to allow full 
              collapse to a supernova.  In addition, coalescing compact  binaries are the
              main target sources for the ground-based  interferometers.  Numerical modeling
              is needed to calculate  the details of the actual coalescence.  In particular,
              the  frequency at which the stars begin their final plunge,  spiralling in
              faster than they would on purely point mass  trajectories, as well as other
              details of the coalescence  waveforms and spectra may yield valuable
              information about  neutron star radii and the nuclear equation of state.
