Abstract    :
                   This is a continuing research project for the study of  many of the
              unsolved problems in chiral Potts or generalized  chiral clock models.  Special
              cases have been introduced as  effective models for the study of incommensurate
              states,  wetting, and commensurate-incommensurate phase transitions.  Such
              phenomena can occur in surface layers when the  molecules in different layers
              have incompatible sizes; an  example is ripple states in biomembranes.  From a 
              mathematical point of view, this research addresses a new  class of cyclic
              hypergeometric functions, related to exact  solutions found recently.       New
              results will be pursued and connections between  various fields of mathematics,
              physics, and other sciences  will be further explored. New structures and
              models will be  investigated further with analytic means, symbolic 
              manipulation and numerical techniques, such as Monte Carlo  analysis and
              systems on finite strips with mean fields on  the boundaries. This should lead
              to better understanding of  more general models.
