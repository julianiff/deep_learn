Abstract    :
              Izen  9722501    This award supports a collaborative research project between 
              Dr. Joseph Izen of the  University of Texas at Dallas and  Dr. Tadao Nozaki of
              the National Laboratory for High Energy  Physics (KEK) in Tsukuba, Japan on
              "Development of a Geant4-  based Simulation of the BELLE Detector at the KEK b-
               Factory."  Dr. Izen will spend one year working on this  project in Japan. 
              The BELLE and BABAR experiments under  construction in Japan and the United
              States will explore CP  violating asymmetries in the decays of select B mesons
              and  will test theories of why those mesons and their  antiparticles have
              slight differences in behavior.  A new  computer language is being developed
              and applied to the  management and interpretation of data from high energy 
              physics experiments.  The goal of this project is to  implement a BELLE
              simulation using the new language.    Recording, reconstructing and extracting
              physics from  increasingly large data samples is a formidable challenge. 
              Particle physicists from the United States, Japan and around  the world are
              reinventing the computing environment of their  experiments.  This
              collaborative research project will  provide information on software and design
              strategies that  will benefit high energy physics experiments now under 
              development in both the United States and Japan.  The  project is supported
              under the Science Fellowship Program  between the National Science Foundation
              and the Japan  Foundation Center for Global Partnership.  ***
