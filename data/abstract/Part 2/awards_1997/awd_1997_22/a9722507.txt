Abstract    :
              9722507  Ingle    This U.S.-Mexico award will support a research collaboration 
              between Prof. James Ingle of Stanford University and Prof.  Rodolfo Cruz-Orozco
              of the Centro Interdisciplinario de  Ciencias Marinas in La Paz, Mexico.  The
              researchers aim to  study unusual and geologically important subtropical
              shallow  water carbonate environments in the La Paz area of Baja  California
              Sur, Mexico.  Results of this research will have  immediate application to the
              interpretation of the modern,  Quaternary, and Cenozoic oceanographic and
              paleoclimatic  history of this climatically sensitive region; understanding 
              the formation and preservation of carbonate sediments in  tectonically active
              settings; and monitoring and protection  of fragile marine environments in a
              proposed ecological  reserve.    This project will help to further
              international scientific  collaboration between Mexican and U.S. scientists and
               graduate students and will substantially broaden our  understanding of the
              little studied but environmentally  unique and geologically important shallow
              carbonate  environments of the southern Gulf of California.  ***
