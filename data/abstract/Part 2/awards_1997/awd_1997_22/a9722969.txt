Abstract    :
              IBN-9722969   Gabor Tigyi    The goal of this research is to understand the
              fundamental  mechanisms that regulate the development of neuronal  connections
              in the brain.  Past research by this group has  led to the discovery of a novel
              group of molecules  (lysophosphatidates) that inhibit the outgrowth of neuronal
               processes that provide the wiring of the nervous system.  Interestingly, these
              molecules are generated after injury to  the central nervous system and might
              impair its regeneration  and recovery of function after such events as spinal
              cord  injury, stroke, and brain hemorrhage.  The work proposed for  the next
              6-12 months will investigate the molecular signals  that mediate this
              inhibitory effect.  Specifically, we will  generate, using molecular biological
              techniques, special  cell lines that are deficient in one of three key
              molecular  switches, Cdc42, Rac, and Rho, which are presumably involved  in the
              inhibitory effect.  By using these engineered neuron-  like cells, we will be
              able to answer which of these three  switches need(s) to be turned on for the
              inhibition to take  place.  Once the switches mediating the inhibitory effect 
              are determined, they will become potential targets for drug  development and
              therefore could lead to novel treatments  that can prevent paralysis in
              patients suffering from lack  of regeneration in the central nervous system.
