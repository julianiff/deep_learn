Abstract    :
              9722854  Monk    The Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of
              Delaware will purchase a four processor computer with 640Mbytes of memory and
              15.6Gbytes of disk space which will be dedicated to the support of research in
              the mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for several research
              projects, including in particular    Mathematical modeling for thin liquid film
              drainage,  A posteriori error estimation for integral equations,  Adaptive
              estimation of linear functions in electromagnetism.
