Abstract    :
              Droegemeier  9722772    This award supports the participation of American 
              researchers in a U.S.-Korea seminar on "Storm- and Mesoscale  Weather Analysis
              and Prediction" to be held in Seoul, Korea  in October 1997.  The co-organizers
              are Professors Kelvin  Droegemeier of the University of Oklahoma and Dong-Kyou
              Lee  of Seoul National University.  This seminar will bring  together leading
              researchers to discuss storm- and mesoscale  meteorology.  The goal of the
              seminar is to integrate,  through scientific exchange and the initiation of
              specific  collaborative projects, research efforts in Korea and the  United
              States to significantly advance the technology of  operational weather analysis
              and prediction in both  countries.    The feasibility of site-specific weather
              forecasting is made  plausible by recent technological advancements, such as 
              improved means of sensing the environment at a relatively  high resolution, and
              the availability of powerful parallel  computer resources to run mesoscale
              numerical weather  prediction systems.  The potential impact and value of 
              locally accurate weather forecasts on society and the  economy are enormous. 
              The United States and Korea have  common research interests in this area and
              both countries  exhibit state-of-the-art observation networks.  The exchange 
              of ideas and data with Korean experts will enable U.S.  participants to advance
              their own work, and will set the  stage for future collaborative projects.  ***
