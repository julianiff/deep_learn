Abstract    :
              The investigators are using several Fabry-Perot instruments to study
              thermospheric and mesospheric small scale structures in wind and temperature. 
              In addition to mapping horizontal vectors of upper mesospheric wind, they
              obtain wind observations at the highest possible time resolution.  Then, they
              study vertical wind characteristics and associated occurrences resolving
              spatial/temporal ambiguities.  Thus, the specific objectives of their research
              are (1) imaging the vector wind field in the upper mesosphere, (2) obtaining
              temporal and spatial variances in upper mesospheric winds, temperatures and
              emission rates, as well as the spectral characteristics of fluctuations, and
              (3) testing the hypothesis that there is no statistically significant variation
              in distributed variance of wind or temperature emission rate measurements as a
              function of position in the all-sky view.
