Abstract    :
              9720612  McCauley-Bell, Pamela  University of Central Florida    POWRE:  An
              Investigation of Interaction Between Human and Automation Elements in Alerting
              Systems    The PI plans to visit the Humans and Automation Division of the
              Aerospace and Aeronautical Engineering Department of MIT with the objectives as
              defined in the program of Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and
              Education (POWRE): to achieve professional growth, career advancement, and
              increased prominence.  The proposed activities will be centered around the
              theme of her research utilizing high risk, complex and automated systems for
              monitoring and control of numerous environments.  Techniques and methodologies
              for successful human and intelligent system interaction with respect to
              emergency alerting systems will be explored.  Human performance to alarm
              situations with and without the presence of the intelligent agent will be
              evaluated (response time and accuracy of results).
