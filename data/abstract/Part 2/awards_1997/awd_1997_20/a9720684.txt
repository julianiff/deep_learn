Abstract    :
              The severity of environmental and economic problems in Eastern Europe following
              the fall of communism in 1989 provides a useful laboratory for examining the
              relationship between perceptions of environmental risks and economic
              opportunities.  Environmental activism appeared to be a driving force behind
              economic and political change in Eastern Europe, yet in the mid-1990s
              environmentalism appeared to have lost considerable political momentum,
              suggesting that the relationships among environmentalism, economic factors, and
              political change are more complex than previously thought.    This study
              proposes that the relationship between risk perception and environmental policy
              is influenced by perceptions of the nature of the environmental problem(s) and
              economic factors, and by the political and policy context.  These influences on
              risk perception and environmental policy in both developed and transitional
              societies are poorly understood.  In this study, a detailed survey of risk
              perceptions in a heavily stressed region of Bulgaria  -- the Burgas area, which
              has suffered considerable environmental damage from the Neftochim petrochemical
              plant, as well as from heavy pesticide and fertilizer use in the area -- will
              be used to test a model in which perceptions of riskiness and intentions to act
              to reduce a risk are the result of two attributes of the risk: (1) perceptions
              of exposure to the risk, and (2) perceptions of costs and benefits to
              individuals and to society from the hazard; these attributes are moderated by
              (a) knowledge and beliefs about the hazard underlying the risk (i.e., mental
              models), (b) beliefs about the ability of individuals or of groups or
              organizations to reduce or increase the risk, and (c) uncertainty about the
              risk.  Bulgaria is a prime example of countries in which the tradeoffs between
              the economy and the environment are highly salient. And while specifics of
              attitudes are likely to differ from, for example, those found in the U.S., the
              general structure of risk attitudes has been found to be similar to that in
              other countries. As illustrated by the scope of current U.S. and international
              environmental aid to Eastern Europe, the global community does not want
              developing countries to neglect the environment in their pursuit of economic
              growth. This project will contribute to our ability to accomplish this.  In
              short, this project will investigate the interplay of environmental concerns,
              economic factors, and attitudes about politics and legal protections in order
              to improve our understanding of citizens' concerns, and to enhance our ability
              to balance environmental considerations with other objectives.       S u m m a
