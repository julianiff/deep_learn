Abstract    :
              9720675  Elliott    The objective of this project is to develop minimum distance
              methods for inference in cointegrated time series regressions and short panel
              data models.  Cointegrated models have found particular favor among applied
              researchers because of their direct relationship with economic theory, i.e.,
              distinguishing between long-run and short-run dynamics.   Minimum distance
              methods appear to provide ideal methods for estimating and conducting inference
              on these models.  This is very useful as current methods of estimation of
              cointegrating models have proven quite difficult to extend in directions that
              are useful to applied econometricians.  Methods are often special to the
              problems of cointegration per se or result in complicated computational
              methods.  In most situations closed form solutions are available for estimation
              when minimum distance methods are applied.  These methods are very simple and
              well understood enabling fairly simple extension of methods for estimation of
              cointegrated models in directions that should prove useful in applied work. 
              The particular extensions envisaged for time series models are estimation when
              there are restrictions on the cointegrating vectors (linear or nonlinear,
              within or across equation), the presence of stationary variables, and the
              presence of heteroskedasticity.  In the panel models, the project will be to
              provide and evaluate estimators and rules for inference in short time dimension
              panel data sets when observations on many individuals are available.  The focus
              of this model is to incorporate as much heterogeneity across individuals as
              possible.  These methods will be extended also in the same direction as the
              time series models.      ??
