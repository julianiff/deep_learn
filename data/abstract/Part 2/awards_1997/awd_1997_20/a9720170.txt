Abstract    :
              9720170  Landau, David P.  University of Georgia    Acquisition of a Symmetric
              Multiprocessor Scientific Computer System    The University of Georgia is
              upgrading its parallel scientific computing facility to a 24-node Silicon
              Graphics Origin 2000 High Performance Computer System to advance a
              multidisciplinary activity in intelligent multiscale scientific simulations. 
              This platform has the flexibility to run several jobs at once in mixed
              configurations and will allow a user to run programs requiring distributed
              memory processing.    Research areas to be supported range from parallel
              computing, artificial intelligence, optimization and interoperability issues,
              scalable parallel algorithm design for nuclear physics, fluid flow modeling,
              materials simulation, molecular modeling, quantum chemistry, polymer modeling,
              and geological modeling.    The proposed computing facility will allow the
              University to continue and expand its educational programs in computational
              sciences.  In addition to graduate students participating in the research
              projects described in the proposal, existing undergraduate and graduate courses
              in computational physics, biology, simulation methods, and business process
              modeling will utilize the proposed facility.
