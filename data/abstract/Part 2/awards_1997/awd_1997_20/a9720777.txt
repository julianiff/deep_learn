Abstract    :
              The investigator incorporates a partially ionized plasma state into the
              'anelastic' fluid equations describing the solar convection zone, enabling a
              simulation of solar supergranulation.  This phenomenon, first discovered in
              1964, may have a connection with one of the ionization zones of hydrogen or
              helium occurring at about 30,000 kilometers.  Investigators are now testing
              this hypothesis through numerical simulation, and including a variety of
              physical effects in the proposed model.  Their simulations of the fluid
              mechanics of plasma where constituent elements may undergo ionization when
              heated minimize perturbations, causing only slight deviations from the basic
              equilibrium thermodynamic state.  This anelastic approximation holds throughout
              the solar convection zone, except very close to the photosphere.  The
              investigators' tests increase in complexity over the three-year program,
              finally extending the model to three dimensions and pursuing large-scale
              simulations of turbulent, ionizing MHD convection.  Research results will
              reveal much about the physics of solar supergranulation.
