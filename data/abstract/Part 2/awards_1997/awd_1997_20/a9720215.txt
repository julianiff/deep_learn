Abstract    :
              Lack of effective performance evaluation and prediction environment is a major
              barrier to the broader use of high performance computing.  Conventional
              performance environments are based on profiling and event instrumentation.  For
              a system with p processors, there are 2 DSG1 p-p-1 potential parallel sub-task
              interactions. As parallel systems scale to hundreds of nodes and beyond, the
              conventional execution profiling approach becomes problematic.  Moreover, there
              are many ways to parallelize an application, and the relative performance of
              different parallelizations varies with problem size and system ensemble size. 
              The objective of the proposed research is to explore the relevant issues in
              designing and developing an integrated, concrete, and robust SCALability
              Analyzer (SCALA) system for performance modeling and prediction of high
              performance computing programs.   DSG1
