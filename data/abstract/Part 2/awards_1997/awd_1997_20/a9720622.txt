Abstract    :
              9720622  Kieffaber     In this project,  the nighttime airglow from neutral
              atoms and molecules will be observed at four wavelengths which originate at
              four different heights in the atmosphere. An existing all-sky imager will be
              upgraded by incorporating a cooled CCD device which produces digitzed images. 
              The all-sky images will record the detailed structure of airglow emissions
              while an eight-channel photometer measures intensities at four airglow
              wavelengths. These data  will be analyzed to determine wavelengths and speeds
              of gravity waves passing through the airglow layers. The small scale structure
              and fluctuations will give information about turbulence and energy dissipation
              caused by the passage of gravity waves. The photometer also measures the
              intensity of the airglow continuum at four wavelengths; analysis of these data
              can enhance understanding of the photochemical and dynamic processes occurring
              at these atmospheric heights. The research will add to an existing data base
              covering eight years and three latitudes.   This project is supported by the
              POWRE program, which will allow the PI to spend a sabbatical focusing on this
              research, and involve undergraduate students in the project. Despite being at
              an undergraduate institution, the PI has maintained strong ties to the CEDAR
              (Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions) community but has
              not been able to devote significant amounts of her time to research.
