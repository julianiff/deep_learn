Abstract    :
               9720523   Beck    The PI will consider the investigation and construction of
              multivariable pharmacodynamic models to describe human response to anesthesia. 
              The modeling framework used will be that of uncertain systems, with the goal of
              developing robust feedback control methods for the purposes of automated
              anesthesia delivery.  This award, the PI's first federally funded research
              grant,  will allow her to establish an entirely new approach to patient
              modeling and the use of control in bioengineering systems, as well as to
              advance the implementation of modern control techniques for uncertain systems
              in general.  ***
