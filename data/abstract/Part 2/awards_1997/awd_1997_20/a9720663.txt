Abstract    :
              9720663  Edelson    This effort integrates a research program in the development
              of educational technologies and educational program that will provide
              undergraduate and graduate students with experiences in the design and study of
              these technologies.  The research component of this effort will develop a
              software architecture for science learning environments that engage students in
              design tasks involving everyday devices.  The goal of this Designing to Learn
              architecture is to use the task of design and the topic of everyday things to
              provide a context that motivates learning and supports the application of
              scientific principles in familiar settings.
