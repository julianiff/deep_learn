Abstract    :
              9720570  Robinson  Misfolding or misassembly of proteins is a major problem in 
              the biotechnology industry, in biochemical research, and in  human disease. 
              Folding problems limit production of  commercially important proteins, and
              existing methods of  recovering native protein from aggregates are often 
              inefficient and time-consuming.  Aggregation has also been  identified as the
              cause of a number of human diseases,  including cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer's
              disease, and prion  spongiform encephalopathies such as Creutzfeldt-Jacob 
              disease.  In order to address the aggregation problems in  production and to
              understand the molecular determinants that  drive aggregation in vivo and in
              vitro, the research plan is  to investigate the inhibition and reversal of
              protein  aggregation of P22 tailspike by application of hydrostatic  pressure. 
              The results obtained will serve as a foundation  for studying other important
              protein systems, of both  industrial and medical relevance.  ***
