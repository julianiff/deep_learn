This project will develop link-time and run-time
              techniques for improving the performance of scientific programs.  The overall
              goal is to increase the performance of both existing and new codes, whatever
              the source programming language, algorithm, application, or target
              architectures.  

This project considers how tools for link-time and run-time
              optimization of advanced scientific programs can be constructed.  Specifically,
              the following topics are investigated:

1. Link-time program analysis.  The
              project will develop techniques for efficient and useful whole-program
              analysis, aimed at focusing the analysis effort on program components whose
              analysis and/or optimization can contribute to tangible improvements in program
              performance.

2. Whole-program optimization at link time. The project will
              investigate optimizations of executable programs, using classical techniques
              such as inlining applied to library code, as well as optimizations aimed at
              exploiting specific characteristics of the underlying hardware.

3. Run-time
              optimization.  The project will also investigate optimizations that depend on
              values that are computed while an application executes; these include
              optimizations that effect the amount of concurrency in a parallel application
              as well as how communication and synchronization are realized.
