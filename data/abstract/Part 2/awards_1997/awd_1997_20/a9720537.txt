Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT  CTS-9720537  Perla B. Balbuena    Professor Balbuena will
              investigate theoretically the intercalcation of lithium into solid electrode,
              the diffusion of lithium through the electrolyte, the formation of surface film
              on the electrodes, and the influence of much film on electrochemical behavior
              of electrodes.  An application of this research is in Li-ion batteries
              development.  Quantum ab initio and molecular dynamics simulations will be used
              to characterize electronic, atomic, and molecular properties of these systems. 
              This research will allow Professor Balbuena, a recently appointed Assistant
              Professor, to strengthen her career in the area of computational prediction of
              electrochemical and materials properties.
