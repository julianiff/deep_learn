Abstract    :
              9720470  Scarlatos, Lori L.  CUNY Brooklyn College    Smart Object Interfaces
              for Collaborative Learning Environments     Smart objects are physical objects
              that serve as input devices to a   computer system. This effort aims to use
              pieces of a physical puzzle --   such as the Towers of Hanoi -- as smart
              objects that will help K-12   students to understand and appreciate
              mathematical and scientific concepts. The goal is to reach those students who
              are currently turned off by math and science, providing a way for them to learn
              collaboratively by manipulating real objects in the world around them.    The
              PI will use this planning grant to study the feasibility of this new research
              direction, and to devise a sound technical approach for implementing smart
              object interfaces for collaborative learning environments. Unlike traditional
              interfaces, a computer system employing smart objects must track multiple input
              devices in a three-dimensional space in real time, distinguishing between
              objects and accounting for precision errors.  Current sensor technologies are
              being examined to discover their capabilities and limitations. The PI is
              talking with other researchers and sensor experts and also exploring the
              software issues, aiming to ultimately develop a set of smart object interface
              tools. This effort will culminate in a long-term research plan and the
              beginnings of a new research laboratory.
