Abstract    :
                      9720147  BAIRNSFATHER  This award provides funding for computer
              networking  equipment that will establish a "backbone" of T3 ATM service 
              (upgradable to OC3) to connect 11 institutions in 5 major  cities throughout
              the state of Louisiana.  It builds on and  upgrades an existing network in
              Louisiana and will connect  the state to a multi-state network through
              Louisiana State  University's participation in the South East Partnership to  
              Share Computational Resources (SEPSCoR).  It will also  position Louisiana for
              submission of a strongly competitive  proposal to NSF's program for connections
              to the Next  Generation Internet.  Additional support is provided for the 
              salary and benefits of a network manager (to be recruited).   The funds
              provided by this award are only a small portion of  the total projected costs
              of the project; strong commitment  to developing the network is evidenced by
              major (ca. 90%)  non-federal cost sharing from the state and industry.  The 
              network will make available high performance computing  capabilities necessary
              for scientists conducting research in  a broad variety of disciplines and
              encompassing both basic  and applied research.
