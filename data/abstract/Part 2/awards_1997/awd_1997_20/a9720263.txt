              AST-9720263  ABSTRACT - J. Weatherall and J. Eilek    MAGNETIZED STRONG PLASMA
              TURBULENCE AND PARTICLE ACCELERATION    A new study of strong plasma turbulence
              combines theoretical and  computational tools to address two important
              questions. One is the  dynamics of magnetized strong turbulence. This study
              addresses the  connection of large-scale Alfvenic turbulence to small-scale
              lower  hybrid turbulence via the coupling of modes in strong turbulence 
              processes. The second question is the role of turbulence in the  energization
              of relativistic particles. This other study analyzes the  dissipation of
              magnetized turbulence through transit-time damping. Such  damping should be an
              effective accelerator of a high energy component  of the plasma to relativistic
              energies.    The research is particularly relevant to the area of particle 
              acceleration in astrophysical plasmas, where the role of strong plasma 
              turbulence has not been studied. The results of the research may lead  to
              essential new physics for the energization of relativistic particles  in
              clusters of galaxies.    The program of research addresses basic issues of
              turbulent structure  in magnetized plasmas, relativistic plasmas, and cosmic
              plasmas.
