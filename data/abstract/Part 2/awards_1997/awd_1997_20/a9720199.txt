Abstract    :
                This project will explore three different topics important for the compilation
              of scientific computations for high-performance computers:  Fine-grained
              compiler analysis and transformations:  The PIs will continue their work on
              fine-grained synchronization removal and program splicing, and explore other
              analyses and transformations that could benefit from being made fine-grained. 
              Algorithms for Presburger arithmetic and beyond:  Performing fine-grained
              analyses and transformations requires the use of fine-grained tools for
              representing things such as the dependencies in a program, or arithmetic
              constraints.  The PIs will investigate new algorithms and approaches to obtain
              significant performance improvements.  Efficient sparse matrix code from
              high-level specifications: The PIs will investigate techniques that allow
              sparse matrix algorithms to be written in a clean high-level form.  
              Information about special data structures and other complications will be
              specified in a way similar to HPF data distributions.
