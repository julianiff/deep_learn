Abstract    :
              It is important for scientific investigators, engineers, and developers to be
              able to interact with their high performance applications running on parallel
              or distributed machines.  This project will explore technologies to enable the
              flexible and interactive use of computational instruments, including on-line
              monitoring, analysis, steering, and experimentation.  In addition it will
              permit users to exploit the new functionalities enabled by future integrated
              computing, networking, and user interface platforms, which include 'looking
              over a colleague's shoulder' from a remote location, sharing the outputs of
              computational instruments among multiple users or instruments, working
              concurrently on the same problem using high quality visualization techniques or
              immersive environments, or jointly operating a single shared computational
              tool, or even temporarily working on alternative or complementary tasks which
              are then reintegrated with ongoing experiments or processes.
