Abstract    :
              The PI's propose to develop an environment for visualization and interactive
              computational steering on a network of distributed workstations.  The
              visualization and steering front-end being implemented will be capable of
              interacting using a client-server model with a computational engine, which
              could also reside on  a parallel computer, in addition to the distributed
              network of computers which is the main target architecture.  The target
              application of this environment will be 3-dimensional liquid crystal material
              in a confined geometry.  The model used will be based on the Landau-de Gennes
              theory.  In particular, one is interested in the changes in the degree of order
              and orientation of the liquid crystals as the temperature is varied.  Knowledge
              about the properties of liquid crystals is of importance, for example, for the
              design of liquid displays.  The target application is characteristic of a class
              of problems which would benefit significantly from computational steering,
              since it has multiple solutions with different symmetry structures and exhibits
              bifurcation or turning-point behavior for certain values of the determining
              parameters.  Hence this is a path following or continuation problem.
