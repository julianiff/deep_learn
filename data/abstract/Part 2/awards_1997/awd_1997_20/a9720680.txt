Abstract    :
                9720680  Dushaw    The project will use acoustic data obtained during the 
              Acoustic Mid-ocean Dynamics Experiment (AMODE) to study  internal-tide
              properties in the western North Atlantic. The  initial part is to finish the
              work on antenna properties of  the tomography array.  The results will be
              extended by  calculating the energy flux, and comparing that to tidal  models. 
              The data will be used to examine the refraction of  diurnal waves at turning
              latitude.  Another goal is to  develop 2- and 3-D internal tide modeling
              capability to  support the acoustical observations. SEOM models will be  used.
