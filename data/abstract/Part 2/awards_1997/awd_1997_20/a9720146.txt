Abstract    :
                    9720146  DRAAYER  This award will provide funds for the planning and 
              conducting of the 13th Annual NSF Experimental Program to  Stimulate
              Competitive Research (EPSCoR) Conference to be  held 1-4 December 1997 at the
              Fairmont Hotel in New Orleans,  Louisiana.  This regular conference is a very
              important  forum in which participants from all 19 EPSCoR jurisdictions  (there
              are 18 EPSCoR states plus the Commonwealth of Puerto  Rico) can come together
              to exchange information and ideas  critical to research and development (R&D)
              in EPSCoR states.  The award will provide travel, subsistence, and conference 
              registration support for five participants from each EPSCoR  state and for a
              number of additional important invited  speakers and guests.  For the 1997
              conference teams from  each state will be featured with prominent
              representatives  from their academic, industrial, and state governmental 
              communities.  These teams will present success stories along  with strategies
              for addressing changing R&D funding  scenarios.  Such sharing can provide very
              valuable insights  for participants because a success story in one realm for a 
              particular state may suggest a promising strategy for  another state to pursue.
               Conference proceedings will be  produced for distribution to all participants.
