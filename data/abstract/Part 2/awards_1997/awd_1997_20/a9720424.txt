Abstract    :
              9720424  Hauser    The purpose of this award is to provide funds for the
              Engineering Research Center at North Carolina State University on Advanced
              Microelectronic Devices to collaborate with Rutgers University, International
              Business Machines, and Lucent Technologies to add expertise  in the area of
              advanced characterization of electronic materials and device performance. 
              Rutgers University is a center of excellence in ion beam and x-ray
              photoelectron spectroscopy, and IBM and Lucent  Technologies add expertise in
              characterization of device performance.  The Engineering Research Center has
              succeeded in producing thin film nitrided stacked gate electronic device
              structures that have the potential for application in commercial markets.  This
              collaborative effort will provide understanding of the chemical and physical
              structure of these structures at the mono-atomic layer level.  This
              understanding is necessary if the devices are to be accepted by the industry. 
              The research consists of three tasks:  1) materials synthesis (NC State),  2)
              ion beam and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Rutgers University), and  3)
              definition of materials specifications at the monolayer level for advanced
              device structures (IBM and Lucent).  One of the main goals is to transfer
              knowledge gained in this research to industry.
