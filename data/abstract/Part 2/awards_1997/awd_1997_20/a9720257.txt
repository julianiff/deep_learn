Abstract    :
              This project will investigate efficient multigrid (MG) and domain decomposition
              (DD) algorithms for elliptic and non-elliptic problems on arbitrary
              unstructured meshes, which are suitable for distributed and shared memory
              parallel computing architectures.  Three aspects of DD and MG will be
              emphasized in this work: (1) Performance of various DD and MG algorithms on
              parallel computers with particular attention paid to communication and cache
              memory latency.  (2) Design of optimized DD and MG "gray box" libraries for
              elliptic and advection dominated problems, which exploit optional information
              supplied by the user.  (3) Theoretical analysis and practical design of DD and
              MG algorithm appropriate for advection dominated problems.  Particular emphasis
              will be placed on DD and MG algorithms for solving the discretization matrices
              arising from a variety of large scale scientific computing problems, such as
              computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for advection dominated problems, image
              processing, photolithography, and the modeling of microchip performance and
              fabrication.  The non-elliptic behavior of these practical problems renders the
              known multigrid and decomposition theory inadequate and serves to motivate a
              balanced effort consisting of algorithmic development, theoretical analysis,
              and practical application.
