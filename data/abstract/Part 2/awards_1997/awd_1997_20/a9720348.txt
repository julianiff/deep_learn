Abstract    :
              9720348  McClelland    Given that learning takes place at the connections
              between neurons, the pattern of connectivity between brain areas representing
              different types of information has a strong influence on how hard or easy it is
              to learn to relate various types of information.  The research combines
              experimental investigation of skill training procedures, computational
              modeling, functional brain imaging, and automated tutoring in to improve
              understanding of the brain mechanisms that implement the principles.  The work
              also aims to apply, evaluate, and refine training procedures to produce
              concrete improvements in the reading proficiency of both normal and
              reading-impaired children.  The results will have important implications not
              only for the theory and practice of reading education, but also for the
              effective training of cognitive skills more generally.
