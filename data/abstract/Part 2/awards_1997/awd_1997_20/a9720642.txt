Abstract    :
              9720642     Benfield  The three South Dakota research universities, South Dakota
              State  University, the University of South Dakota, and South Dakota School of 
              Mines and Technology, will collaborate to develop infrastructure that  promotes
              competitiveness on the part of individual investigators.   Another partner in
              this project is the Earth Resources Observation  Systems (EROS) Data Center, a
              federal facility located in the state.   Infrastructure development and
              co-funding endorsement will be in the  context of three scientific areas and
              one supporting area, all chosen  for their relationship to the South Dakota
              economy, for the existence  of scientific talent in the state, and for the
              inherent potential for  independent fundability.  The scientific focus areas
              are:  (1)  Biological Response to Stress; (2) Geophysical Processes of the 
              Northern Plains; and (3) Materials and Processes for the 21st Century.   The
              supporting technical area is telecommunications and information  technology. 
              In addition, infrastructure development activities will  be carried out.  Such
              activities will include: (1) new faculty start-  up costs to assist new faculty
              members in establishing laboratories  for their research and for purchasing
              scientific equipment; (2)  investigator special travel awards provided
              specifically for faculty  to travel to funding agencies in Washington to
              discuss grant  opportunities and procedures; (3) Rushmore Conferences to host a
               national conference in South Dakota in each of the three primary focus  areas
              as well as two special conferences on "Native Americans in  Science," and "The
              Scientist as Entrepreneur;" (4) graduate  fellowships, nine special fellowships
              each year to attract the best  students to South Dakota; (5) undergraduate
              research fellowships, to  support a total of 30 undergraduates every year in
              summer research  involvement; (6) a joint industry program with North Dakota to
              place  students in industrial internships; (7) an annual state EPSCoR 
              conference held in the st ate, including a joint conference with North  Dakota
              in 1999; (8) a seminar series, enabling each primary focus  group to host two
              national speakers per year by bringing them to one  campus and broadcasting
              their visit interactively to the other  schools; (9) a proposal enhancement
              program to provide small grants to  faculty who submit proposals to major
              external funding agencies,  coupled with proposal-writing workshops; and (10)
              equipment funds to  purchase state-of-the-art research instrumentation related
              to the  above focus areas, which will permit South Dakota faculty to carry out 
              competitive research.
