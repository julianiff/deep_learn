Abstract    :
              The quality of vision is significantly influenced by the shape of the cornea,
              and even subtle shape variations, at the micron level, can have significant
              effects on visual performance.  The proposed research will develop effective
              scientific visualization techniques for the cornea.  In such areas as eye
              disease diagnosis, eye surgery, and the design and fabrication of corrective
              contact lenses, the need for more precise measurements is apparent.  Improved
              scientific visualization techniques will convey to a clinician the shape of a
              cornea to aid in the fitting of lens, the acuity of the visual field and after
              surgery, and will show how modifying the parameters of a contact lens affects
              its shape.
