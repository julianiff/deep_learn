Abstract    :
                9720491 Amato-Wierda  This project aims to introduce a complementary line of
              inquiry in the area of gas-phase chemistry of plasma enhanced chemical vapor
              deposition (PECVD) to the PI's research program through analysis of the
              gas-phase composition during PECVD by molecular beam mass spectrometry (MBMS).
              The gas-phase neutral, ion, and radical species, as well as their kinetics and
              mechanisms, will be correlated with process variables and final film
              properties. The project is co-supported by the Division of Materials Research,
              and the MPS OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities). %%% This is a research
              enhancement grant made under the Professional Opportunities for Women in
              Research and Education (POWRE) program. The research will contribute basic
              materials science knowledge at a fundamental level of special relevance to the
              synthesis and processing of electronic materials. ***
