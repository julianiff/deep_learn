Abstract    :
              9720157  LUCAS  This award provides funding for establishment of an Alabama 
              Biomedical Implant Center that will integrate research activities  for 32
              researchers from six Alabama universities.  Primary goals  for the proposed
              center include 1) basic research in biochemical,  biomechanical and cellular
              responses elicited by the surgical  implantation of a prosthesis or other
              material in the human body;  2) technology transfer from the universities
              involved to state and  national industrial partners; and 3) research/training
              and industry  internship opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate 
              students.  A developmental grant program will support pilot  projects to obtain
              preliminary data and enhance the research  competitiveness of collaborating
              faculty.  Workshops and a  newsletter are planned for dissemination of
              information about  center activities and research results. The center is also 
              anticipated to serve as a resource, providing laboratory facilities  and
              technical advice for developing medical device companies.    This center will
              be unique in its emphasis on integration of  biomedical and tissue engineering
              research efforts.  The  partnerships with industry and emphasis on technology
              transfer, as  well as basic and applied research, will contribute to both 
              economic growth and development and the quality of health care in  Alabama.
