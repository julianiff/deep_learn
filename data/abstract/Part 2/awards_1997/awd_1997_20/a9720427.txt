Abstract    :
              9720427  Roesset    This award provides funding for the Engineering Research
              Center at Texas A&M University/University of Texas at Austin entitled "Offshore
              Technology Research Center" (OTRC) to work with researchers from the
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the Norwegian University of
              Science and Technology (NTNU) and MARINTEK (NTNU's commercial/research wave
              basin operation) to benchmark analytical results from numerical wave basin
              simulators and wave basin experiments at these institutions.  Benchmarking will
              be done comparing the results of the numerical wave tanks and algorithms
              developed at OTRC, MIT, and NTNU with experimental data from physical wave
              basin tests at OTRC and MARINTEK using a cylinder and a mini tension leg
              platform provided by the Norwegian oil company STATOIL.  This benchmarking will
              lead to improved numerical wave tank modeling and improved wave kinematics in a
              physical wave basin used to reproduce multidirectional sea states and the
              forces acting on structures under the conditions and effects of side
              reflections.  Eventually, well-developed numerical wave tanks will be able to
              complement or replace a number of very expensive physical model tests.
