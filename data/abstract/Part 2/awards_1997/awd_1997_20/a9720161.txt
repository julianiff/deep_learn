Abstract    :
                9720161  SCAMEHORN  This award will support continuation of a collaborative
              research   project involving faculty at the University of Oklahoma and Tulsa 
              University and Kimberly-Clark Corporation, an industry partner  based in
              Addison, Wisconsin.  Parallel research efforts will  address means of removing
              printed inks from plastic films used in  packaging along with development of
              alternative and more readily   removable inks (both research thrusts relate to
              production of  clear, recyclable plastic film).  Other industries have
              evidenced  interest in this developing technology.  The Advisory Board of  the
              University of Oklahoma s Institute for Applied Surfactant  Research will be
              asked to provide technology transfer advice in  this new area, at present, and
              the investigators are  contemplating establishment of a new Center for Deinking
              Studies   that would pursue both federal and industrial support to sustain  
              research leading to commercialization of environmentally safe 
              processes/products. Development of environmentally benign  processes for
              reducing environmental degradation (i.e. plastics  in landfills) is timely, of
              national and international interest,   and highly relevant for the packaging
              industry.  Prospects exist   for technology transfer and contributions to
              economic growth and   development in Oklahoma.
