Abstract    :
              The University of Missouri-Columbia requested support from NSF to  connect three
              satellite campuses of Southwest Baptist University,  a MOREnet higher education
              member to the Internet.  These campus  sites are located at Springfield,
              Mountain View and Salem.  These  sites will be connected through the Missouri
              Research and  Education Network.  Combined, these campuses have an enrollment
              of  nearly 1000 students.  The campuses needs the Internet connection  to be
              able to access information resources throughout the state,  the nation and the
              world.  The connection will benefit the  faculty, staff students of these
              institutions as well as the  community in general.  The award provides partial
              support of the  project for two years.
