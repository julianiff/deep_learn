Abstract    :
                      9720162  SPELL  This award provides funding to establish the Nevada
              Isotope  Geochronology Laboratory under the direction of Dr. Terry Spell  in
              the Department of Geoscience at the University of Nevada, Las   Vegas.  This
              facility will be able to process geological samples   from academic,
              industrial, and state and federal government  laboratories.  At present,
              researchers must wait for extended  periods of time to have samples processed
              at laboratories outside  of Nevada.  The laboratory will enhance research for
              scientists  investigating subject areas ranging from genesis of ore bearing 
              strata to dating of fossil materials.  In addition, the  specialized
              instrumentation capable of surface exposure dating of  very recent strata will
              be applicable to studies of climate  change, constraining erosion rates and
              volcanic hazards  assessment.  Support is provided primarily for equipment (a
              MAP  215-50 Rare Gas Mass Spectrometer and related instrumentation and 
              analytical equipment) and salary and benefits for a full-time  technician
              committed to running samples and maintaining the  instrumentation.   
              Establishment of a Geochronology Laboratory in Nevada will  provide important
              infrastructure of use in both basic and applied  research, facilitate the
              research of scientists from a breadth of  academic disciplines, and contribute
              to economic growth and  development in the state by serving industrial clients
              involved  in ore and petroleum exploration.
