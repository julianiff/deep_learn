Abstract    :
              Multi-dimensional transient partial differential systems are computationally
              demanding and may, for example, involve accident simulation, weather
              forecasting, chemical and material fabrication, turbulence, and combustion.
              Balancing computational loading on a parallel computer must be dynamic, since
              adaptivity by either h- or p-refinement will upset an initial balance.  Efforts
              to date have concentrated on h-refinement rather than the potentially more
              efficient p-refinement.    This research seeks to develop the technologies
              necessary to support effective and reliable adaptive computation for transient
              partial differential systems on heterogeneous parallel computing environments.
              These technologies will be incorporated into an extensible software framework
              and evaluated using applications involving fluid flow, material processing,
              chemical reaction, and crystal growth.
