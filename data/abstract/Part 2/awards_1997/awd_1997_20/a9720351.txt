Abstract    :
              9720351    Thomas Defanti  University of Illinois    Deep Learning And
              Visualization Techniques    This award is to study the use of visualization
              techniques in encouraging deep learning of concept.  The notion was initially
              developed on a virtual reality CAVE environment to illustrate the concept of
              gravity.  The PIs are studying other educational applications where a
              compelling case for virtual reality can be made.
