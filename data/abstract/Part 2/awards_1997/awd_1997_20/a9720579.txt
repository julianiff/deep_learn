Abstract    :
              9720579  Seiter, Linda  Santa Clara University    POWRE: Managing Dynamic
              Evolution in Object-Oriented Systems    A new construct called the adaptor
              relation is proposed.  The relation is intended to support dynamic evolution in
              object-oriented applications, and is relevant at both the design and
              implementation level.  The relation provides a solution to a number of popular
              design patterns that have demonstrated how awkward it is to model natural
              concepts of evolution when using a traditional object-oriented model.    This
              research incorporates the adaptor relation into the object-oriented model, and
              investigates new notions of dynamic binding that accompany the relation. 
              Alternative implementation techniques are compared on numerous aspects
              including efficiency, safety and scalability.   An existing implementation
              employs a preprocessor approach for parsing tagged Java code.  Implementations
              based on metaobject protocols are also investigated.    This project
              facilitates the Principle Investigator in establishing a strong presence as an
              expert on object-oriented software evolution.  Project funding also facilitates
              the Principal Investigator in developing relationships with Santa Clara
              University students through research collaboration.  The technical goal of the
              research is to support dynamic evolution within the realm of efficient, type
              safe languages.  Establishment of a two-way technology transfer with industry
              serves to provide a relevant research result.
