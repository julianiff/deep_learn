Abstract    :
                   9720687   Edelson      The WorldWatcher curriculum consists of two
              semester-long units; each unit includes learning activities, teacher support
              materials, science content materials, software and libraries of data.  The
              materials are inquiry-based science learning curricula based on the themes of
              global change and biodiversity that make integrated and extensive use of
              scientific visualization and data analysis.  The curriculum takes advantage of
              WorldWatcher, a scientific visualization and analysis environment for
              geographic data developed specifically for educational use.  The
              standards-based materials are designed for use in a variety of 8-12 grade
              courses including earth science, environmental science, biology, physics and
              chemistry.  The materials contain explicit support for teachers on developing
              new approaches to pedagogy and respect teachers' roles as local designers of
              curriculum, with guidance for adapting the curriculum to local objectives and
              constraints.
