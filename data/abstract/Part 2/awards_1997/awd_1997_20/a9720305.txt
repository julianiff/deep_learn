Abstract    :
              IBN-9720305  PI:  SHAPLEY     This project is being funded through the Learning
              & Intelligent Systems Initiative.  The questions involve vision and learning in
              the central nervous system.  The project investigates how the brain represents
              and processes perceptual information, and the adaptive changes that occur when
              the system learns and improves its performance.  Here the visual system is used
              as a gateway into the workings of the brain, employing methods from
              psychophysics, neurophysiology, mathematics and engineering.  The work focuses
              on visual grouping, which is the ability of the visual system to link together
              local elements of the visual image into coherent wholes.  Grouping is one of
              the most fundamental aspects of human vision, and the goal of this work is to
              obtain a theory of visual grouping that will explain the physiological and
              psychophysical data, and lead to new technological ideas to be applied in
              intelligent artificial systems.     Results will be important because
              understanding the computations in the brain that produce grouping would be a
              leap forward in our understanding of brain function, and of any systems that
              can adapt to experience.  This work will therefore have an impact in designing
              learning materials and in the optimal methods of presenting information, and in
              the design of the next generation of computer vision systems and intelligent
              control systems.  This project is supported in part by the NSF Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical & Physical
              Sciences.
