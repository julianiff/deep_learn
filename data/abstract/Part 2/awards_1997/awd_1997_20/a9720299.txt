Abstract    :
              Shaw/Abstract            The purpose of this research is the intercomparison of
              three and  possibly four  new  inst4ruments designed to measure Cloud
              Condensation  Nuclei (CCN).            Since each device employs a different
              means to obtain the same  result, it is essential to evaluate their relative
              merit experimentally.  The  tests will be performed at the Geophysical
              Institute, Fairbanks within the  next few months.
