Abstract    :
              This project is being funded through the Learning and Intelligent Systems (LIS)
              Initiative.  The focus is on learning as it occurs in complex environments,
              where the data have rich and potentially confusing structures.  Nine
              investigators in five different disciplines - biology, chemistry, linguistics,
              psychology, and high school teaching of mathematics and science - will mount a
              collaborative, multi-level experimental and theoretical analysis of the mind's
              learning structures.  The work integrates research on formal analyses of
              learnability, the evolution of complex natural and artificial adapative
              systems, the genetics of memory, the mind's ability to keep track of language
              learning data, perceptual learning of complex displays like equations and
              molecular models, and the creation of integrative math and science modules for
              use with interactive learning technologies.  The unifying theme running through
              all of the projects, and across every level of analysis, is the interaction
              between the structure of the brain's learning mechanisms, and the structure of
              the data that support learning.  Two related leitmotives cut across the planned
              work.  First, the project itself is conceived of as a complex,
              interdisciplinary learning environment for people ranging from high school
              students and science teachers in the Los Angeles community, to senior faculty
              at UCLA.  Second, the research efforts interact with and inform advancements in
              the rapidly evolving technologies for learning, instruction, genetic screening,
              and the development of artificial systems.
