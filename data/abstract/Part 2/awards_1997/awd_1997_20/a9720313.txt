Abstract    :
              This project is being funded through the Learning and Intelligent Systems (LIS)
              Initiative.  A group of nine senior investigators will study spatial
              competence, and its emergence over time, at the cognitive, computational, and
              neural levels.  Topics to be studied include how people form spatial
              representations; how people communicate about spatial information using
              external symbol systems such as maps, diagrams, graphs, and linguistic
              descriptions; the role of the educational input received in American schools in
              supporting spatial learning; the optimal computational model of spatial
              learning; and, evidence of neural plasticity for spatial learning, based on
              both neuroanatomical study and neuropsychological evaluation.  The common
              purpose of this group of related research endeavors is to examine the nature of
              environmentally-sensitive growth in spatial competence and how spatial learning
              can be maximized in the American population.  Innovations for educational
              practice and educational software resulting from our research will be evaluated
              with the help of collaborating teachers.
