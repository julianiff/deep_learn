Abstract    :
              This project is being funded through the Learning & Intelligent Systems
              Initiative, and is supported in part by the NSF Office of Multidisciplinary
              Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences. Learning in
              many cognitive domains, including language and vision, involves recognition of
              complex hierarchical structure that is hidden or only indirectly reflected in
              the input data.  In this project a multi-disciplinary group of applied
              mathematicians, cognitive scientists, computer scientists, linguists, and
              neuroscientists will study the learning of compositional structure in language,
              vision, and planning, and will also probe the neural mechanisms for identifying
              and exploiting such structure.  The research involves three interacting lines
              of work.  The first refines and extends statistical learning models; the second
              applies these models to language, vision, and planning; and the third develops
              and applies new experimental and analysis techniques for probing the neural
              mechanisms that learn and exploit compositional structure.  The results of the
              project should significantly increase our understanding of complex learning,
              and should have implications for a wide range of topics in education (e.g.,
              learning of complex knowledge structures in science and math) and technology
              (e.g., automated speech recognition, computer vision, robotics).
