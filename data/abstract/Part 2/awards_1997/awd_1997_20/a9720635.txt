Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry   program
              supports research in the laboratories of Professor Jean'ne   Shreeve at the
              University of Idaho.  Shreeve has proposed to develop a   new class of per- and
              poly-fluoroalkyl electrophilic transfer agents   based upon simple inorganic
              molecules.  The proposal clearly outlines a   variety of synthetic routes for
              the preparation of these reagents.    Although a variety of perfluoroalkyl
              transfer agents are known, these   reagents often require the use of tedious
              synthetic methodologies or   possess a limited scope of applicability. The new
              reagents to be   developed are expected to offer the advantages of being
              applicable to the   derivatization of a variety of template molecules and being
              stable in the   presence of nucleophiles and under photolytic conditions. 
              Additional   studies will include the nucleophilic transfer of per- and  
              poly-fluoroalkyl groups from the corresponding per- and   poly-fluoroalkylated
              silanes.  The incorporation of fluorine or fluorine-containing groups into  
              molecules has a marked effect upon the chemical and physical properties   of
              the parent molecule.  These changes result in increased lipophilicity   and
              improved hydrolytic and thermal stability.  As a result, the demand   for such
              compounds by the pharmaceutical, medical and polymer industries   continues to
              grow.  The reagents developed in this program are expected   to result in the
              more efficacious and economical production of   fluorine-containing compounds.
