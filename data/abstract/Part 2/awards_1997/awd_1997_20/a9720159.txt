Abstract    :
                      9720159  NIEBAUM  This award provides funding for computer network
              equipment and  services to establish the Great Plains Network (GPN), a north- 
              south communications corridor linking scientists in six central  EPSCoR states.
               North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas,  Oklahoma, and Arkansas have
              formed an alliance, with each  participating state committing non-federal
              matching funds to help  establish the GPN as a regional virtual community and
              provide  researchers in those states with access to high-bandwidth  networks
              and high performance computing capacity.  This important  research
              infrastructure will enhance research in a breadth of  basic and applied areas
              but the initial focus of the GPN is on a  central theme of Earth System
              Science.  The network is expected  to foster collaborations among researchers
              in the central plains  states and lead to recognition of this virtual community
              as a  center-of-excellence in spatial data analysis technologies  applied to
              the biospheric sciences.  The GNP will be governed by   an Advisory Committee
              of nationally recognized experts who will  provide guidance for the three
              functional teams - a Management  Team, a Technical Team, and an Earth System
              Science Team.  A  conference of the members of the Earth System Science Team
              and  other invitees is planned for 5-7 November 1997 at the EROS Data   Center,
              a U.S. Geological Survey facility in South Dakota.
