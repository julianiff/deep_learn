Abstract    :
              Oil recovery from heterogeneous porous media is a challenging problem. The
              current trend in reducing the cost of oil recovery is toward integrated
              large-scale reservoir modeling whereby fine-detailed geologic models (10
              million grid-blocks) and coarse reservoir models (of order of 100,000
              grid-blocks) are used to solve complex multiphase flow equations, understand
              reservoir flow mechanisms and design techniques to improve oil and gas
              recovery; and (d) predict future reservoir performance. This research project
              is a multidisciplinary effort by computer scientists and engineers to develop
              new and novel ways of tapping the ever increasing capabilities of parallel
              computers to develop a better understanding of multiphase, multi-component
              fluid flow in porous media. The objectives of this research project are (1) to
              develop algorithms for loop optimization and data partitioning/clustering for
              MPP applications; (2) to develop parallel programming tools for specific
              implementation of the data and computations distribution algorithms on the CRAY
              T3E; and (3) to evaluate performance of parallel algorithms in solving a large
              scale reservoir problem.
