Abstract    :
              9720377  Reiser    In this 36 month project, the PIs develop an Instructional
              model of reflective inquiry, including a description of the cognitive
              strategies that comprise reflective activity in scientific inquire and
              principles for their instruction. The project also develops software and
              curriculum that will enable the investigation and evaluation of this
              instructional model in real-world classrooms. The instructional model accounts
              for the following elements: cognitive strategies for reflection, strategic
              timing and initiation of strategy use, and beliefs that support reflection. It
              provides a framework for designing supports for reflection through social
              structures, tools, and artifacts. The model is used to guide the design of an
              inquiry-support environment called the Progress Portfolio, which will work in
              conjunction with third-party investigation software. The Progress Portfolio
              provides support for reflection by giving students mechanisms for turning their
              work products and processes into explicit objects for reflection. Ongoing
              empirical studies with the software and curriculum will lead to improvements in
              the design of the software and curriculum and refinement of the instructional
              model.
