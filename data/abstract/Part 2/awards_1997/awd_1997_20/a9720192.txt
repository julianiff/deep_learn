Abstract    :
              This project will investigate scalable parallel algorithms for the solution of
              light transport balance equations for environments composed of complex surface
              geometry. Although Monte Carlo methods can solve such balance equations when
              the input geometry is complex (e.g., 100 million surfaces), their convergence
              is slow. To overcome this limitation, finite element algorithms will be used to
              roughly characterize the light flow in the environment, and this large-scale
              information will be used to guide the sampling strategies of the Monte Carlo
              algorithms. Because designers of optical systems typically know where the large
              energy flow occurs in their systems, a 3D computer graphics steering front-end
              will be used to help guide both the subdivision in the finite element phase,
              and the sampling strategies of the Monte Carlo phase. Although the research
              being conducted attempts to improve solutions to the light transport problem,
              the systematic combination of the strengths of deterministic, Monte Carlo, and
              human-assisted methods could have applications in many high-dimensional
              problems where Monte Carlo methods are typically used.
