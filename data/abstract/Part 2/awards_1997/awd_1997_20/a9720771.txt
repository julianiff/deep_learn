Abstract    :
                  Frank, Juhan  AST-9720771    Dr. Frank will investigate the effects
              irradiation from an accretion disk has on the evolution in semi-detached binary
              systems containing compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars or
              black holes.  Irradiation, combined with systematic angular momentum losses,
              drives limit cycles in the evolution of the system, which Dr. Frank will
              investigate by numerical simulations under a variety of assumptions.  His main
              goals include determining if the observed dispersion in mass transfer rates and
              the relative distribution of cataclysmic variable subtypes can be explained by
              the irradiation-driven cycles, and then extending this work to the cases of
              systems involving neutron stars and black holes.
