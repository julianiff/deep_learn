Abstract    :
              9720334  Krishnaprasad  The goal of this research project is to investigate time
              coding in the central nervous system, specifically the auditory system of the
              barn owl, the early development of such codes, the learning of associated maps,
              and the exploitation of such sound codes and maps in source localization and
              sound separation.  The approach consists of electrophysiological and anatomical
              study, coupled with mathematical modeling of neural circuitry, the rigorous
              investigation of the structure and performance of relevant learning algorithms
              and the creation of an experimental robotic testbed.  This testbed, a binaural
              head, is intended to be capable of orienting itself to sound sources in complex
              acoustic environments through pure auditory servoing, by utilizing the
              development of control architectures capable of learning maps of the auditory
              space of the robot, and drawing upon an evolving understanding of barn owl
              auditory system.  The results of this research will provide insights into the
              design of novel roles for auditory sensing, interpretation and discrimination
              in autonomous robotic systems.  This research could lead to applications in
              hands-free human-machine communications in acoustically cluttered environments
              and in monitoring complex environments such as highly automated manufacturing
              plants.
