Abstract    :
              This project is being funded through the Learning and Intelligent Systems (LIS)
              Initiative, and will focus on the key role played by time in the organization
              and understanding of spoken language.  Statistical properties of spoken
              language will be computed and analyzed. The resultant data will be used to
              develop a computational model of speech processing based on syllable units and
              principles of temporal binding.  The data and modeling will guide the design of
              physiological experiments probing the neurological basis of spoken language
              understanding. These experiments will focus on the integration of phonetic and
              syllabic information into sequences of higher level linguistic units, and will
              involve recordings of single-unit and population responses in the auditory
              cortex of the brain. Perceptual experiments will also be conducted to delineate
              changes in the representations of linguistic information during learning of
              spoken language material.  The statistical, perceptual, and physiological data
              derived from this project will provide the foundation for a computational model
              of how listeners proceed from `sound` (the acoustics of speech) to `meaning`
              (the interpretation of lexical, syntactic, and semantic information). The model
              promises to have important consequences for theories of learning and language,
              and will influence various scientific domains pertaining to human
              communication, including automatic speech recognition, communication disorders,
              linguistics, developmental psycholinguistics, computational neuroscience and
              cognitive psychology.
