Abstract    :
              The grant supports research in the design and analysis of  algorithms and
              improving the education infrastructure at the  PI's department.  The research
              focuses primarily on the  following areas:  (i) fast approximation algorithms
              for  intractable (NP-hard) problems; (ii) fast approximation  algorithms for
              very large problems requiring nearly linear-  time solutions; (iii) competitive
              analysis of on-line  caching problems.  The style of research emphasizes the 
              following:  (i) general techniques for understanding,  unifying, and
              simplifying large classes of algorithms; (ii)  theoretical measures that are
              more realistic than either the  standard worst-case or average-case models;
              (iii) empirical  studies of new algorithms demonstrating their effectiveness. 
              The education plan consists of the following.  (i)  Developing a training
              course for a core group of advanced  undergraduates who will them lead small
              weekly discussion  sections in the introductory courses.  (This will 
              simultaneously improve the introductory courses and provide  a training ground
              for students to become educators.)   (ii)  Working with an outside evaluator to
              extensively evaluate  the experience of majors and prospective majors.  Two 
              primary goals are to determine the effects of the  aforementioned discussion
              sections (both on the students in  the sections and those leading them), and to
              identify  reasons for the low rate of retention of women  undergraduates by the
              department.
