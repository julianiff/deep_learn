Abstract    :
                9720485 Haegel  The goal of this project is to combine microanalysis optical
              and electrical techniques with specially designed planar contact structures to
              image transport near contacts and on small semiconductor structures.
              Quantitative electron beam induced current (EBIC) and cathodoluminescence (CL)
              measurements will be made in a scanning electron microscope. These measurements
              are expected to reflect spatial distributions and changes under bias of local
              electric fields and carrier profiles near the contacts. %%% This is a research
              enhancement grant made under the Professional Opportunities for Women in
              Research and Education (POWRE) program. The research will contribute basic
              materials science knowledge at a fundamental level. An important feature of the
              program is the integration of research and education through undergraduate
              student participation in research. ***
