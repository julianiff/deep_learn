Abstract    :
                9720482 McKay  This theory project develops a position-space
              renormalization-group approach to study driven diffusive lattice gases; the
              theory will be modified and applied to interacting cases and systems with
              quenched randomness.  Systems driven far from equilibrium are prevalent in
              nature and particularly challenging with respect to fundamental understanding
              and property prediction. The models to be studied in this project are simple
              prototypes related to a variety of complex systems such as biological
              populations, binary fluid flow through random media, and fast ionic conductors.
              %%% This is a research enhancement grant made under the Professional
              Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program. The research
              will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level. An
              important feature of the program is the integration of research and education
              through undergraduate student participation in research. ***
