Abstract    :
              Significant advances in the primary scientific disciplines have blurred the
              boundaries between biology, chemistry, and physics.  During this visiting
              professorship, Dr. Carleton will build on her chemical and physical expertise
              by gaining new biological capabilities.  By acquiring college-level teaching
              experience and establishing an interdisciplinary research program, she will
              make the transition from industry to academia to work at this exciting
              scientific interface.    Dr. Carleton will develop a new course in introductory
              physics, teaching physical concepts entirely through biological examples.  The
              course will focus on physical concepts most relevant to understanding
              biological organisms and most likely to engage biology students.    Dr.
              Carleton also will carry out research on the visual system of cichlid fishes
              from Lake Malawi, Africa.  These fishes have undergone an extraordinarily rapid
              radiation, which is thought to have been driven by sexual selection.  While
              visual communication plays a key role in cichlid mate choice, little is known
              about the spectral characteristics of the visual signals (male color patterns)
              or their reception (female visual spectral sensitivities).  The goals of the
              research are to interrelate the visual capabilities, the color patterns, and
              the photic environment to assess what role mate choice has played in generating
              the spectacular diversity of cichlid fishes.
