Abstract    :
              This research is to investigate new electron beam generation for achieving a
              narrower electron energy distribution and low angular beam spread. When the
              irradiated film is electrically insulating, positive ion impingement results in
              secondary emission from the film surface, resulting in a net charge build up in
              the film.  However, when beam electrons impinge on the film surface, the
              resulting secondary electron emission actually aids in charge neutralization of
              the surface.   These two fundamental issues are of importance to the new beam
              curing process for low k polymer and glass films in these research activities. 
                 In ULSI fabrication the parasitic capacitance of multi-level interconnects
              now limits circuit speed.  If the relative dielectric constant (k) of
              interlevel dielectric films can be reduced below  3, this limitation can be
              overcome.
