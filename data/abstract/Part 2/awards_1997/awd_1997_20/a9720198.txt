Abstract    :
              The characterization of large computational applications from a systems
              perspective is critical to the design of future high performance systems that
              achieve good performance on this class of applications.  There is a growing
              acceptance of the fact that systems research needs to be driven by realistic
              applications. This small grant will enable the PIs to study the issues involved
              in developing an infrastructure for systems characterizations of applications.
