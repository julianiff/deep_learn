              ABSTRACT    OPP-9720144       MORITZ, RICHARD  UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON   
              MOORE, JAMES  UNIVERSITY COPERATION FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH    This project is
              a key component of a large, coordinated, multi-investigator program, Surface
              Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean.  The research program will be
              conducted for 14 months from a ship frozen into the ice pack.  The combined set
              of measurements in SHEBA will allow refinement of climate models for the Arctic
              region. Those improved models will lead to better predictions of the climate
              and the permanence of the Arctic ice cap under a proposed global warming that
              could occur if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are increased above present
              levels. This project will project a management office for SHEBA.  The office
              will facilitate a set of core measurements at the field site, coordinate
              investigator reporting/planning efforts, and provide information both to the
              general public and other funding agencies participating in joint research
              projects.
