Abstract    :
              This project studies the rapid change in fertility that has occurred in
              Bangladesh over the past 20 years.  The standard demographic theory of
              population decline says that people have fewer children when their economic
              situation improves. In this case the economic situation has not improved, yet
              the population has limited growth through the increasing use of contraceptives.
              This project will test hypotheses to explain variation in contraceptive use
              among rural, underprivileged  people near Dhaka, the capital city of
              Bangladesh.  The project will develop an instrument for assessing economic
              well-being that is more sensitive to local understandings of poverty and
              wealth.  Focusing on contrasts between couples who use contraceptives and those
              who do not, the project will employ a mix of qualitative ethnographic methods
              and quantitative data to provide a picture of local reproductive choice. On the
              theoretical level, it will be a model to advance the combination of ethnography
              and local contextual knowledge with extensive, statistically representative
              survey-based knowledge.  On a practical level, it will provide useful
              information to family planning policy development in Bangladesh, the world's
              most densely populated country.  The new knowledge from this project should be
              significant in light of the continuing global problem of overpopulation.
