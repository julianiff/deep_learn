Abstract    :
              9720623   R. A.  Mullen  University of  Washington     Optically Reconfigurable
              Antenna Synapses    Dr. Mullen will evaluate the feasibility of employing
              polymers in lieu of semiconductors in photoconductive microwave switches.  If
              successful, this work promises to increase the functionality of microwave
              antenna apertures.    This award will enhance the rf photonic program being
              established at the Univ. of Washington by the PI.  This research activity will
              be highly leveraged by the experience, knowledge, practical insights and rf
              photonic diagnostic facilities developed during the PI's 12 years of industrial
              experience.  It will significantly further the PI's career goals by nurturing
              nascent cross-disciplinary collaborations and by expending opportunities to
              publish scholarly articles and technical proposals necessary to attain an
              influential high-visibility position within the university tenure system.
