Abstract    :
              9720545  Ellis, Carla Schlatter  Duke University    POWRE: Visiting
              Professorship: Systems Research in Adaptation    This project supports the
              research and educational activities of the PI as a Visiting Professor at the
              University of Washington for the 1997-98 academic year.    The research
              investigates the role of adaptation in computer systems, particularly as it
              applies to resource management in clusters of workstations and environments for
              mobile computing. Adaptation is an emerging theme in systems research. At all
              levels of system design, there are potential performance benefits to be
              realized by responding to dynamic variations in runtime behavior and resource
              availability by applying distinctly different policies or techniques.    The
              defined research plan experimentally addresses questions concerning what the
              best adaptation strategies are and what infrastructure mechanisms are useful
              for their implementation.  The methods to be employed include design,
              implementation, and measurement of software prototypes to evaluate various
              adaptation approaches.  This award is expected to have impact on the discovery
              of new adaptation techniques to improve mobile and cluster computing
              performance, encouragement of women students to enter and to complete advanced
              degree programs in Computer Science, and advancement the PI as a senior woman
              in research and education.
