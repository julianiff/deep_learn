Abstract    :
              The widening disparity between computation and input/output rates is now a major
              impediment to achieving high performance for a wide range of national challenge
              applications. This is especially true for emerging multidisciplinary
              applications with dynamic, irregular behavior and time varying input/output
              demands. An extensive analysis of application and physical input/output
              patterns by multiple research groups has shown that no single parallel file
              policy is likely to yield high performance for all input/output patterns. 
              Instead, it will be necessary to aggressively exploit input/output access
              pattern knowledge in caching and prefetching  systems to obtain a substantial
              fraction of peak  hardware input/output performance.  This project will explore
              the research issues underlying creation of (a) automatic behavioral
              classification techniques to identify and group application resource request
              patterns, (b) flexible file system policies that can trade storage space for
              increased input/output bandwidth and balance conflicting resource demands
              within and across applications, and (c) a set of fuzzy logic decision
              mechanisms for selecting file system policies based on application input/output
              requests and input/output system responses.
