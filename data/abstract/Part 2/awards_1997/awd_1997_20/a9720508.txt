              9720508  Franklin, Judy A.  Mount Holyoke College    POWRE: Positive Human
              Machine Interaction through Music    This award supports an exploration into
              enabling machines to learn to interact with humans via music. Jazz
              improvisation is a domain for multi-scale on-line learning systems that
              requires continuous improvement of interactive performance during learning.
              Learning takes place at multiple levels and may have poorly defined, changing
              goal/critic functions. Yet the domain problems have straightforward numerical
              representations. It is a popular, deep source of human interaction.   
              Reinforcement learning (RL) is well suited. RL is easily used within a
              numerical context, within a hierarchical structure. A two-level structure is
              proposed. One RL node creates melody. A high level node learns to "mix" three
              melody sources: the first RL node, the melody from the human, and a third node
              that knows about jazz scales. Significantly, RL algorithms can use direct
              feedback (the improvisation fits rules of jazz) and "indirect" feedback (energy
              in the human's musical reply increases, human rates it highly, audience claps).
              The goals are to understand how to obtain reinforcement from a human, to
              facilitate improving human/machine discourse. Results are relevant to other
              kinds of discourse. The PI will start a strong research program and continue
              collaborations with cognitive scientists interested in how humans learn to
              improvise (in the jazz and more general sense).
