Abstract    :
              Abundant genetic variation in humans is widely distributed across the genome. 
              The project of reconstructing human population divergence is best served by
              those genetic markers differentiating populations.  The purpose of this study
              is to evaluate a large number of microsatellite markers in a sample of human
              populations for use in a Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP).  Microsatellite
              loci are regions of repeating DNA sequence.  They are utilized for many
              purposes, including the localization of human disease genes.  This study will
              produce three results pertinent to advancing HGDP goals: a description of the
              variation (heterozygosity and polymorphism) of several hundred genetic markers
              among five study populations, the relative informativeness of each marker for
              studying population divergence, and finally a methodological characterization
              of each marker for application in diverse laboratory settings. This enormous
              amount of genetic data will be generated with new methods involving automated
              typing technology and a novel strategy using pooled DNA samples.
