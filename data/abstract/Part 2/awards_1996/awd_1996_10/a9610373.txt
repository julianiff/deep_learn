Abstract    :
              9610373    Funds were requested for the purchase of a digital camera  and lens,
              frame  grabber board and a pentium personal computer.  The purpose  of this 
              equipment is to record internal deformations of planar  specimens of earthen 
              materials by means of image analysis.  These internal  deformations are then 
              processed using regression analysis techniques to compute  strain  components. 
              The equipment will become part of the  geotechnical engineering  research
              laboratory at Northwestern University.  The  equipment will be used  in
              on-going research of post-peak response of soils, and to  study  deformation
              and fracture propagation of rock and grouted  sands.  ***
