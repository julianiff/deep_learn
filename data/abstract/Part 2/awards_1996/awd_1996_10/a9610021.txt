Abstract    :
                This proposal must be considered in relation to the developing  interagency
              National Space Weather Program which is proceeding from  the strategic plan
              phase to the implementation phase.  As discussed  in the proposal, however, the
              space weather requirements for the  commericial space community are not well
              defined.  In this project,  site visits to commercial space users will be
              utilized to determine  space weather impacts to specific systems and how space
              weather  nowcast and forecast products could be utilized by their operations 
              to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  Data collected during  these visits
              will be utilized to determine customer needs for space  weather bulletins,
              alerts, warnings, and forecasts.  The analysis  will include a cost saving/cost
              avoidance trade-off study to  establish the relevance of space weather services
              to the  commericial sector.
