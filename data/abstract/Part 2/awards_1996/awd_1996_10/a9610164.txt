Abstract    :
                 This research of Professors Harry B. Gray and Jay R. Winkler of the  
              California Institute of Technology is funded by the Inorganic,   Bioinorganic
              and Organometallic Chemistry Program.  The research is aimed   at probing the
              role of electron tunneling (super exchange) in long range   electron transfer
              through materials such as proteins.  Electron transfer   of this type is
              extremely sensitive to the difference in energy between   the bridge and those
              of the donor and acceptor.  Biphenylene bridges will   be used to link two
              metal ions and the effects of tunneling energy   through a common set of
              bridging ligands will be determined by varying   both the electron donor and
              acceptor metal ions.           Electron-transfer reactions are the simplest of
              chemical   transformations in that no bonds are formed or broken as the
              electron   migrates from the donor to the acceptor.   When the redox partners
              are   separated by long distances, the rate of electron transfer is mediated by
                the intervening medium.  This research will study the effects of energy  
              differences between electronic states in the bridge and those of the   donor
              and acceptor metal ions.
