Abstract    :
                This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry
              Program, focuses on the development of sequence-specific  analyses of large DNA
              molecules using single molecule detection.   Professor Nie and his students at
              Indiana University will use  sequence specific DNA-binding proteins that have
              been modified with  fluorescent tags so that their binding to DNA can be
              detected.  The  specific sequence sites at which this binding occurs will be 
              quantified using an integrated laser-induced fluorescence and  tapping-mode
              atomic force microscope that has been developed in the  Professor Nie s
              laboratory.  This work will benefit several areas  including the use of DNA
              diagnostics, gene mapping, and fundamental  studies of DNA replication,
              transcription, and recombination.  This project will develop a highly sensitive
              and selective method  for identifying DNA molecules that have specific
              sequences of  interest.  Sequence specific DNA-binding proteins that have been 
              tagged with a fluorescent group will be detected using a new laser-  induced
              detector combined with an atomic force microscope.  This  work will have impact
              on several areas of molecular genetics and  DNA analyses.
