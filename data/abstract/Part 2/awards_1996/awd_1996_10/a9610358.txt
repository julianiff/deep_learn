Abstract    :
              Human intellectual capacity to manage complex design processes is continually 
              thwarted by advances in scale and variety of VLSI technologies, increasing 
              sophistication of synthesis and verification tools, and escalating
              time-to-market  pressures. This research focuses on reasoning support tools for
              decomposing  high-level system specifications into synthesizable components.
              The underlying  format is rigorous enough to support, and in some cases
              supplant, formal  verification tasks. Human interaction centers on a novel
              tabular notation  developed by the PI, whose synchronous semantics matches the
              intended models in  high level synthesis.  Resulting software includes a system
              for animating  behavior tables and mapping them to existing synthesis
              languages, a graphical  interface for interactively building and manipulating
              behavior tables, and an  integrated formal system for transforming and
              reasoning about them. These  components can be used individually or in
              combination. The software is widely and  freely distributed and is part of a
              repository of Scheme-based modeling tools.
