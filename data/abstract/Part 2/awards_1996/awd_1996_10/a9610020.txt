Abstract    :
              The investigator will apply theoretical procedures to the quantitative
              prediction of cross sections for Rayleigh and Raman scattering of ultraviolet
              radiation in molecular oxygen, and used to explore the influence of scattering
              on the transmission and attenuation of solar ultraviolet radiation in the
              atmosphere.  He will calculate the cross sections and insert them into the
              collision kernel of the Boltzmann equation to study the effects of vibrational
              excitation in the slowing of energetic nitrogen atoms and production of
              rotationally and vibrationally excited NO.  He will apply quantal and
              semi-classical procedures to determine the rate coefficients for energy
              transfer in collisions involving vibrationally excited molecules.  Finally, he
              will quantitatively assess the contribution of radiation involved in the
              collision of metastable oxygen molecules to the continuum emission present in
              the night airglow.
