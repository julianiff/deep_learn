Abstract    :
              9610022  Grigoriu  A new method for analysis of solid mechanics problems, 
              termed the Random Walk Method (RWM), is developed.  This  method is a local
              method in that it provides the response at  a discrete location without having
              to solve the governing  equations over the entire domain.  The response at a 
              discrete location is then extracted from this field  solution.  The advantages
              of the method lie in that it is  simple to use, always stable, accurate, and
              ideal for  parallel computations.  The method is applicable to both 
              deterministic problems as well as problems with random  material properties,
              boundaries, and boundary conditions.  ***
