Abstract    :
              Cutkosky  9610132    The principal investigator will continue a study of local
              factorization of mappings.  The investigator has recently proven that
              factorization of birational maps along a valuation is possible in dimension
              three and characteristic zero by constructing a triangle of monoidal transforms
              with nonsingular centers.  In general, it is necessary that both rings be
              blownup.  Some new directions which the principal investigator is pursuing are:
              (1) Find a more "canonical" algorithm, which will patch to a global
              factorization by monoidal transforms; (2) Extend the result to positive
              characteristic; (3) Find a local result valid in all dimensions.  He is also
              continuing research on equivalence and finite determinancy of mappings, and on
              Cohen-Macaulay coordinate rings.    This is research in the field of algebraic
              geometry.  Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics,
              but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. 
              In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the
              simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field makes use of
              methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely
              is finding application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical
              computer science, and robotics.
