Abstract    :
              Dr. Darryl D. DesMarteau, III, Department of Chemistry, Clemson   University, is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Program of the
              Chemistry Division for research into the   reactivity, properties, and
              materials based on sulfonimides.     Perfluorinated ionomers (ion clustering
              polymers) and perfluorinated   ionenes (polyelectrolytes containing ionic
              groups  in  a  polymer  main    chain) incorporating  the  superacid
              bis((perfluoroalkyl)sulfonyl)imide   and isoelectronic sulfone functions will
              be prepared. Stable N-fluoro   derivatives will then be obtained by the
              reaction of the ionomers with   elemental fluorine. These polymers will contain
              ionic clusters embedded   in a fluorcarbon matrix and the cavities, where the
              clusters reside, will   be used as microreactors to form dispersed nanoscale
              particles of, for   example, CdSe. Using analogies to molecular sulfonimides,
              the polymers   will be developed as acid catalysts. Also based on analogy to
              the   sulfonimides, fluoroalkyl iodonium salts will be developed as aqueous  
              phase alkylating reagents. Using these reagents fluoroalkyl analogs of   amino
              acids and other biochemically interesting compounds will be   prepared.  The
              systems to be studied in this project are being investigated for   their
              potential as polymer electrolytes in fuel cells and battery   applications, as
              media in which nanoscale materials can be formed, and as   polymer based
              reagents. One objective is the design of new catalysts for   a number of `acid
              catalyzed` processes (petroleum refining, for example,   often uses acidic
              catalysts). Another is to design ways to introduce   fluorine containing groups
              into biological molecules.
