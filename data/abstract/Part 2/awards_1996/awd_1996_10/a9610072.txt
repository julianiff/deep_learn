Abstract    :
                  This proposal will continue the operation of and data processing  for the
              magnetometer array across northern Canada namedMACCS  (Magnetometer Array for
              Cusp and Cleft Studies).  The array is  jointly operated by Augsburg College
              and Boston University, with  Augsburg taking responsibility for the four
              stations in the western  half of the array. Scientific analysis of the data
              from the array  is foucused on waves, currents and plasma flows associated with
              the  cusp and cleft regions.  Specific investigations will proposed  include:
              determination of the source (cusp or mantle) of the  broadband Pc 1-2 waves
              observed at very high latitudes using  combined satellite and ground data;
              determine the source and  generation mechanism for broadband Pc 3-4 waves;
              investigate SC  events using very high latitude magnetometer data to further 
              elucidate the global morphology of these events.
