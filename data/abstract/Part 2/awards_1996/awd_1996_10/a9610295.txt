Abstract    :
              This projects seeks efficient algorithms for learning  complex concepts from
              examples and other kinds of  information.  A major focus on the "other kinds of
               information" that may serve to reduce the computational  difficulty of
              learning complex concepts, including queries  to a teacher, advantageous order
              of presentation of  examples, the presence of related concepts, and constraits 
              imposed by real-world situations (e.g., robot navigation,  language learning). 
              New models of interaction between a  teacher and a learner will be developed
              and explored.  Techniques from computational complexity, the theory of 
              automata and formal languages, the analysis of algorithms,  and cryptography
              will be used to define and explore models  of efficient learnability.
