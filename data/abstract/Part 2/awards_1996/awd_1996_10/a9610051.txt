Abstract    :
              9610051  Rood     The primary objective of this project is to provide reliable
              experimental and modeled results describing the ambient aerosols' light
              scattering properties and composition.  This project is part of the North
              Atlantic Regional Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-2) which will be
              conducted in June and July, 1997, over the subtropical Northeastern Atlantic
              Ocean as an international collaborative effort. The main objectives of ACE-2
              are to study the properties of atmospheric aerosols relevant to radiative
              forcing and climate using aircraft, ship-board, and ground-based measurements. 
               Measurements will be performed with in-situ rapid response aerosol sampling
              instrumentation for a six-week period at a ground-based station at Sagres,
              Portugal. Aerosol light scattering properties will be obtained with controlled
              relative humidity nephelometry performed by University of Illinois personnel.
              Aerosol particle composition, aerosol particle size distribution, and
              hygroscopic growth measurements will be performed by collaborators from the
              Desert Research Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, and Institute of
              Tropospheric Research, Leipzig. Further analyses of the in-situ particle
              measurements and aerosol composition will be performed with recently developed
              thermodynamic models in collaboration with Dr. C. Pilinis, University of Miami.
              Measurements and models will be integrated to describe the ambient aerosol's
              light scattering coefficients and their dependence on controlled relative
              humidity, wavelength of light, direction of light scattered, and particle
              composition.
