Abstract    :
              9610306  Case    An important issue in conservation biology is how native
              species respond to disturbance and invasions by exotic species.  Since the
              invasion of California by the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) nearly 100
              years ago, many studies have addressed the impact of  L. humile on the native
              ant community.  However, the implications of such a change on the rest of the
              community have still not been examined.  Preliminary work has shown that the
              Argentine ant is extremely abundant in upland scrub habitats (coastal sage
              scrub and chamise-chaparral) in coastal southern California.  The coastal
              horned lizard, an ant specialist and sensitive species for the state of
              California, was absent from the small fragments surveyed and only found in
              areas without the Argentine ant in larger unfragmented areas.    This research
              will consist of a series of experiments to determine which factors facilitate
              the invasion of the Argentine ant in to natural habitats and measure the impact
              of the invasion on various trophic levels throughout the community. 
              Specifically, the investigator will test the hypotheses that 1) habitat
              modification facilitates the invasion of an exotic species, 2) the Argentine
              ant through exploitation and interference competition affects not only other
              arthropods, but vertebrates as well and 3) the native ant community will return
              to a pre-invasion state with the thorough removal of Argentine ants.  These
              studies will provide information for the control of this exotic pest as well as
              help determine management guidelines for the preservation of sensitive habitat
              and species therein.
