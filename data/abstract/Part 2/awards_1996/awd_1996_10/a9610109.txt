Abstract    :
                                                This award from the Chemistry Research
              Instrumentation and Facilities Program will assist the  Department of Chemistry
              at  University of Michigan to acquire a Siemens SMART/CCD system  for
              collecting X-ray diffraction data. This equipment will enhance research in a
              number of areas  including the following: (1) new olefin polymerization 
              catalysts based on boratabenzene  zirconium derivatives, (2) synthetic analogs
              for the FE/Mo/S site in nitrogenase, (3) bimetallic  clusters and HDS
              catalysis, (4) extended networks based on supramolecular bonding, and (5) the 
              coordination chemistry of manganese.      The X-ray diffractometer is used to
              make accurate and precise measurements of the full three  dimensional structure
              of a molecule. The information obtained gives the precise values of all the 
              bond distances and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate
              information about the  spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the
              neighboring molecules.
