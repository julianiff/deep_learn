Abstract    :
              The insertion of mobile elements into the genome represents a new class of
              nuclear markers for the study of human genomic diversity.  The Alu family of
              mobile elements comprise 5% of the human genome.  Most members of the recently
              integrated Alu subfamilies are restricted to the human genome and absent from
              nonhuman primates.  Many of these repeat units have inserted so recently within
              the human genome that they are polymorphic for the presence or absence of an
              Alu element at a particular chromosomal location.  Alu insertion polymorphisms
              offer two important advantages over other nuclear based polymorphisms for human
              evolution studies.  First, the presence of an Alu element represents identity
              by descent, since the probability that two different young Alu repeats would
              integrate independently in the same chromosomal location is negligible. 
              Second, the ancestral state of each Alu insertion polymorphism is known to be
              the absence of the element, which can be used to root trees of population
              relationships.  In this project we will determine the human genomic diversity
              associated with several polymorphic Alu elements and develop haplotyping
              systems composed of polymorphic Alu insertions and adjacent microsatellite
              loci. Using both Alu repeats and microsatellites in each haplotype results in
              the combination of an identical by descent (Alu insertion) marker, with a class
              of marker that has a high mutation rate (microsatellites) providing a genomic
              memory for both early radiations of humans as well as recent evolutionary
              history.
