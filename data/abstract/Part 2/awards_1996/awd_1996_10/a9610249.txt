Abstract    :
              This research seeks to achieve a deeper understanding of the  critical computer
              vision components and techniques needed to  develop  a  new generation of image
              guided surgery  systems.  Such  systems  are important to the successful  use 
              of  the  emerging  class  of minimally invasive surgical  procedures. 
              Effective use of image guidance will improve the accuracy of  such procedures,
              broaden the range of applicable procedures,  and enable interactive
              patient-specific anatomical modeling.  The   key  computer  vision  issues  to 
              be  addressed   are  segmentation,  data  registration, instrument  tracking 
              and  flexible modeling of structures.  This research will develop  methods  for
              utilizing anatomical atlases and other anatomic  knowledge,   to   provide 
              structure-specific   segmentation  templates.  Such atlases will need to be
              registered  to  the  patient's  data set, requiring new registration 
              algorithms,  that   deal with flexible and deformable structures.  Motion 
              tracking  algorithms are needed to monitor the  position  of  surgical  
              instruments  within  the  operating  field.    By  utilizing  Mutual
              Information based registration algorithms,  this  proposal  will  develop
              tracking  methods  that  match  models  of the surgical instruments to passive
              views of  the  operating  field, enabling 3D tracking of those instruments. 
              Finally,  the  tracked position of the surgical instruments,  coupled  with
              detected variations in images of the  surgical  field itself, the 3D models of
              the patient's anatomy will be  automatically  updated  to reflect  removal  of 
              tissue  and  changes in position of anatomical structures.
