Abstract    :
                                      ABSTRACT       The principal investigators propose to
              conduct a series of experiments to study heat transfer and fluid flow in
              channels that are of micrometer dimensions.  Micro channels will be fabricated
              at the Center for Thin Film and Interface Research located at the principal
              investigators' institution.  Microscale pressure and temperature sensors that
              are required for the experiments will be also be fabricated by the same
              facility.  Various gases will be used in the study.  The experiments are
              designed to determine the effects of surface roughness, channel geometry, and
              rarefication on the friction factor and heat transfer performance.
