Abstract    :
                    9610536  Cuitino  Semiconductor devises, such as static and dynamic random
              access  memory, use thin metal interconnect lines.  Future devices are 
              anticipated to use even thinner interconnects.  The effect of  microstructural
              features, such as grain misorientation, grain size  distribution, grain
              morphology, size and morphology of  microdefects, as well as of other factors
              including, deposition  temperature, usage temperature, electric current
              density, on  nucleation and growth of voids in narrow interconnects is studies.
                crystal creep theory based on dislocation mechanics is employed as  the
              central tool for this investigation.  The study will also be  applicable in
              other areas such as the design and fabrication of  single crystal propellers,
              turbine blades, etc.  ***
