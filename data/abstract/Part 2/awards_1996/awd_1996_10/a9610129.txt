Abstract    :
              This starter grant award to the University of Central Florida supports the
              research of Professor Cherie  L. Geiger.  Within the field of environmental
              chemistry, the work focusses on the interactions and  byproducts of
              agricultural chemicals.  The objective is to understand the mechanism of
              degradation of  five commonly used agricultural chemicals under conditions
              found in a central Florida nursery and to  determine the chemical interactions
              of these five agrochemicals and their breakdown products. Foliage  and soil
              samples will be analyzed using high performance liquid chromotography and gas
              chromatography  using both a mass spectrometer and a photo
              ionization-electrolytic conductivity detector.    Findings from this research
              underpin further longterm study of the transport and fate of agricultural 
              chemicals in the environment. Benefits include better protection against
              catastrophic crop loss for  nurseries in the foliage industry and a more
              comprehensive understanding of the dangers to human health  and environmental
              contamination.
