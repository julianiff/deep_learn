Abstract    :
                This Research in Undergraduate Institution project, supported  jointly by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the  Division of Chemistry and the
              Chemical Reaction Processes Program  of the Division of Chemical and Transport
              Systems, focusses on  the synthesis and characterization of molybdenum carbide
              and  nitride catalysts for hydrodesulfurization chemistry.  Synthesis  of these
              materials and promotion by Co and Ni, evaluation by  spectroscopic studies of
              adsorbed probe molecules such as CO and  NO, and determination of HDS activity
              for a number of model  feedstocks forms the range of studies being carried out
              by  Professor Bussell and his students at Western Washington  University.  This
              work introduces undergraduates and masters  degree students to state of the art
              research in heterogeneous  catalysis, and provides important new information
              about the  fundamentals of hydrodesulfurization catalysis on novel  bimetallic
              systems.  The removal of sulfur from crude oil and coal is an important 
              application of heterogeneous catalysis.  This  hydrodesulfurization chemistry
              is the focus of this research  project.  Novel molybdenum carbide and
              molybdenum nitride  catalysts are synthesized and characterized in this  work,
              and the effect of Co and Ni promoters on the activity of  these materials is
              evaluated.  This work provides fundamental  information for the design and
              preparation of important new  catalytic systems.
