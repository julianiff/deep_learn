Abstract    :
              9610176  Lewis  This is an award to support research on the potential of using 
              phytoremediation for removal of radon from soil surrounding  buildings as a
              step toward reducing the pollution of indoor air  from this radioactive gas. 
              The objectives of this project are to  determine the amount of radon that can
              be removed from soil by  vegetation and to develop a soil-plant-atmosphere
              radon transport  mathematical model that may provide additional insights into
              the  mass and diffusional transport of water-soluble gases by plant  vascular
              systems from soil to air.  This laboratory study  involves experimental
              simulation of the soil-plant-concrete  basement system typical of constructed
              buildings by physical  models placed inside plant growth chambers with
              controlled  temperature, light and relative humidity.  Quantitative 
              determination of radon relating to controlled variables will  provide the basis
              for development of the simulation model.    Results of this project are
              expected to provide insights into the  potential for reduction of radon levels
              in residences.  An  expected product is a determination as to whether a
              field-scale  investigation is warranted, a step that would be needed to 
              translate knowledge to be gained into procedures for engineering  and
              architectural design of new buildings and addressing radon  pollution of
              existing structures.  ***
