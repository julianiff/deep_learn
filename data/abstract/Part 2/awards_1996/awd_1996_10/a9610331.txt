Abstract    :
              9610331  Gray    The Boston Research Data Center is now in its third year of
              operation with 15 research projects underway or due to start soon.  Located at
              the Census Bureau's Boston regional office, the BRDC provides researchers in
              the Boston area with access to a variety of confidential Census datasets in a
              secure setting.  The data would otherwise be available only at Census Bureau
              offices in Maryland, which would severely limit the ability of Boston
              researchers to participate.  Most of the projects at the BRDC use plant-level
              Census data on manufacturing industries, linked in some cases to other Census
              datasets.  Several of the projects address environmental issues, using data
              from EPA and a Census survey on pollution abatement costs.  These researchers
              have formed an "environmental group", with regular meetings to pool information
              and discuss reassert strategies.  future research projects are likely in these
              areas, but one of the strengths of the BRDC is that it can provide access to a
              wide range of Census data.  BRDC projects have already examined agricultural
              sharecropping, the earned income tax credit, and human resource policies.  The
              additional two years of support will provide the time necessary to implement a
              plan for permanent funding of the BRDC, combining institutional support from
              the Boston Federal Reserve with laboratory fees from supported research
              projects.        ??
