Abstract    :
              9610324  Williams    Organizations Concerned about Rural Education (OCRE) will
              identify exemplary community-based initiatives utilizing technology to enhance
              science and mathematics learning for students in rural areas. The project will
              contribute to contribute to community decisions by citing examples from rural
              America that showcase innovative collaborative efforts that will be featured in
              a national video conference in March 1997. Print and on-line information will
              complement the video conference materials. Project strategies include: a survey
              to identify initiatives, documentation on each selected by case study an
              inclusion in the video conference on-site and follow-up materials,
              dissemination via on-line, and features in OCRE's newsletter and other
              publications. The project will describe common initiative features such as:
              innovative approaches for use of technology, components for professional
              development, scalability and replicability, attention instruction and content,
              implications for public policy, sensitivity to resource constraints of rural
              communities, and commitment and active participation of community leaders.  ***
