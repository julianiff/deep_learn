Abstract    :
                 This project will provide funds for the partial support of participants at a
              Gordon Research Conference on sea ice ecology, to be held in Ventura,
              California, in March 1997.   The amount requested from NSF will allow partial
              to full support of approximately 20 of the expected 135 participants. 
              Selection for support will be by application, based on need and contribution to
              the conference, and to establish a balance among established researchers,
              beginning researchers, and students who are actively engaged in the topical
              areas of the conference.   This conference on sea ice ecology is the first in
              an expected series of Gordon Research Conferences on the polar marine sciences.
               Gordon Research Conferences provide a framework designed to foster creative
              activities in science and to enhance productive interactions among the
              international scientific community through free and unfettered discussions on
              innovative frontier research.   Sea ice ecology is an interdisciplinary study
              concerning the interaction among geophysical, biological, oceanographic, and
              geochemical processes within the sea ice and the underlying water column. 
              Areas of particular emphasis are the influence of the sea ice and snow cover on
              biologically significant processes, the operation of the polar marine food web
              through the seasonal ice growth and decay, and the transfer and exchange
              processes of carbon, silica, and other biogenic minerals.
