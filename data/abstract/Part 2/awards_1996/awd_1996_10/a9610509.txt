Abstract    :
              9610509  Chow    The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at North
              Carolina State University will purchase the Fast Prototyping System for Motor
              Incipient Fault Detection equipment which will be dedicated to support research
              in engineering.  The equipment will be used for several research projects.  The
              main research project to be supported from  this equipment grant is:    A
              Neural/Fuzzy Approach for Motor Incipient Fault Detection.    There are also
              several research projects which can benefit from this research equipment grant.
               The equipment can provide actual data for the Fast Prototype Motor Simulation
              System project.  The IR camera will be used for research in image processing by
              adding an additional band to the multispectral images used in restoration work.
               Projects entitled Digital Color Camera Design and Nonlinear Processing of
              Color Images will benefit from the proposed equipment.    The College of
              Engineering and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at North
              Carolina State University have agreed to jointly provide  33%  of the total
              project cost as matching fund for this equipment grant                  A-t
