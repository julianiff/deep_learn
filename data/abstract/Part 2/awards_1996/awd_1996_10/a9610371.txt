Abstract    :
              This project seeks to explore three concrete legal and ethical issues concerning
              the study of human genetic diversity.   First, it will examine whether and how
              a population's desires concerning limitations on the uses of materials the
              population provides can be legally enforced.  It will do that by collecting and
              analyzing existing materials transfer agreements, database access agreements,
              and legal precedents. Second, it will analyze whether, under existing legal and
              ethical principles, a project studying human genetic diversity legally can and
              ethically should include genetic samples that were collected for other
              purposes.    Third, it will analyze the ethical and legal issues raised by this
              research in light of the laws and policies of other nations and international
              organizations, using the unique database of such laws and policies developed by
              the Centre de recherche en droit public at the Universite de Montreal.  As we
              learn more about the `reference` human genome, we will need to know more about
              the variations in that genome spread throughout our species, for medical and
              other reasons.  No large-scale, coordinated effort to study this human genetic
              diversity can be undertaken without a full understanding of the three areas
              that are the subjects of this application.
