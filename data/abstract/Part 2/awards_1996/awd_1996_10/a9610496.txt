Abstract    :
                  9610496  McCauley  This project will use the plant Silene alba as a model
              system to investigate how genetic factors influence the persistence of
              populations. Many species are distributed into numerous small local populations
              owing to the natural distribution of patches of favorable habitat, or due to
              human impact on the landscape. Small populations often face a high probability
              of extinction, and the persistence of the species at large may require that new
              populations be founded at a rate that offsets local extinctions. Since small or
              recently established populations often display the harmful effects of
              inbreeding, it is important to understand the genetic characteristics of newly
              formed populations.   This study will ask whether recently established
              populations are prone to the harmful effects of inbreeding such that inbreeding
              influences population persistence. It will also ask whether the movement of
              genes from population to population by pollen dispersal (gene flow) can offset
              the effects of inbreeding. Studies of both natural and experimental populations
              of S. alba will address these issues. Studies of natural populations will use
              genetic techniques to measure the rate at which new genes enter recently
              founded populations owing to pollen movement. They will also investigate
              whether plants formed by this gene flow are more vigorous than their neighbors.
              In other experiments artificial populations of S. alba will be created in order
              to investigate the interaction of gene flow by pollen and inbreeding under more
              controlled conditions. Taken together, the results of these studies should
              contribute to a more general understanding of how genetic and ecological
              factors interact to determine the probability that a species can persist in a
              given landscape.
