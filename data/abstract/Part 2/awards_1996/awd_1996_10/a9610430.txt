Abstract    :
               Berkeley  The focus of this research is the preparation of phenylenes employing
                 methodology in which transition metals are used to assemble highly  
              energetic alkyne precursors which are then oligomerized to produce   phenylenes
              with linear, angular, C3-symmetric, circular, bent and zigzag   topologies. 
              Structurally significant  discoveries have included benzene   rings `devoid of
              aromaticity` and the observation of strong curvature.    Access to spherical
              and planar hydrocarbons as well as materials such as   carbon nets and
              graphitic `onions` is potentially available through this   approach. With this
              renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is   supporting the research of
              Dr. K. Peter C. Vollhardt of the Department of   Chemistry at the University of
              California, Berkeley.  Professor Vollhardt   will focus his work on preparing a
              class of novel benzenoid hydrocarbons   known as phenylenes.  The phenylenes
              contain structures in which fused   cyclobutadienes alternate with benzene
              rings to afford systems that have   potential as organic molecular magnetic
              and/or conducting materials, and   serve as precursors to a plethora of other
              novel classes of highly   energetic compounds with novel topologies.
