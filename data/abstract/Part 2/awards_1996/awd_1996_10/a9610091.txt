Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT  PUERTO RICO DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION  (Bayamon Educational Region) 
              Urban Systemic Initiative Program  Planning Award  96-10091      The five
              educational districts serving the city of Bayamon, Puerto Rico, have joined
              together to propose a self-study  on the status of K-12 science and
              mathematics, and technology education (SMTE) for the purposes of designing a
              plan for the systemic reform of SMTE in the Ponce schools.    Bayamon has a
              total population of 48,594 children between the ages of 5-17, of which 77% live
              in poverty according to the U.S. Census.  The five educational districts in
              (Bayamon I-IV) serve a student population of over 33,453 in 66 schools.  These
              districts are part of the Puerto Rico Department of Education which is the
              central educational agency on the island comprising 100 districts with eight
              educational regions.  Over 809 teachers are providing instruction in science or
              mathematics in the five Bayamon districts.    The Planning grant will support
              the establishment of an ongoing system to monitor the quality of the city's
              science and mathematics program and the articulation of a coherent and
              comprehensive plan to transform science and mathematics to higher level
              learning opportunities for all students.  The effort will be carried out in
              collaboration with the central level programs of Science and Mathematics of the
              Department of Education, The Resource Center for Science and Engineering (RCSE)
              at the University of Puerto Rico, the city of Bayamon, community organizations
              and the private sector.  The Puerto Rico Statewide Systemic Initiative program
              will play a major collaborative role in supporting the planning activities, as
              well as other such as Dwight D. Eisenhower Programs, Title I, Puerto Rico
              Education 2000, and School to Work programs.
