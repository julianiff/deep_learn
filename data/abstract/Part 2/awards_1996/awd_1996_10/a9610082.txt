Abstract    :
              9610082  Wang, Jing  University of California,  Riverside    REU:  Micro-Robot
              Soccer Playing - A R&D Project for Undergraduate Students    This Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports 8 students per year
              in programs carried out during the summers, for three years.  The projects
              involve research and development aspects of micro-mobile robots, robots that
              can cooperate to "play" soccer against another robot team--an innovative
              research project promoted internationally by the IEEE Robotics and Automation
              Society.  A robot soccer game is played on a court of 140 cm X 90 cm by two
              teams of autonomous mobile robots, each of which must fit in a 7.5 cm cube.  A
              team consists of 3 to 5 robots.  Participants will work on micro-robot
              structures, computer vision systems, onboard-robot processing units and
              peripherals, local motion and sensing, inter-robot communication, computer
              simulation, and game strategies.  The program is designed to train students to
              become research-minded and to think independently while gaining technical and
              ethical experiences.  Students will be exposed to cutting edge research in
              various technical areas including robotics, artificial intelligence,
              distributed computing, real-time systems, and computer organization.
