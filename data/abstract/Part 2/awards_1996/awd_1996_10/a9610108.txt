Abstract    :
              This project is cooperative between the University of Michigan (Papaefthymiou) 
              and the University of Rochester (Friedman). It is exploring electronic design 
              automation methods for optimizing high performance, high complexity VLSI/ULSI 
              circuits. The focus is on retiming and clock scheduling, two complementary 
              circuit optimization strategies that have attracted significant attention. 
              Retiming is an architectural-level transformation method that speeds up a 
              synchronous digital design. Clock scheduling is a circuit-level optimization
              that  increases the operating speed of a digital design. The approach is to
              merge these  two methods into a single powerful optimization process that will
              handle  comprehensive delay models. Problems being investigated are: (1)
              Finding enhanced  circuit models that consider physical and electrical issues
              related to  submicrometer technologies; (2)Developing a theoretical yet
              practical framework  for simultaneous retiming and clock scheduling based on
              these physical &  electrical models; (3) Designing and evaluating
              polynomial-time approximation  algorithms for integrated retiming and clock
              scheduling. Software developed  during the project is being widely distributed.
