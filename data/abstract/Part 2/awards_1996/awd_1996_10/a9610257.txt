Abstract    :
              The principal investigator works on a broad spectrum of  problems in finite
              model theory, which is the subject that  studies first-order logic and its
              extensions on collections  of finite structures.  He seeks to discover
              necessary and  sufficient conditions under which logics with fixpoint 
              operators capture computational complexity classes on  collections of finite
              structures.  Moreover , he  investigates the comparative expressive power of
              extensions  of first-order logic on collections as finite structures of 
              asymptotic measure equal to one.  He also studies various  aspects of logics
              with fixed finite number of variables,  including algorithms for
              satisfiability, and asymptotic  probabilities of properties expressible in such
              logics.  Progress on these problems will strengthen the connections  between
              logic and computation, and enhance the interaction  between logic,
              computational complexity, and asymptotic  combinatorics.  In a different
              direction, He continues  working towards the development of a structural 
              approximation theory for combinatorial optimization within  the framework of
              integer programming. The objective of this  investigation is to identify large
              classes of NP  optimization problems possesing approximation algorithms  with
              performance guarantees.***
