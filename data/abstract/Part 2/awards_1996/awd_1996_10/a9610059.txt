Abstract    :
                Abstract  CTS-9610059  D.D. Joseph and G.S. Beaver  U. of Minnesota    This a
              Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award for
              collaborative research in the area of multiphase flow processes between the
              University of Minnesota and a group of oil companies (Dowell-Schlumberger,
              Intervep, STIM-Lab Consortium of 18 companies, and Syncrude Canada).  The main
              focus will be on experimental investigation of elementary particle or bubble
              interaction mechanisms in non-Newtonian fluids and their effects on the
              macroscopic flow pattern and rheological behavior.  Direct numerical simulation
              (DNS) techniques developed by the same group will be used to interpret and
              generalize the experimental results.  These methods will address fundamental
              two-phase flow phenomena in five applicative areas:  particle migration in
              shear flow of fracturing fluids and drilling muds, cutting transport,
              lubricated pipelines of concentrated oil in water emulsions, and  rheology and
              stability of concentrated emulsions.  The collaborating companies will provide
              considerable input in the project direction, research activities, and student
              support.    The project will provide a scientific foundation for the complex
              multiphase flow processes encountered in various technologies in oil industry,
              with application to production, processing and transport of hydrocarbons and
              hydrocarbon products.
