Abstract    :
              9610353  Levin  Human introductions of species outside their natural range are
              rapidly homogenizing the earth's biota, and are a major threat to biodiversity
              in terrestrial, aquatic and marine habitats. Although the potential impact of
              biological invasions on biodiversity has been recognized for decades, until
              recently, most research has focused on terrestrial or freshwater rather than
              marine habitats. Anthropogenic introductions of marine species are numerous and
              have had a dramatic impact in some locals. While much has been learned about
              introduced species over the last 15 years, generalizations relative to marine
              systems are elusive. This study will address the effects of introduced species
              on kelp bed communities in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. Specifically, this
              research will examine the interactive effects of herbivory and competition on
              the introduced alga Codium fragile and the native kelp community of the
              northwest Atlantic, the indirect effects of a bryozoan on kelps in these
              communities, and the impact of increasing Codium and decreasing kelp biomass on
              the demography of fishes and decapods that use seaweed beds as nursery
              habitats.   The kelp bed communities of New England shift between two alternate
              states: a species-rich community dominated by laminarian kelps, and a
              species-poor community dominated by sea urchins and crustose coralline algae.
              Recently, a new community consisting of a monoculture of the introduced green
              alga, Codium fragile tomentosoides, is now prevalent in the region. In addition
              the introduction of a bryozoan also appears to have severely impacted kelp bed
              communities. Using a series of multi-factor experiments and descriptive
              studies, this research will elucidate the causes of this shift in community
              structure, and therefore explain the mechanisms underlying the dramatic,
              human-induced loss of biodiversity in these kelp communities.
