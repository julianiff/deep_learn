Abstract    :
                                      ABSTRACT         This proposal deals with manufacturing
              of coated optical fibers at high draw speed (e.g. 20 m/s).  The quality of the
              fiber depends on the diameter and concentricity of the coating, coat layer
              continuity, smoothness, bubble inclusion, and uniformity.  These
              characteristics are in turn affected by heat transfer and fluid flow that occur
              during the coating process.  The Principal Investigators (PIs) propose a
              theoretical and experimental program to study the transport processes and
              determine the effects various operating parameters have on the aforementioned
              characteristics.  Numerical simulations that take into account non-Newtonian
              effects and variable properties will be carried out.  Experiments will be
              conducted using different coating applicator geometries, coating materials,
              draw speeds, and fiber materials.  The experimental results will be used in
              conjunction with the simulation results to establish the linkage between the
              operating parameters and the quality of the fiber.  Validation of the numerical
              model will also be performed.  The results from this study will be useful for
              the design and optimization of coating dies and applications under different
              conditions.
