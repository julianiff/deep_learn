Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Bruce Berne  of the Department of Chemistry of  Columbia   University will
              study  solvent effects on chemical dynamics in solution,   spectral line shapes
              and energy transport in classical and quantum many   body systems using
              theoretical and computational methods. New techniques   in Monte Carlo, Quantum
              Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics will be   developed.  In particular systems
              with long range forces will be studied   and multiple time scale techniques
              will be developed. One other highlight   of this research is the development of
              realistic polarizable force   fields.  The development and application of
              advanced computer simulation   techniques such as those of this project are of
              importance for the   understanding of the mechanism of solvation in simple
              ionic solutions as   well as for the mechanism of solvation and stabilization
              of   macromolecules of biological importance.
