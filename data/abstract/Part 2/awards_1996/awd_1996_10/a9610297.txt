Abstract    :
              9610297  Dempsey  The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at 
              Clarkson University will purchase an Advanced Servohydraulic  Test Instrument
              For In-Situ Ice Testing which will be  dedicated to support research in
              engineering.  The research  will be used for several research projects,
              including in  particular the constitutive behavior and fracture of single- 
              cum-multiple ice crystals, scaling laws for the fracture and  constitutive
              behavior of sea ice and structural composites,  and the time dependent creep
              and fracture of freshwater ice.  This advanced test instrument will have to be
              constructed by  the assembly and fabrication of specific components; it is  not
              possible to purchase an "off-the-shelf" in-situ ice  testing instrument with
              the capabilities required.  The  purpose is to test ice as it exists in nature
              -- with the  resident temperature, grain size, and density profiles, as  well
              as the varied grain orientations that occurs with the  growth of an ice
              sheet-at the warm (just a few degrees below  freezing) temperatures that are of
              practical interest in ice  engineering.  It is very difficult to test sea ice
              above -15  C, or freshwater ice above -8 C, in the conventional  laboratory
              setup because the ice is changing as a material.  Impurities on the grain
              boundaries are melting, brine  pockets are changing shape and migrating
              downward.  In  addition, from the viewpoint of an adequate specimen size,  the
              test specimen sizes that can be tested in the laboratory  have been shown to be
              sub-size. For this reason, there  exists an urgent, need for an advanced
              in-situ ice test  instrument at Clarkson University to augment the research 
              currently being carried out for several funded projects.  The test instrument
              will be used to test ice grown in a  specially designed 3 x 3 x l.2 m test
              basin.
