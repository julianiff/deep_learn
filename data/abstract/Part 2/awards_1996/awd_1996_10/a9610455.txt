Abstract    :
              Randomness and non-determinism are two basic "freedoms"  stretching the concept
              of deterministic computation.  While  the power of these extensions remains a
              deep mystery of  computing theory, some vague pattern is emerging in 
              relationships between them.  The pattern of similar  techniques instrumental
              for quite different results in this  area is even more interesting.  Ideas like
              multilinear and  low-degree multivariate polynomials and Fourier 
              transformation over low-periodic groups seem very  illuminating.  Related are
              classical results on error-  correcting codes or hashing.  Some other
              techniques such as  expander graphs are based on different mathematics but can 
              be used for the same ends.  The research is directed towards  further
              understanding of the power of randomness and non-  determinism with special
              attention to the role of  mathematical techniques. It employs mathematical
              techniques  such as the ones mentioned above.
