Abstract    :
                                                This award from the Chemistry Research
              Instrumentation and Facilities Program will assist the  Department of Chemistry
              at Occidental College to acquire a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This  equipment
              will enhance research in a number of areas including the following: (1)
              structure and  dynamics of biomembranes, (2) palladium-dependent approaches to
              optically pure carbocyclic  nucleosides, (3) an NMR investigation of the
              self-exchange rate of the Cua domain of thermus  thermophilus cytochrome ba and
              (4) studies on furocoumarin-DNA interactions.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
              (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown 
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
              state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying
              out frontier research. The results from  these NMR studies are useful in the
              areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
