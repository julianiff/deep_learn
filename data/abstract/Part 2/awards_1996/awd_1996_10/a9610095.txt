Abstract    :
                Abstract-Gupta     The structure of flames is examined under conditions of
              highly preheated air using     methane or propane as the fuel.  Specific
              matters of interest include flame stability limits,     flame signature, flame
              radiation and emission-adsorption spectra, flame temperature, and      chemical
              species within the flame as affected by air preheat temperature, fuel, and
              flame     equivalence ratio.  The experimental facility uses a pair of
              regenerative burners which     allow the test section to be maintained at any
              temperature up to 1800( K; combustion air     can be preheated up to 1300( K,
              giving a much higher air temperature than in     conventional furnaces.  The
              test section is optically  accessible permitting the use of a     number of
              optical diagnostics.      Highly-preheated air combustion offers many potential
              advantages but has not    been deemed practical up to now.  It can reduce fuel
              consumption up to 30%, reduce     carbon dioxide emissions, reduce equipment
              size, and reduce pollutants by 20-30% for a     given therm production.  The
              recirculating system used in this study may be a practical     way to exploit
              these benefits.
