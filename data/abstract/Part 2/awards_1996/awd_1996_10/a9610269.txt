Abstract    :
                  9610269  Montgomery  Shallow landslides repeatedly cause loss of life,
              injury, and  economic and environmental damage in the mountainous regions of 
              the country and the world.  Assessment of slope instability and  debris flow
              initiation is the topic of this project in which four  main issues will be
              addressed: (1) determining the input  parameters for use in physically based
              slope stability models:  (2) testing of predictions of the rainfall required to
              trigger  landsliding and mobilization of a debris flow; (3) identifying  the
              deformation mechanisms that produce debris flows: and (4)  modeling long-term
              erosion rates by shallow landsliding.  The  data generated in the initial field
              work will be used in  developing a deterministic slope stability model.  The
              resulting  predictions will be tested in a field experiment designed to 
              trigger slope failure.  The results will then be used to guide  stochastic
              modeling and empirical studies for establishing long-  term models of sediment
              transport by landsliding, and hence for  identifying risk.  The results of this
              project will demonstrate  the utility and limits of models representing field
              conditions  which in turn can be sued to assess and mitigate this hazard.  ***
