Abstract    :
              The goal of this project, funded as a  Research Planning  Grant (RPG) is to
              perform preliminary studies and develop a  long term research proposal to
              investigate strategies for  implementation of file system extensions in widely
              used  operating systems. Examples of extensions under  consideration include
              disconnected operation, weak and  partial connectivity, informed prefetching
              and  file  reference tracing. The major difficulty in transferring  these
              technologies into commercial practice stems from  frequent inability to modify
              the native system source code.  Therefore, alternative mechanisms and tools,
              such as  microkernel augmented DLLs, installable file systems,  loadable
              modules, proxies and TSR programs, will be  considered.  The scope of the 
              study will span the families  of all widely used operating systems such as
              Windows family,  Unix family, and OS/2 family.  In addition to the inability 
              to modify the native system source code, constraints such as  hardware
              limitations, and the effect of the extension on  system performance will be
              investigated. The long term goal  of this research is to develop a set of
              guidelines for  practical implementation of file system extensions, and  study
              their impact on the native system, thereby furnishing  a vital missing link in
              the transfer of file system research  results into computer practice.***
