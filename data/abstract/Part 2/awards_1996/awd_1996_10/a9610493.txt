Abstract    :
                This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry
              Program, addresses the thermodynamics of adsorption on  well characterized
              surfaces in a unique way.  A direct adsorption  single crystal microcalorimeter
              has been developed by Professor  Campbell and his students at the University of
              Washington which  has the sensitivity to directly determine the enthalpy of 
              adsorption of a range of metal on oxide and metal on  semiconductor systems. 
              In addition, the adsorption of metals on  polymers, and hydrocarbons on
              platinum are being investigated  using this new instrument.  This unique
              information is crucial to  the understanding of a variety of important surface
              processes,  ranging from electronic device fabrication to heterogeneous 
              catalysis.  In order to understand surface reaction chemistry, which forms  the
              basis of many important interfacial technologies, the basic  thermodynamic
              information about the heats of adsorption of atoms  and molecules on surfaces
              must be known.  This basic research  effort addresses this question through a
              unique experimental  approach to the direct measurement of these quantities. 
              The  results of these investigations will find wide application in 
              technologies including semiconductor processing and catalytic  chemistry.
