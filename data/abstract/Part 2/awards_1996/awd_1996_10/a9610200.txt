Abstract    :
              Dynamics and thermodynamics of the upper atmospheric regions including
              mesosphere and thermosphere must be studied on a global scale because of the
              central importance of horizontal transport, planetary-scale waves, and coupling
              of these regions.  Most investigations of these regions have been in the
              northern hemisphere, while those in the southern hemisphere have been made in
              Antarctica and at low midlatitudes in Australia and New Zealand.  This grant
              will support U.S. involvement in operating an optical high-resolution
              spectrometer at the University of Canterbury's Mount John Astronomical
              Observatory.  The PI will expand upon optical investigations of the
              simultaneous dynamics of the southern hemisphere mesosphere and lower
              thermosphere (MLT)'s motions and temperature.  He will re-investigate the
              climatology of these motions, along with kinetic temperature at those heights.
