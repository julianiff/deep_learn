Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9610140     Professor Victor E. Henrich of Yale University is
              being funded by the Kinetics and Catalysis-CRP-CTS and the Solid State
              Chemistry-DMR programs. He will investigate the contribution of delocalized
              electronic states to chemisorption on transition-metal-doped oxides, taking as
              model Cr-doped V203 single crystal.  The electronic structure of the model
              catalytic oxide will be varied independently from the structure over a wide
              range of doping with Cr.  The surface electronic structure will also be
              controlled by taking advantage of the hysteresis of the metal-insulator
              transition with temperature.  The system will be studied with UHV techniques
              (UPS, XPS, LEEDS, HREELS, Auger, inverse photoelectric techniques) and by
              chemisorption and TPD of probe molecules such as CO, H20, O2, and NO. This work
              is of relevance to fundamental chemisorption and catalysis, surface science,
              and materials science.
