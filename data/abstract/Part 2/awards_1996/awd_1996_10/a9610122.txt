Abstract    :
              The research supported under this award will extend the formal negotiation
              modeling frameworks of game theory---an approach that guarantees stable
              interactions among self-interested agents---to incorporate richer models of
              communication, belief revision, and computation. The research investigates
              models of how communication and belief revision can lead to changes in the
              preferences that agents use to compute negotiation moves that are rational in a
              game-theoretic sense. A metric for comparing negotiation protocols will be
              devised, and optimal protocols will be chosen using this metric. Then, a full
              strategic analysis of these types of negotiation process will be performed,
              accompanied by additional formal analysis, implementation studies and
              experimentation. The practical objective is facilitating the design of software
              for automated negotiations among both human and artificial agents.
