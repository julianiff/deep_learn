Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    Proposal Number: CTS 96-10402  Principal Investigator: Dutton   
              This is a grant to purchase an injection-seeded ND:YAG laser that will be
              dedicated to supporting two ongoing fluid dynamics research programs.  The
              first project is aimed at obtaining quantitative, time-resolved measurements of
              molecular mixing in high Reynolds number jets and shear layers.  The diagnostic
              technique that has been developed for this purpose uses the simultaneous
              excitation of planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) from a cold chemistry
              tracer seeded in one stream and a passive scalar tracer seeded in another
              stream, such that the fraction of jet fluid mixed at the molecular level can be
              determined.  The second project has as its objective the development and
              application of a new three-laser coherent anti-Stokes Raiman scattering (CARS)
              technique for the simultaneous measurement of pressure, temperature, and
              density in high-speed gas flows.  For these measurements the wavelelgths of the
              second pump laser and the Stokes laser are selected so that the vibrational and
              pure rotational spectra of nitrogen are simultaneously acquired.  Pressure and
              temperature can be determined from the shape of the three-laser CARS spectra,
              and density is obtained from an equation of state.
