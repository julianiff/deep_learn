Abstract    :
              9610420  Kang  The Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering at  the
              University of Maryland Baltimore County will purchase a  Near Infrared Time
              Resolved Spectroscopy system, which will  be dedicated to support research and
              education in  engineering.  The equipment will be used for several  projects
              including in particular: deep vein thrombosis  detection in the leg, absorption
              and scattering coefficient  determination for a system; real-time automatic
              data  reduction; engineering control and bioinstrumentation  courses.  ***
