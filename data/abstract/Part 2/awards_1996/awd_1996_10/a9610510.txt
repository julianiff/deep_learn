Abstract    :
                  9610510  Corona    The progressive degradation and collapse of metal
              structural  members when subjected to the cyclic loading into the  plastic
              range of the material are to be investigated.  It  will concentrate in two
              important problems: buckling of  columns under cyclic axial loading and
              buckling of I and W  beams under cyclic bending.  The first case represents the
               most fundamental loading case in structural stability while  the second case
              represents some of the most widely used  shapes in construction.  The
              investigation of both problems  will be carried out using combined experimental
              and  analytical methods.   The results of the investigation  should yield
              accurate knowledge of the degradation  mechanisms which lead to buckling under
              cyclic loading.
