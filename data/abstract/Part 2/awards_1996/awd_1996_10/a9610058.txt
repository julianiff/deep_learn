Abstract    :
                    Abstract - Chan  CTS-9706706        A thin-filament pyrometry system is
              assembled from components.  The     system combines the nonperturbing qualities
              of laser-based diagnostics with     the simplicity of thermometive probes.  The
              system permits time-dependent,    simultaneous measurement at all locations
              along a line through a transient     flame.  The pyrometer system will be used
              in research on turbulence-radiation    interactions in flames, overshooting of
              flamelet structure for turbulent     radiating flames, and the ignition and
              extinction of alternative fuels.
