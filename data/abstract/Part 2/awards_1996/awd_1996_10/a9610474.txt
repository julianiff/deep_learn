Abstract    :
              9610474  Epstein  There are three primary objectives of this study: To furnish 
              the design community procedures for appropriately  incorporating block shear
              considerations for connections of  structural shapes not previously tested
              (mainly structural  tees); to provide further experimental data and analytical 
              evidence concerning the effect that eccentricity has block  shear, and; to
              evaluate the capacity of existing structures.  All specimens will be ones that
              could reasonably be used in  an actual design.  Various individual parameters
              of the  connection geometry will be varied and both 36 and 50 ksi  yield steels
              will be used.  Finite element studies of the  problem will play an integral
              part in meeting the  objectives.
