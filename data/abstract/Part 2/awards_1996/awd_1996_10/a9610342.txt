Abstract    :
              The goals of this pilot project are to:  1) demonstrate the utility of a simple,
              expandable, and cost-effective strategy in identifying a set of genetic markers
              that are highly variable in several populations, and  2) develop a simple
              genetic assay for such a set of markers.  To achieve these goals, the allele
              frequencies of one hundred and sixty common genetic markers in the three major
              subpopulations in the United States (Caucasian, Hispanic, and African American)
              will be estimated by automated DNA sequencing.  A set of 40 markers that are
              evenly distributed across the human genome and that are informative in all
              three populations will be selected for high-throughput genetic assay
              development.  This approach can be expanded easily in parallel with the
              development of a high-density genetic map of the human genome.  With a large
              number of informative genetic markers available, an appropriate subset of them
              can be tailored for use in studying population history, mechanisms of
              evolution, disease resistance and susceptibility, and many other questions
              being asked in the full-scale Human Genome Diversity Project.  Answers to these
              questions will not only provide insights in anthropology and population
              biology, but also promote global unity and health.
