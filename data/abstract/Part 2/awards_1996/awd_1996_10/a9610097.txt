Abstract    :
              9610097  Ramonde    The  1997  Aspen Winter Conference will devote one week  to 
              condensed  matter  physics.  The  focus  will be on mesoscopic  physics, 
              reduced  dimensionality systems, and correlated electrons. The conference  will
               be  interdisciplinary, and will bring together leading scientists from 
              academia and industry to critically assess the current level knowledge  and
              what remains to be learned in the future. NSF support will provide  financial
              assistance to graduate students and young scientists.  %%%  The  1997  Aspen
