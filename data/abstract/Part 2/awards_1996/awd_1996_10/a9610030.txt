Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS 9610030    The PIs propose to develop theories of multicomponent
              adsorption capable of making reliable predictions of selectivity and heats of
              adsorption.  Since reliable experimental data are scarce, the objective of this
              proposal is to measure thermodynamic excess functions:  the excess Gibbs free
              energy ((Ge) and heat of mixing ((He). The excess Gibbs free energy contains
              information about adsorbed-phase activity coefficients and the selectivity; the
              heat of mixing is needed to determine the change in temperature of the system
              during adiabatic operation of pressure-swing-adsorption (PSA) processes.  These
              excess functions of adsorbed mixtures will be determined with a
              microcalorimeter which measures simultaneously the selectivity and the
              individual heats of adsorption of the components of the mixture.  Statistical
              mechanical theories of adsorption lead naturally to the prediction of
              theoretical values of excess functions.  Therefore precise experimental data on
              selected real measures are desirable as test material against which the
              usefulness of competing theories can be judged.    The systems chosen for
              initial studies are:  1.  CH4 and C2H6 in silicate at low loading.  2.  CO2 and
              C2H6 in NaX.  3.  CO2 and C2H4 in NaX.  4.  CHF2CHF2 (HFC-134) and CF3CH2F
              (HFC-134a) in Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs cation-exchanged forms of X and Y zeolites.  5.
               CH4 and SF6 in cylindrical, one-dimensional pored composed of 10, 12, and 14
              membered rings.    These five systems were selected to isolate the principal
              variables which determine selectivity: the pore size and electric field inside
              the micropores of the zeolite and the polarity, size, and shape of the
              adsorbate molecules.    The significance of the proposed measurements is that
              they will provide a systematic way of handling the temperature dependence of
              adsorption of single gases and multicomponent mixtures, which is critical for
              the design of adsorptive separation processes.
