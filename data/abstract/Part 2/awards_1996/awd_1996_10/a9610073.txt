Abstract    :
              9610073  Puleo  This research is directed at the development and  understanding
              of methods for biochemical surface  modification of bioinert orthopedic and
              dental implant  materials.  Specifically, biomaterials with plasma-deposited 
              thin films will be used to deliver and retain osteoinductive  bone
              morphogenetic protein (BMP) at the cell-biomaterial  interface so as to induce
              expression of the osteoblast  phenotype and thus promote mineralization.  The
              specific  aims of the research are to: (1) quantify the benefit to the  amount
              and/or stability/retention of BMP-2 provided by  immobilization on plasma
              treated metallic biomaterials, (2)  characterize the bioactivity of
              BMP-conjugated biomaterials  by assessing expression of osteoblastic traits in
              vitro  using two pluripotent mesenchymal cell types, (3) determine  the
              individual and combined roles of weakly and strongly  bound BMP-2 in promoting
              osteoinduction in vitro.  This  research could provide knowledge to help
              promote early  fixation and compensate for gaps between bone and implant in 
              orthopedic and dental applications.  ***
