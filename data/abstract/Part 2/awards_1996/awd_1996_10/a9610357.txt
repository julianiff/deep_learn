Abstract    :
              9610357    The U. S. University Council on Geotechnical Engineering  Research
              (USUCGER)  is a nonprofit and independent organization which represents 
              universities  in the U.S. where geotechnical engineering research is 
              conducted.  Recently, the paradigm concerning the mechanism of funding 
              research has  been significantly altered.  While it is believed that the  bulk
              of  geotechnical research is currently being funded by federal  agencies, the 
              current trend in federal funding is the total monies for  research is being 
              reduced.  The purpose of this research is to conduct a self-  assessment  which
              will provide a benchmark of the current state of  geotechnical  engineering
              research, to disseminate it to the profession  through various  mechanisms, and
              to establish partnerships with industry.  The results will  be presented at a
              workshop of USUCGER members,  representatives of funding  agencies, and the
              end-users of geotechnical research.  ***
