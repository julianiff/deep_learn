Abstract    :
              FORMANEK   96-10118        This project has two parts, both concerned with nxn
              matrices over a  field.  The first part is the classification of the
              irreducible n-dimensional  representations of certain infinite groups, such as
              braid groups, mapping class   groups, and Torelli groups.  While there is
              presently no possibility of a   complete classification in all dimensions, a
              classification in low dimensions   should be possible.  Note that many
              representations of braid groups have been  constructed by both mathematicians
              and physicists, especially in connection  with the Yang-Baxter equation.  The
              second part is the study of the invariants  and identities of nxn matrices.    
                  This is research in ring theory and group theory, two branches of  
              algebra.  The problems and methods to attack them are combinatorial, and  deal
              with particular rings and groups, rather than general theory.  As noted  above,
              some of these questions are also of interest to physicists.
