Abstract    :
                    The objective of this project is to develop computer modeling techniques
              for evaluating formability in tube hydroforming without costly and time
              consuming tryouts.  The study will:    (1) identify the critical process
              parameters in tube hydroforining and determine the interactions between them; 
              (2)   establish a method for estimating material properties, needed for process
              simulation, under high pressure; (3) develop criteria for predicting fracture
              and wrinkling in computer simulations;  (4) develop techniques to determine the
              required properties of the initial tube using reverse engineering techniques
              once the final part properties are specified; and (5) establish a method for
              economic evaluation of tube hydroforming against conventional manufacturing
              processes for a given application.       This research project could generate
              valuable knowledge so that the full potential of this hydroforming process
              could be dramatically improved by: (1) reducing the trial and error in the tool
              and process development, thereby increasing the machine utilization rate and
              saving valuable engineering effort; and (2) expanding the geometric
              capabilities of the process to manufacture parts with ever increasing geometric
              complexity.  In addition to contributing to the fundamental understanding of
              the tube hydroforming process, this project will contribute to the development
              of Finite Element Analysis based guidelines for tool and process design to
              achieve the maximum process/shape capability in tube hydroforming.
