Abstract    :
              This research focuses on the compiler and architectural issues of concurrent 
              multithreaded architectures.  These architectures allow multiple threads to be 
              active simultaneously to achieve multiple instruction issue in a single machine
               cycle.  The architectural research focuses on the design of thread execution 
              units that include support for communication between threads, for speculative 
              thread execution, and for thread pipelining.  Simulation at the functional and 
              register-transfer levels will be the primary tool for this research.  The 
              compiler research focuses on integrating optimization for thread and
              instruction  level parallelism.  This research will take place in the context
              of modifications  to the gcc compiler.  While threads can be used to allow
              multiple independent  programs to execute concurrently, the primary focus of
              this project is speeding  up the execution of a single program.
