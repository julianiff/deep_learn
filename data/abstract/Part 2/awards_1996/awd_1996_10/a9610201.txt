Abstract    :
              KIRILLOV  This research is concerned with the representation theory of  quantum
              groups and its relation with combinatorics and mathematical  physics. The
              principal investigator will work on two problems.  The  first problem concerns
              a geometric realization of Lusztig's canonical  basis, using the identification
              of modules over a quantum group with  the homology of a certain local system on
              the configuration space,  which is due to Schechtman and Varchenko. Such a
              realization would  reveal a new deep relation between combinatorics and the
              geometric  structures of mathematical physics. The second continues the study
              of  special functions appearing in representation theory and related 
              combinatorial identities. In particular, the principal investigator  will work
              on the generalization of the inner product identities for  Macdonald's
              polynomials to affine root systems, and on on further  properties of this inner
              product, such as positivity and its relation  with the inner product on the
              space of conformal blocks in conformal  field theory.  This study is in the
              general area of representation theory of Lie  algebras and related objects, and
              is important both for mathematics  and physics.
