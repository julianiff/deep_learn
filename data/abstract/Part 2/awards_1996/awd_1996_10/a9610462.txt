Abstract    :
                This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry
              Program, addresses the dynamics of high energy particle  bombardment of organic
              surfaces, and the laser ablation of these  systems.  The computational studies
              of this project focus on  questions of angular distribution and identity of
              sputtered  species, and in the case of the laser ablation simulations, also 
              consider the possibility of excitation and relaxation processes  in the
              desorption.  Close interaction with experimentalists  studying these processes
              is a hallmark of the computational  studies being carried out here by Professor
              Garrison and her  students at Pennsylvania State University.  The detailed 
              understanding of these processes is essential to the development  of processing
              and analytical techniques in the semiconductor  industry and in the analysis of
               biomaterials and organic interfaces.  A detailed understanding of the dynamics
              of ion or photon induced  desorption of organic species from organic thin films
              is  necessary for the development of analysis tools in the electronic 
              materials industry and for the design of biomaterials and  biocompatible
              interfaces.  One approach  to developing this understanding is to simulate the
              processes  computationally, and to search for insights into the processes 
              based on these simulations.  This is the goal of this research  project.
