               Project Summary     The Department of Chemical Engineering at Northwestern
              University will purchase equipment for performing nuclear magnetic resonance.
              (NMR) diffusion measurements on an existing NMR spectrometer at Northwestern. 
              The equipment con-  sists of a diffusion package, including an amplifier and
              spectrometer software, as well    as a custom-built pulsed field gradient NMR
              diffusion probe.  The equipment will be dedicated to support research in
              engineering.  It will be used for several research projects,  including 1) and
              investigation of mass transfer effects in zeolite catalysis, 2) studies of
              multicomponent diffusion in zeolites, 3) research on small-molecule diffusion
              in polymer solutions, 4) studies of polymer diffusion in polymer situations and
              5) investigations of small-molecule diffusion in bulk polymers.  As part of the
              general user facility that maintains the NMR spectrometer, the new equipment
              will be made available to researchers working on other projects as well.
