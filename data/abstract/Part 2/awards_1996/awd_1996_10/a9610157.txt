Abstract    :
              DMS 9610157    WORKSHOP ON STOCHASTIC MODEL BUILDING AND VARIABLE SELECTION  
              ABSTRACT     As statistical analysis and modeling of larger and more complex
              data   sets is becoming more common, new and better computer based tools for  
              guiding the initial specification of the main features of statistical   models
              are being developed.  Recently, a new generation of stochastic   algorithms has
              been emerging as an important augmentation to   traditional deterministic
              strategies.  Examples include stochastic   search methods for variable
              selection, graphical models, selection of   variable transformations and
              interactions, wavelet thresholding, ARMA   modeling, CART, MARS, neural
              networks and more.  A workshop on   stochastic model building and variable
              selection that blends   methodology and case studies will significantly advance
              this field of   statistical research and will encourage dissemination of an
              important   class of modeling techniques to practitioners.     The workshop is
              organized in coordination with the NBER/NSF Time   Series Seminar and with the
              Workshop on Wavelets in Statistics. The   common research themes between
              stochastic model building, wavelets   analysis and times series analysis will
              be exploited to create both a   synergy at the research level and savings in
              travel expenses and   arrangements.  Funds from this grant will be used for
              domestic travel   expenses for participants based in the U.S.A, particularly
              junior   researchers, and others from underrepresented groups.
