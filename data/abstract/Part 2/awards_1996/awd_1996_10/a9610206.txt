Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University to
              acquire two state-of-the-art NMR  consoles to upgrade existing 300 MHz NMR
              Spectrometers and retrofit the AC consoles to  upgrade the IBM WP-270 MHz NMR.
              This equipment will enhance research in a number of  areas including the
              following: (1) metallobiochemistry of co-enzyme B12-dependent  ribonucleotide
              reductase, (2) development of methodology for synthesis of modified 
              oligonucleotides, (3) synthesis of unnatural nucleoside   analogs based on
              cyclobutenone  chemistry, (4) formamidines and other chiral carbanions, (5)
              synthesis and application of highly  fluorinated weakly coordinating anions,
              (6) quinocarcin mechanism of DNA cleavage and (7)  bioorganic and bioinorganic
              chemistry of vanadium and phosphorous.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown 
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
              state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying
              out frontier research. The results from  these NMR studies are useful in the
              areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
