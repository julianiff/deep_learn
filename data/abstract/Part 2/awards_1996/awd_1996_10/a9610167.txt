Abstract    :
              9610167  Raj    The focus of this SGER project is the measurement of thermal 
              conductivity of interfaces in metal-ceramic composites.  The  research
              concentrates on a detailed study of particulate  composites consisting of a
              pure aluminum matrix dispersed  with particles of magnesium aluminate spinel. 
              This is  motivated by preliminary evidence that interfaces in  aluminum-spinel
              composites enhance the overall thermal  conductivity of the composite, in stark
              contrast to the  conventional finding that composite interfaces reduce  thermal
              conductivity.  The effort includes preparation of  several specimens with
              different volume fractions and  different particle sizes of spinel.  The
              thermal  diffusivities of these specimens are measured and the  microstructure
              carefully characterized to confirm or refute  the existence of an anomalous
              thermal conduction along the  aluminum-spinel interface.  The research is a
              collaboration  between the University of Colorado at Boulder and Virginia 
              Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, VA.  If this  exploratory research
              produces a positive result then a  regular proposal to investigate the
              phenomenon at an  atomistic level will be submitted to the Foundation.  %%% 
              This enhanced thermal conduction effect could be applied to  many commercially
              important materials systems, such as  electronic packaging and multilayer
              devices.  ***
