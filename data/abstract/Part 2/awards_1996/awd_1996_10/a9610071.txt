Abstract    :
              9610071  Pfeiffer  This award to University of Delaware will provide a new CTD
              (conductivity, temperature, depth) instrument for use on R/V Cape Henlopen, a
              120-foot research vessel operated as part of the University National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The shared-use instrumentation
              supported here will assist marine scientists conduct studies in coastal and
              continental shelf regions along the US East Coast in 1997 and in future years.
