Abstract    :
              9610326  Fayer    Experimental and associated theoretical investigations of 
              dynamics in complex liquids, supercooled liquids, the glass  transition, and
              glasses will be carried out.  The emphasis  is on understanding the
              relationship among molecular level  dynamics, intermolecular interactions and
              structure.  Experimental approaches will include vibrational echo  experiments,
              transient grating optical Kerr effect, and  ultrafast UV photon echo
              experiments.  %%%  The emphasis in this study is on complex liquids that 
              include liquid crystals, polymer melts, and supercooled  liquids, all systems
              of significant importance to materials  processing of, for example, optical
              flat panel display  devices and structural materials.  ***
