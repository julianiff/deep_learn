Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Proposal Number:  CTS-9610123  Principal Investigator:  James R.
              Engstrom  Institution:  Cornell University      Probes for an existing UHV
              reactor dedicated to semiconductor thin-film deposition will be purchased. 
              They will include:  a quadrupole mass spectrometer with molecular-beam
              compatible cross-beam ionizer and negative or positive ion detection
              capability: a translation stage for sample positioning; a refrigeration trap
              for the quadrupole mass spectrometer; a lock-in amplifier for reverse-view LEED
              or retarding-field Auger spectroscopy; and accessories.
