Abstract    :
              Multi-TAC  is  a  learning system that automatically  synthesizes  heuristic
              programs for combinatorial problems, including resource  allocation  and 
              scheduling problems. This  project  investigates  fundamental research areas
              that will enable Multi-TAC to be  used  for  computationally challenging
              problems.  The first goal is  to  develop  fast  methods  for searching  the 
              space  of  algorithms  evaluated   by  Multi-TAC  during  the  synthesis  
              process.   In  particular,  the research focuses on methods for  predicting 
              how  well  an  algorithm  will perform based on a  quick  test  on  an  example
               problem instance. The second goal is to enable Multi-TAC  to  automatically 
              synthesize  very  efficient  iterative  repair  algorithms. This involves the
              development of generic schemas that  capture  the  structure of wide variety of
              such  algorithms.  The  last  goal  is  to  enable users to easily  specify 
              new  problem  domains  for  Multi-TAC, without needing to worry about  how  the
               details of their specification impacts the synthesis process.  In  particular,
                the  work  focuses  on  techniques  for   rewriting  constraints  so  that 
              they can be efficiently  evaluated.   This  research  project  provides an
              important  step  towards  problem-  solving systems that can automatically
              configure themselves for a  particular application.
