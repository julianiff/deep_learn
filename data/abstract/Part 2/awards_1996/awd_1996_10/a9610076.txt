Abstract    :
              9610076  Chen    The principal investigators will study second order partial
              differential   equations of elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic types containing
              certain types   of nonlinearities. The objectives are:  (a) The exploration of
              spatio-temporal   chaotic vibration phenomena for the one dimensional wave
              equation with   nonlinear boundary conditions;  (b) The use of boundary
              elements and   quasimonotone iteration techniques to analyze and compute
              controlled   coupled semilinear elliptic and parabolic systems with point
              observations   and inequality control constraints; (c) Visualization of state
              and control on   annular and dumbbell-shaped domains by varying the geometries
              involved   in order to understand the control effects.    The two investigators
              will develop effective and innovative theoretical as   well as numerical tools
              to study the nonlinear problems involved. This   research promises to enhance,
              through visualization, the understanding of   complex nonlinear phenomena and
              pattern formation in many fields such as   mechanical vibration, acoustics,
              mathematical biology, chemostat and   chemical reactors, and ecology. This in
              turn will further aid in the   development of new mathematical techniques for
              nonlinear sciences.
