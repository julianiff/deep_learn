Abstract    :
              This research project deals with the development of a methodology  for the
              simulation, analysis and design of high-order, complex  nonlinear dynamical
              systems that have an underlying multiple time-  scale structure. The
              methodology provides for time-scale  identification, efficient numerical
              simulation, and reduced-order  model development. The specific objectives of
              the project are to  extend the (CSP) Computational Singular Perturbation to a
              wide  class of multiple time-scale optimal control problems, establish 
              rigorous theoretical foundations for the method, develop and test  algorithms,
              and apply the algorithms to design problems in  robotics and aeronautics. The
              fundamental issues being addressed  are: how to identify multiple time-scale
              structure in a nonlinear  system and how to exploit multiple time-scale
              structure for  simplified simulation, analysis and design. the research 
              establishes a significant new capability for nonlinear system  design. the
              order reduction, better conditions, and physical  understanding - previously
              obtainable only for low-order systems  by analysts applying the analytical
              singular perturbation method  - will be obtainable for high-order, complex,
              nonlinear systems  that have multiple time-scale behavior - systems such as 
              machines, structures, ground vehicles, aircrafts, spacecrafts,  robots, and
              other mechanical systems.
