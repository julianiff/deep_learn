Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to conduct an experimental and theoretical
              investigation into the behavior and design of concrete beams reinforced with
              three-dimensional (3-D) prefabricated fiber reinforced plastic spatial
              reinforcement cages.  3-D spatial reinforcement cages, most conveniently
              fabricated from pultruded grating components, will require innovative research
              in the areas of manufacturing, design, modeling, analysis and construction
              economics.  Based on results of a recently conducted pilot study it appears
              that 3-D FRP reinforced beams have significant structural potential due to
              their ability to fail progressively in a pseudo-ductile manner.  They also
              appear to have significant construction potential due to their prefabricated
              industrialized manufacturing that could yield construction cost saving because
              of reduced labor costs.  The research will focus on the following items: 
              Development of new integrated 3-D FRP pultruded reinforcement cages,
              characterization of mechanical properties of 3-D pultruded reinforcement cages,
              optimization of elements for 3-D reinforcement cages, design and analysis of
              concrete beams reinforced with 3-D FRP cages, and a study of the construction
              productivity and economic benefits of the use of 3-D FRP cages.
