Abstract    :
              9610026    This research will experimentally test a promising  analytical
              approximation  for determining elastic moduli and strengths of jointed rock 
              masses.  The  approximation in question is an equivalent properties theory 
              that avoids  the usual restrictive assumption of a representative volume 
              element (RVE).  The non-representative volume element (NRVE) theory tested 
              here produces  results that compare favorably with the true equivalent 
              properties obtained  for detailed computations.  Comparisons form a series of 
              numerical  experiments in the elastic domain (Hooke's law), the seepage  domain
               (Darcy's law) and the coupled domain (Biot's law) and  recently in the 
              elastic-plastic domain are usually within a few percent.  The additional 
              testing and verification undertaken here is therefore  expected to be 
              worthwhile.    The main benefit of a technically sound procedure for 
              estimating rock mass  properties from the properties of the joints and intact
              rock  between the  joints is more accurate engineering design of excavations in
               jointed rock  masses.  Excavation analysis in very blocky rock masses and,  at
              the other  extreme, rock masses that are almost free from joints may be 
              handled by  existing methods.  However, there is a large class of  problems in
              between  that could benefit from a demonstrably more reliable  determination of
              rock  mass properties.  Benefits would eventually appear in the  form of
              improved  stability and economy of rock mass excavations.  *****
