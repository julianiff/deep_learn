Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS 9610115  Richard I. Masel    Professor Richard I. Masel, of the
              University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, is being funded by the Chemical
              Reactions Processes-Kinetics and Catalysis program to continue his studies of
              adsorption of small organic molecules on model transition metal surfaces.  He
              will continue to develop a theoretical approach to predicting surface chemical
              mechanisms.  The basic hypothesis of the theoretical model is that intrinsic
              barriers calculated for decomposition reactions in the gas phase are equal to
              the intrinsic barriers for those decompositions on surfaces.  Experimentally,
              the model is tested with EELS and TPD spectroscopies.  In this work, Masel
              proposes to do more detailed characterization of the intrinsic barriers for
              C-C, C-O, C-H and O-H bond scissions, in terms of parameters such as
              substituent groups in the organic molecules or presence of coadsorbates, and
              nature of the chemisorbing surface.  It is focused on the measurement of heats
              of reaction, bond energies, and intrinsic activation barriers for specific test
              reactions, for which model predictions will be made with the aid of
              computational quantum chemistry.  The role of net charges in the intrinsic
              barrier model will also be assessed.  This research is of major significance
              for the theory and practice of catalysis and surface chemistry.
