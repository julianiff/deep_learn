Abstract    :
                 9610130     Anand   Whatever  the  mode of' transportation, materials  used 
              in   construction  of vehicles need to combine -good  structural   stiffness.
              strength, and toughness with high resistance  to   corrosion,  and they must be
              as lightweight as possible  in   order  to  save fuel.  Aluminum alloys have
              long been  used   for  skins and frames of aircraft. and are beginning to  be  
              used in the automotive industry.  Two other important light   metals  for  the
              transportation industry ire  titanium  and   magnesium.   The  recent progress
              in the development  of  a   mathematical  theory  of polycrystalline 
              plasticity  which   predicts not only the anisotropic macroscopic stress-strain
                response  and  shape  changes, but also  the  evolution  of  
              crystallographic texture during deformation,  has  occurred   primarily  for 
              materials  with  face-centered-cubic  (fcc)   crystals. Much less progress of
              this type has occurred  for   materials   with   hexagonal-close-packed   (hcp)
                crystal   structure.  Compared with fcc materials, the hcp  materials  
              exhibit  more complex modes of plastic deformation  due  to   their lower
              symmetry.  Inelastic deformation resistances of   different  slip systems can
              be substantially  different  in   the  hcp materials, and unlike the fcc
              aluminum alloys, the   hcp  titanium  and  magnesium  alloys  exhibit 
              deformation   twinning.   This  causes pronounced anisotropies  in  their  
              macroscopic   deformation   characteristics,   and    these   anisotropies  
              need  to  be  properly  accounted   for   in   developing a robust
              computational capability for      1. Process Design - deformation processing,
              and      2. Product  design  -  improved  structural  response   of      
              components,    made from titanium and magnesium1.  Of particular importance  is
              the development of a fundamental understanding of the  inelastic deformation
              behavior of these materials by slip  and twinning, and the development of
              accurate elasto-  viscoplastic constitutive equations  which describe this 
              deformation behavior.          We  propose  to  develop  anisotropic, 
              elasto-plastic   constitutive  equations  and computational  procedures  for  
              modeling  and  simulation of inelastic deformation  due  to   both 
              crystallographic slip ,and twinning in  hcp  titanium   and magnesium.  The
              computational capability will be useful   in  simulating  the development of
              anisotropy  due  to  the   evolution  of  crystallographic texture.  The 
              mathematical   models and procedures that we propose to develop should  be  
              useful in the design of a variety of deformation-processing   operations,  and 
              the design of components  for  structural   performance.   
              _______________________________  1 Although the majority of processing of
              magnesium allows is  done by casting, magnesium is also wrought to form tubes, 
              plates, and sheet.
