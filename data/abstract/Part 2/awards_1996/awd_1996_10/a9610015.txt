Abstract    :
              The aim of this research is to devise new methods for  automating reasoning via
              understanding and exploiting  computationally tractable classes of reasoning
              tasks.  Fundamental to the approach is the hypothesis that  intelligent
              behavior is accomplished through utilization of  idealized models of the task's
              environment. To explain how  people perform so well on tasks that are
              theoretically  intractable, we must assume that approximation methods based  on
              idealized tractable models cover a significant portion of  intelligent
              activity, and hence such methods should serve as  the basis for automated
              reasoning systems.  A language that  has been found useful for modeling and
              solving  compuationally intensive tasks in artificial intelligence is 
              constraint networks, and use of these networks.  By using  idealized tractable
              models, constraint networks, and other  techniques found useful in this area,
              it is hoped that real-  life problemq can be solved automatically in reasonable
              time  as well as humans solve them.
