Abstract    :
              9610335  Dye  This project is focused on the synthesis and  characterization of
              crystalline salts that  contain the products of reaction between alkali  metals
              such as lithium, sodium and potassium and  various organic complexants to form
              two novel  types of compounds:  alkalides, containing  alkali metal anions in
              crown ether and cryptand  salts, and electrides, in which the positive  charge
              of complex cations is balanced by cavity-  delocalized electrons rather than by
              anions.  Of  particular interest here are compounds in which  electrons have
              nearly the same chemical  potential as trapped electrons in cavities or as 
              aromatic radical anions.  Solid compounds in  which the electron density is
              distributed  between the two sites should have interesting  electronic,
              magnetic and optical properties,  together with the possibility of room 
              temperature stability.  %%%  These investigations may lead to the use of 
              electrides and alkalides as solid-state  electronic devices, and as novel
              reagents for  synthesis and catalysis.  They will also provide  an opportunity
              to study in a new class of  materials current problems in photophysics 
              including Rydberg-type  ground states, inter-electron magnetic  interactions
              and spinwaves, electronic  conductivity in 1,2 and 3 dimensions, and non- 
              metal to metal transitions.  ***
