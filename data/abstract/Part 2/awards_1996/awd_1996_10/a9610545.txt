Abstract    :
              9610545    In the U. S. and world-wide, there are many existing dams  that need
              to be  inspected for potential deterioration of materials, to  verify
              compliance  with upgraded design requirements, or to respond to long  term loss
              in  performance or safety.  In response to the increasing demand  for 
              electricity, new dams will be needed around the world.    The foundations of
              large dams are key to the performance of  the overall  structure.  Changes in
              stress levels (e.g. from changes in  reservoir levels  or temperature) can be
              responsible for changes in  permeability due to joint  opening and closure. 
              Joint and rock mass permeability  affects the  magnitude and distribution of
              the uplift pressure at the  foundation, as  well as the efficiency of grout and
              drainage curtains.  The  uplift  pressure, in turn, determines the stability of
              the dam  against sliding.  Thus, development of a realistic uplift pressure 
              distribution is a  significant consideration in the design of new dams and/or 
              in the  evaluation of existing dams to satisfy higher seismic or  hydraulic
              design  requirements.    The research includes:  1) case studies of joint
              opening and  closure under  foundations of dams; 2) development of realistic
              uplift  pressure  distributions under flood conditions; 3) improvements in 
              monitoring plans  for dam foundations; 4) determinations of field-scale 
              hydromechanical  properties for the foundation rock mass and the dam/rock 
              interface; 5)  investigate the influence of factors such as dam geometry on 
              dam  performance and effectiveness of various remedial measures;  and 6)
              improve  understanding on the nature and basic characteristics of  flow through
               jointed rock.  ***
