Abstract    :
              This is an inter-institutional collaborative project involving Ramesh Jain at
              the University of California, San Diego and Raghu Ramakrishnan at the
              University of Wisconsin, Madison. The research focuses on content-based
              querying of large collections of images stored in a general-purpose (i.e.,
              application domain independent) database. The goal is to develop scalable
              methods for dealing with very large numbers of images by exploiting
              similarities in groups of images, e.g., a group of frontal face images. The
              approach taken is to provide the user with the ability to describe a collection
              of images in sufficient detail to allow the system to tailor feature
              extraction, indexing, etc., to support a rich class of content-based queries.
              Descriptions are in an "image data definition language" and are specified in
              terms of image characteristics such as color, shape, etc. The system
              architecture is designed to be extensible in that user-provided feature
              extraction algorithms can be easily incorporated, and efficient
              high-dimensional indexing techniques are utilized. While there have been many
              efforts to build systems that can effectively retrieve images from a given
              image domain, a general purpose system poses many difficult problems. This
              research is expected to greatly increase the expressiveness of content-based
              queries that can be efficiently supported in general image databases, making
              possible novel applications involving large numbers of images from diverse
              domains.
