Abstract    :
                  9610275  Hamrick  The proposed research will measure several factors
              involved with the breeding structure of populations of three Neotropical tree
              species, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Hymenaea courbaril and Spondias mombin. 
              These three species are pollinated by different pollinators, have different
              seed dispersal mechanisms and occur at very different population densities.
              Study sites will be located in disturbed and relatively undisturbed habitats
              located in the vicinity of Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panama and Palo
              Verde National Park, Costa Rica.    Genetic analyses of the progeny of several
              adult trees in each site will be used to determine relative levels of male and
              female reproductive success, levels of pollen and seed movement into each
              population and the genetic relatedness of the adults within each population. 
              These data will be used to determine whether the small fragmented populations
              in disturbed habitats are likely to lose genetic diversity or will suffer the
              consequences of increased rates of inbreeding. The expected results should
              prove useful for managing disturbed habitats to maximize species diversity and
              genetic diversity and for the restoration of forest habitats.
