Abstract    :
              Popescu 9610205  The principal investigator will pursue research in algebraic
              geometry, computational algebra, and computational algebraic geometry.  He will
              work on problems in the following areas:  (1) Calabi-Yau 3-folds, moduli and
              equations of abelian surfaces; (2) The Coble-Gale transform and free
              resolutions; (3) Vector bundle resolutions; and (4) Small codimensional smooth
              projective varieties.  The computational aspects involve the design of new
              algebraic algorithms and their implementation in some of the currently
              available systems: Macaulay, Macaulay2 and Schubert.  This is research in the
              field of algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of
              modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
              quarter-century.  In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in
              the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and
              conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in physics,
              theoretical computer science, and robotics.
