Abstract    :
                        9610440  Keer  The purpose of this study is to develop the
              experimental  techniques and predictive theoretical understanding needed  to
              engineer coatings that are optimized for use on basic  mechanical components
              such as bearings and gears.  The first  step of the study is to engineer
              equiaxed coatings which are  expected to have better in-plane strength than the
              current  columnar structure.  The proposed processing technique  involves
              renucleation of coating layers and/or high current,  low energy ion
              bombardment.  The mechanical and physical  properties of these coatings and
              their contact fatigue  resistance will be determined and correlated with 
              microstructure.  Theoretical models will be developed to  account for the
              correlations and to generalize them.  ***
