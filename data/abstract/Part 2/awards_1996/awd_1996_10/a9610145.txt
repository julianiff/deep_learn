Abstract    :
              9610145  Prinn     The project is a modeling study of reactive chemical
              compounds in the troposphere.  Two tasks will be undertaken.  First,
              atmospheric chemistry routines will be developed in a 3-dimensional Model for
              Atmospheric Transport and Chemistry (MATCH).  The routines will focus on marine
              atmospheric processes that determine concentrations of chemically and
              climatically important species (oxidants, sulfur species, aerosols).  The
              improved MATCH model will be applied to an analysis of measurements made during
              the Southern Hemisphere Marine Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-1) and
              during the North Atlantic Regional Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-2).
               This application to ACE data sets is intended to aid the interpretation of the
              field observations for remote (ACE-1) and perturbed (ACE-2) marine sites.  The
              second task will focus on improving climate-interactive models for natural
              fluxes of trace gases (e.g., CH4, N20). These interactive models will be
              incorporated into MATCH.  Observed or inferred chemical concentration data
              corresponding to present and past atmospheric states will be used to validate
              the trace gas flux models.   Overall, the model improvements, coupled with the
              analysis and interpretation of  ACE data sets, will advance the understanding
              of critical, reactive trace gases in the troposphere and their changing
              concentrations over time.
