Abstract    :
                    This project investigates resource-bounded measure and its  implications
              for central questions in computational complexity.  Weak completeness will be
              further developed as a tool for proving  intractability.  Such strong
              hypotheses as "NP does not have p-  measure 0" (already known to have numerous
              plausible  consequences) will be studied with particular attention to their 
              reasonableness and explanatory power.  New applications of the 
              resource-bounded probabilistic method will be sought, and  relationships among
              randomized complexity, circuit-size  complexity, natural proofs, and one-way
              functions will be  carefully examined.  The underlying theory of
              resource-bounded  measure will be extended in order to apply it to a wider
              variety  of problems and probability measures.  This will include a  systematic
              study of efficient martingales and transformations of  martingales. 
              Applications of the extended theory to algorithmic  information, computational
              depth, machine learning and  prediction, real-and complex-valued computation,
              and the  computation of higher-type functionals will be investigated.
