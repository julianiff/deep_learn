Abstract    :
                  9610515  Liu    The main objective of  this conference is to provide a forum
               for researchers and industrial practitioners from all over  the world to:
              review the state of the art; exchange ideas;  transfer to knowledge gained to
              industry for applications;  and ascertain the important industrial problems so
              that  research progress can be aimed in relevant directions.    PIs expect all
              US researchers to benefit by establishing  world-wide contact with individuals
              from this rapidly  growing region of the Pacific Rim and Australia who share 
              their research interests.  It will be especially beneficial  for young US
              researchers who will see, perhaps for the first  time, the larger context into
              which their work fits.
