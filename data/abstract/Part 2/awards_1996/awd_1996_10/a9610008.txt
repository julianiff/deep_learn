Abstract    :
              9610008  Findley  This award to University of Miami will provide new
              instrumentation to be used on research vessels operated by University of Miami
              (R/V Calanus) and Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution (R/V Seward Johnson
              and R/V Edwin Link).  Instrumentation includes water sampling bottles,
              conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) instrumentation and related sensors,
              shipboard computer LAN components, a subbottom profiling sonar system and
              replacement sensors for a MOCNESS sampling system.  University of Miami
              provides the technical support on HBOI research vessels, and all three vessels
              are operated as part of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System
              (UNOLS), available for use by academic researchers throughout the U.S.  The
              shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist researchers to conduct
              studies of the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico in 1997
              and in future years.  ***
