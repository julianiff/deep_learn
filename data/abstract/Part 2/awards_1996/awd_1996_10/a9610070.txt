Abstract    :
              Information Retrieval (IR) research involves computer programs to organize,
              classify, retrieve, evaluate, and display databases and search results. The IR
              field has a long history of rigorous evaluation in narrowly defined test
              environments. However, the current trend is toward more realistic test
              environments with larger databases, more sophisticated search engines, and
              evaluation of the human-system contribution to the search process. The focus of
              this workshop is to begin development of a toolkit of programs, environments,
              and tasks to be made widely available to researchers. The goal of the toolkit
              is to provide a more uniform basis for comparison of research by different
              groups and under different circumstances. Workshop presentations are devoted to
              identifying the available tools, their limitations, and the needs of current
              and future research. Reports from smaller working groups are to be integrated
              into a plan that will guide toolkit development in the near future. Furter
              information about the workshop and the workshop reports is available at
              <http://www.pitt.edu/~korfhage/ir-tools.html>.
