Abstract    :
              9610285  Zhu     The primary objective of this project is to determine the
              kinetics of atmospheric aldehyde reactions and their photochemistry. Aldehydes
              are key participants in photochemical reactions affecting smog processes; their
              photodissociation represents a major source of free radicals and organic
              aerosols for tropospheric photochemistry. Despite the importance of aldehyde
              photolysis in the chemistry of the troposphere, few studies of aldehyde
              photolysis product channels and quantum yields have been carried out either
              under atmospheric conditions or under conditions that can be readily
              extrapolated to those of the atmosphere. Free radicals, such as formyl
              radicals, are readily converted in the atmosphere to hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl
              radicals, which participate in photochemical oxidation processes.    In this
              project, studies of the photolysis of aldehydes with five carbon atoms or more,
              aromatic aldehydes, and dicarbonyls, will be carried out. The photolysis
              product channels and quantum yields will be characterized, as well as their
              dependence on photodissociation wavelengths. The relationship between the
              structure of alkyl side chains and photolysis quantum yields will be extracted
              for homologous series of aldehydes. The experimental studies will be carried
              out using pulsed laser photolysis coupled with a sensitive optical absorption
              technique, cavity ring-down spectroscopy. In addition to the photolysis
              studies, the kinetics and mechanisms of aldehyde formation reactions, such as
              the reaction of the methoxy radical with molecular oxygen, will be elucidated.
