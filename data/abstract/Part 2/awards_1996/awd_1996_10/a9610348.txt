Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with Markov decision processes (MDPs)  and
              concentrates on two problems (1) Finding conditions under  which there exist
              easily implementable optimal policies and (2)  Determining how to recognize
              these policies. Variants on these  problems are also studied, in particular
              finding easily  implementable approximations to policies and the computational 
              complexity of recognizing the policies and conditions.  This  grant will
              support a transition from a mathematical logic-based  approach to computer
              science (structural complexity theory) to an  engineering application-based
              approach.  The applications  focussed on in this proposal come from the field
              of planning, as  described both by computer scientists in Artificial
              Intelligence,  and electrical engineers in Discrete Event Systems.
