Abstract    :
              This project focuses on ethical and legal issues for genetics research in an
              American Indian community. First, conditions for such research involving the
              Apache Tribe of Oklahoma will be negotiated with the tribal government.
              Negotiations will address the following issues: privacy, group stigmatization,
              publication of findings, property rights, and the disposition of samples. The
              response of individual tribal members to genetics research will be studied.
              Second, research will address susceptibility to diabetes and resistance to
              cancer. A mutation first found in Pima Indians may affect the function of
              adrenaline, contributing risk for diabetes. In addition, a genetic variant in
              the male hormone system may offer protection from prostate cancer. The role of
              these factors in the health of this population will be tested, following
              guidelines negotiated with the tribe.   Prevention of diseases such as diabetes
              and cancer needs improvement. Relevant discoveries can arise from studying why
              health patterns vary in different populations. To achieve this goal of the
              Human Diversity Genome Project, it is crucial to satisfy ethical concerns about
              research from different cultural perspectives. This pilot study will explore
              how genetics researchers and indigenous communities can collaborate.
