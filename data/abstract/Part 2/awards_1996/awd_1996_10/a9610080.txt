Abstract    :
                                                This award from the Chemistry Research
              Instrumentation and Facilities Program will assist the  Department of Chemistry
              at University of California at Los Angeles to acquire a Silicon  Graphics Power
              Challenge L and four workstations. This equipment will enhance research in  a
              number of areas including the following: (1) theoretical studies of organic and
              biochemical  reactions, (2) developing new quantum molecular dynamics codes and
              studies of molecules and  reactions on surfaces, (3) development of new methods
              for fast and accurate protein crystal  structures, (4) studies of cluster
              quantum dynamics, and (5) statistical mechanics for the study  of polymers and
              fluids.     A workstation network of fast modern computer workstations is a new
              way to satisfy the  computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a "computer
              network" also serves as a  development environment for new theoretical codes
              and algorithms, provides state-of-art graphics  and visualization facilities,
              and supports research in state-of-the-art applications of parallel  processing.
