Abstract    :
              9610280  German    New research on supersolidus liquid phase sintering (SLPS) 
              addresses three topics.  The first examines microstructural  evolution during
              heating and sintering.  A current model of  the process makes assumptions on
              the rate of grain growth,  liquid film thickness, shrinkage rate, semisolid
              particle  viscosity, and causes of distortion.  These assumptions are 
              addressed by experimentation performed on model systems  using microstructure
              measurements from quenched samples and  in situ testing.  The goal is to
              increase the model reality  and to recognize any behavior between systems.  The
              second  topic is  the prediction of final component size and shape.  A
              computational prediction for the loss of structural  rigidity as liquid spreads
              on the grain boundaries needs  verification.  Furthermore, gradients in grain
              size,  particle size, packing density, substrate friction, and heat  transfer
              need to be included in the final component size and  shape predictions.  The
              third activity extends the model to  several other processing conditions
              (bimodal-sized powders,  powders of differing compositions, high viscosity
              systems,  reactive systems).  %%%  Success in this research should positively
              impact the use of  the SLPS process to produce full density, complex shapes via
               powder metallurgy.  A research target is tool steels where  there are
              opportunities to use SLPS in the near net-shape  production of high performance
              tooling.  ***
