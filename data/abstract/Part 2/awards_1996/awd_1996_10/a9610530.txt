Abstract    :
              9610530  Klaiber  In the past several years, there have been many successful 
              bridge workshops and conferences through which were  developed excellent
              communication and cooperation in the U.  S. "bridge community".  Such
              communication and cooperation  is equally valuable on the international scene
              as well.  In  July, the Seventh International Structural Faults and Repair 
              Conference will be held in Edinburgh, Scotland.  This  conference will provide
              an excellent opportunity for  international communication.  It is therefore,
              important  that a group of U. S. engineers participate in this  conference. 
              The participants will be selected by a Steering  Community based on submitted
              abstracts to the Conference.  Following the Conference, the U. S. team will
              participate in  a one-day technical tour developed in consultation with the 
              Conference organizer.  ***
