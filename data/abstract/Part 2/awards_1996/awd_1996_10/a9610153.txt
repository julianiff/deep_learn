Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9610153    Principal Investigator:  Amiya Sen    Title: 
              Control of Plasma Instabilities and Turbulence    New feedback control concepts
              will be coupled with electron/ion beam non-intrusive suppresser schemes for
              control or elimination of plasma instabilities, fluctuations, or turbulence. 
              This research could lead to significant advances in both fundamental studies of
              plasma turbulence and in industrial plasma process control.  Neural net
              controllers with architecture suitable for plasma control will also be
              investigated.  This investigation will be the first real time application of a
              neural net controller to a plasma system and, more generally, the first real
              time application of a neural net controller to a distributed parameter system.
