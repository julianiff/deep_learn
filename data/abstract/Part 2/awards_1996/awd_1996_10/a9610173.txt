                    ABSTRACT    K. Mopper & D. Kieber  OPP 9527255 & OPP 9610173   
              PHOTOCHEMICAL AND OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF ANTARCTIC WATERS IN  RESPONSE TO
              CHANGING UV-B FLUXES    The decrease in stratospheric ozone over the Antarctic 
              results in an increase in the UV-B flux in the euphotic  zone. The increase
              leads to cellular damage to aquatic  organisms, as documented by
              photo-inhibition and decreased  productivity. Cellular damage can occur either 
              intracellularly, or externally at the cell surface from  biomolecular reactions
              with externally-generated reactive  transients. The extent of this
              extracellular damage will  depend on the photochemistry of the seawater
              surrounding the  cell. Until recently, nothing was known about the type of 
              photochemical processes, rates, and steady state  concentrations of transients
              in Antarctic waters. It is  proposed that field experiments be performed which
              will  allow the construction of predictive models of photochemical  production
              rates in surface waters and with depth. These  studies will involve further
              quantum yield measurementts,  development of a sensitive underwater actinometer
              system,  and use of a new underwater multichannel photometer. The  model will
              allow the prediction of the impact of varying  levels of UV-B on the
              photoproduction and steady state  concentration of several key reactive
              transient species in  the upper water column. In addition to this effort, 
              experiments will also be performed to study the  photodegradation of dissolved
              organic matter and to  determine whether biologically utilizable substrates
              that  are formed photochemically can enhance secondary  productivity in
              Antarctic waters.
