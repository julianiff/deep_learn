Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              (CRIF) and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at University of Arizona in developing   a Chemical
              Crystallography Resource Center. The x-ray equipment purchased   for the Center
              will enhance research in a number of areas including the   following: (1) x-ray
              structure determinations of model heme complexes,   (2) design, synthesis, and
              characterization of organic crystals, (3)   synthesis and characterization of
              organic toxicants, (4) redox chemistry   of thioethers with adjacent
              carbon-metal bonds, and (5) covalently linked   oxo-Mo(V)/Fe(II)porphyrin
              centers.  The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise  
              measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule. The  
              information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond distances   and
              bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information   about the
              spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring   molecules.
