Abstract    :
              9610044  Garmire  An optical correlation system will be demonstrated operating
              at MHz level frame rates.  This high speed system will provide a practical
              optical correlation system for image processing, with potential applications in
              optical inspection and machine vision.  The proposed project leverages on
              recent developments in nonlinear semiconductor quantum well devices, and is a
              collaborative effort with Sanders' Microwave Elect
