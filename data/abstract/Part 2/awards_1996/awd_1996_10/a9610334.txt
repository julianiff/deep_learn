Abstract    :
              SEITZ, 9610334    The proposed work concerns a number of problems on the the
              subgroup  structure and representations of simple algebraic groups and finite
              groups  of Lie type.  The main problems are to complete the classification of
              the  maximal subgroups of exceptional algebraic groups, to determine pairs of 
              maximal subgroups of simple algebraic groups for which there are finitely  many
              double cosets, and to establish results on lifting representations of  finite
              groups to representations of corresponding algebraic groups.  Additional
              problems concern bounds for dimensions of weight spaces in  irreducible modules
              and a problem concerning finite groups acting  irreducibly on adjoint modules. 
                          Groups are algebraic objects that appear whenever there is symmetry
               and it is natural to study general properties of groups as well as their 
              representations.  Many problems can be reduced to the analysis of subgroups  of
              simple groups.  However, such an analysis can be extremely difficult and  is
              ultimately linked to fundamental problems in representation theory.  Seitz has
              a long standing research program aimed at systematically studying  the
              subgroups and representations of some of the most interesting families  of
              simple groups, the simple algebraic groups and their finite analogs.
