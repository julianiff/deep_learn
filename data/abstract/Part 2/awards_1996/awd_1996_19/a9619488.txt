Abstract    :
              9619488  Shaw     This project is part of the North Atlantic Regional Aerosol
              Characterization Experiment (ACE-2) which will be conducted in June and July,
              1997, over the subtropical Northeastern Atlantic Ocean as an international
              collaborative effort. The main objectives of ACE-2 are to study the properties
              of atmospheric aerosols relevant to radiative forcing and climate using
              aircraft, ship-board, and ground-based measurements.   In this project,
              measurements of the supersaturation spectrum of Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN)
              will be performed at a surface site at Sagres, Portugal. A newly developed
              instrument, the cloud condensation nuclei remover, will be deployed. The data
              obtained by this and other research groups will allow a detailed analysis of
              aerosol properties and sources.
