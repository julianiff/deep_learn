Abstract    :
               This research project involves experimental, theoretical and process
              optimization for the metal-matrix composites (MMCS).  The experimental program
              involves solidifying pre-infiltrated samples of the composite and
              characterizing the product under a range of ambient pressure and cooling rates.
              This experiment will provide information on the critical pressure required for
              defect formation as a function of the cooling rate.  A parallel theoretical
              program will be undertaken to numerically predict solidification pattern and
              porosity distribution under these process conditions.  The experimental data
              will be used to validate the theoretical model.  Finally, these findings will
              be utilized in a computational framework to optimize the casting operation for
              minimal shrinkage porosity.    It is anticipated that this award will provide
              leveraging to obtain additional funds to study continuous-fiber-reinforced
              composites, the influence of reinforcement/matrix interfacial characteristics,
              preform temperature, matrix superheat and hydrogen content on porosity
              formation, and extension of experimental technique to the fabrication of large
              castings from pre-infiltrated small components.
