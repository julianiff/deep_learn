Abstract    :
              9619160  Sandefur    This project studies the effects of family structure, more
              specifically the presence or absence of parents, and changes in family
              structure during the high schools on high school graduation and college
              attendance.  Using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Survey
              (NELS), the project follows the 8th grade students (in 1988) for five years
              (through 1994).  By 1994, these individuals have had the opportunity to
              complete high school or obtain an alternative high school certification through
              testing (i.e., Graduate Equivalency Degree--GED), and begin college.  Using
              data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the project follows
              individuals from age 13-21.  Some individuals in the samples have completed
              high school and begun college, while others have not completed high school or
              obtained a GED.  The research studies  the changes in family composition during
              this critical period in the life cycle when most individuals are completing
              their secondary educational experiences and making decisions about post-high
              school activities, and the association between these changes and the
              educational achievement of the individuals.  In addition, the research will
              explore the association of changes in family structure with five key sets of
              mediating variables:  family income, residential mobility and school changing,
              social capital, self concept and locus of control, and behavior in school. 
              Finally, the research will examine the ways in which these mediating variables
              help to account for the association between changes in family structure and
              educational attainment.  ***
