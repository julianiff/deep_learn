Abstract    :
              9619879  Rawson  This award to Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia
              University in the City of New York will provide new shipboard computers and a
              magnetometer system for use on the R/V Maurice Ewing, a 239-foot research
              vessel operated as part of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory
              System (UNOLS).  The shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist
              researchers to conduct geophysical and oceanographic studies throughout the
              world ocean in 1997 and in future years.  ***
