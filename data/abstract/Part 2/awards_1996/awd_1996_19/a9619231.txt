Abstract    :
              9619231  THOMPSON    This project will support shipboard scientific support
              equipment  for the research vessel LONGHORN a ship owned by the University   of
              Texas and dedicated to use in support of ocean science    research.        The
              Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds  for ship
              equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe    conduct of ocean science
              research. This Program provides support  for such items as deck equipment
              including winch systems for the  deployment and retrieval of scientific
              instruments, navigational  equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth
              satellite    receivers to pin point the location of research sites,   
              communication equipment including radio transceivers and    satellite
              transceivers for voice and scientific data    communications and other
              equipment such as motorized workboats    for transporting scientists to and
              from data retrieval sites.        The Project Director, John H. Thompson is
              fully qualified to    direct this project having had considerable experience in
                 overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard    equipment.      
               This project will allow the institution to upgrade the LONGHORN's  wire
              handling systems and communications.  ***
