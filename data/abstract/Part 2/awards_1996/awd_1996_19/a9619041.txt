Abstract    :
              9619041  Nelson    This five-year project, sponsored by the American Association
              of  Physics Teachers, will carry out an extensive teacher enhancement  program
              serving primarily teachers of physics in the nation's urban  areas.  The
              project will be based upon the successful Physics  Teaching Resource Agent
              (PTRA) model.  Teachers will be selected  from urban schools throughout the
              country to participate in an  intensive one-week program each summer for five
              years.  In the  program, project staff will teach teachers physics content and 
              innovative teaching strategies.  The workshops will take place just  before the
              AAPT summer meetings which these teachers will also  attend.  In each of the
              academic years of the project, these  teachers will carry out in-service
              programs with colleagues in  their districts who teach physics or physical
              science so that the  knowledge gained in the summer program will be
              disseminated  throughout the urban area.  This in-service activity will be 
              supported by project staff and lead PTRA teachers from their  geographic area. 
              Altogether, 575 teachers will be served by the  project.    Matching funds
              constitute 7% of the NSF award.
