Abstract    :
              9619022  Korf    The proposal is for WGBH to develop a library of video tapes
              and  supporting print materials to illustrate the effective application  of the
              National Science Education Standards in K-6 classrooms.   Produced under the
              guidance of a National Advisory Board the tapes  will feature an open
              exploration of what good teachers are doing  implementing hands-on, inquiry
              based instructional materials such  as FOSS, Insights and Science and
              Technology for Children (STC).    The full "Investigating Classrooms" library
              will be comprised of an  introductory videotape to orient the viewer to the
              nature and use  of the collection as a whole, three classroom tapes for each of
              4  units covering grades K-2, 3-4, and 5-6.  A taped professional  development
              session to model the use of the library will allow for  inservice training.  A
              tape giving a summary of significant issues,  focusing on the nature and the
              value of current reform efforts in  the field, will be prepared for use with
              administrators, parents  and community groups.  Companion print materials will
              include a  comprehensive guidebook which provides an overview, background and 
              analysis.  In addition tapes will be prepared for use with the LSC  Core
              Evaluation.  These tapes will cover a conversation between  experts involved in
              a discussion of ratings of classroom  observations using the instrument
              designed by Horizon Research.    The request is for $1,601,413.
