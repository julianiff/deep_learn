Abstract    :
              9619584  This project is a renewal of NSF Grant CCR-9303383 with the  same
              title. Motivated by the tremendous variety of deductive  systems of interest in
              computer science and logic, general  meta-languages for their specification,
              often referred to as  logical frameworks, have been investigated by the
              researcher  and others. Work on the previous grant includes the design  of the
              logical framework LF and the logic programming  language Elf based on LF.
              Extensive case studies have  confirmed the wide range of applicability of the
              methodology  underlying LF and Elf and also pointed towards certain 
              limitations, which this project will address. The work  includes a language for
              modular presentation of deductive  systems and meta-programs, and refinements
              of the framework  to permit subtyping, linearity, and internal equational 
              reasoning. The project will implement these language  refinements, building on
              current prototypes and the core and  module language implementations for LF and
              Elf. It will also  continue to explore the use of LF and Elf and their 
              refinements as vehicles for representing proofs of meta  theorems about
              deductive systems; that is, their use as a  meta-logical framework. A number of
              case studies under the  previous grant indicate the feasibility of such 
              representations, but more theoretical and implementation  work remains to be
              done. In longer term plans, the project  will increase the degree of automation
              of carrying out such  proofs, taking advantage of the high level of abstraction
              of  the representations and the expressive type system of LF.  ***
