Abstract    :
                    9619070  Tuthill      This project develops an electronic campus that
              offers full Masters of Science in Science Education from Montana State
              University to high school science teachers nationally.  Building on prior work
              and experience offering graduate level courses on-line, the National Teachers
              Enhancement Network (NTEN) provides content and methods courses appropriate for
              secondary science teachers with the caveat that a full Masters program,
              including an on-campus component, is also available.    The project provides
              for the development of the courses, the building of an electronic campus, and
              support for the first cohort of teachers.  Approximately 1800 teachers are
              expected to participate in courses over the life of the project.  In addition
              to a wide range of course, NTEN offers access to scientists and science
              resources, provides professional networking support, gives access to an
              electronic bookstore, and maintains close ties to the Science Education
              Standards, Headline Science Seminars and a Faculty Associates program.   Cost
              sharing is 30%.
