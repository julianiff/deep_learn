Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to accelerate the rendering of three  dimensional
              surface models using multiresolution modeling  techniques.    Multiresolution
              modeling is the description of shape at multiple  levels of detail.  In
              conventional image synthesis, an object is  rendered from the same geometric
              model independent of its screen  size, but this is unnecessarily slow for small
              and distant  objects.  With multiresolution models, nearby objects are 
              rendered using a detailed model, while distant objects are  rendered using a
              coarse model employing many fewer polygons.    To date, the creation of
              multiresolution models has been largely  manual.  New algorithms will be
              developed to adaptively simplify  polygonal surface models, attempting to find
              an accurate  approximation to the surface using as few polygons as possible, 
              and to do this as quickly as possible.  Methods for smoothing the  transitions
              between levels of detail will be developed.  The  resulting image should be
              indistinguishable from a scene rendered  from a fully detailed model.   
              Multiresolution models can speed up a number of applications,  including flight
              and driving simulation, computer aided design,  visualization, video games,
              virtual reality, and computer  animation.  They can allow scenes of great
              complexity to be  rendered in real time.
