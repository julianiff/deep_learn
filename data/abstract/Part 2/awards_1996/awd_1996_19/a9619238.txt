Abstract    :
              The PI will observe the dynamical effects of pickup protons on solar wind
              structure and shocks in the outer heliosphere; in particular, the global
              solution of the pickup proton solar wind inside the termination shock.  He will
              primarily use a system of MHD solar wind equations for the mixture of three
              species - electrons, solar wind protons, and pickup protons - and a system of
              pickup proton equations.  He can simultaneously solve the two equation systems
              numerically with an analytical solution for the distribution function of
              interstellar neutral hydrogen in the heliosphere.  Finally, he will determine
              the effects of pickup protons on the solar wind shocks jump condition, the
              interaction of interplanetary shock with solar wind structures, shock-shock
              interactions, and the termination shock location and heliopause.
