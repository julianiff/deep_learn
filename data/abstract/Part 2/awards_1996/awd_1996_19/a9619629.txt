Abstract    :
              AST-9619629    The Nonlinear Dynamics of Quasi-Collisional Neutral Gases in the 
              Solar System (A Case Study of the Triton Tori).    Dr. Marconi will carry out a
              detailed and rigorous theoretical  investigation of the physics of the Triton
              torus, a gas ring  around Neptune fed by its largest satellite.  This research 
              should lead to a realistic model of the Triton tori which will be  of use to
              other research groups interested in Triton and  Neptune's magnetosphere.  The
              project has three intertwined  objectives.  The first objective is to enhance
              in a general sense  the theoretical understanding of the nonlinear dynamics of
              quasi-  collisional gas tori in the Solar System.  The second objective  is to
              provide a specific gas model of the quasi-collisional  Triton atomic hydrogen,
              molecular hydrogen, and nitrogen tori and  evaluate their effects on the
              Neptune magnetosphere.  The third  objective is to broaden and enhance the
              study of astrophysical  gases through all kinetic regimes and to develope
              consistent  numerical schemes to describe them.
