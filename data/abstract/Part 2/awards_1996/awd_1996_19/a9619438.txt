Abstract    :
              AST-9619438    Real-Time Studies of Young Supernova Remnants: Inhomogeneities, 
              Dynamics, and the Relativistic Plasma.    Young supernova remnants (SNRs)
              provide valuable laboratories for  studying hydrodynamic and nonthermal
              processes in astrophysical  plasmas.  Drs. Lawrence Rudnick and Thomas Jones at
              the  University of Minnesota, have formed a powerful team to  investigate young
              SNRs both observationally and theoretically.  The focus is on inhomogeneities,
              instabilities, and the coupling  of cosmic rays and magnetic fields.  Prior
              work has concentrated  on the Cas A supernova remnant and its asymmetric
              dynamics.  These investigators will now obtain velocity as a function of 
              radius in various sectors of the remnant. They will explore the  relation
              between thermal and nonthermal plasmas, by looking for  connections in the flow
              structures.  =====================
