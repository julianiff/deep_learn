Abstract    :
              9619405  Vohra    The University of Alabama at Birmingham in collaboration with 
              Birmingham Southern College and Samford University will establish  a Research
              Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site for  experimental and computational
              materials research. Undergraduate  students will be recruited from the
              southeastern states, with a  recruitment focus on four-year colleges and
              Historically Black  Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The students will be
              involved  in experimental research activities which include high pressure 
              synthesis and microwave plasma processing of electronic and  optical materials;
              computational research projects include  electronic structure calculations and
              molecular dynamics  simulations. In addition, REU participants will visit
              facilities  in national laboratories and will be offered a course in 
              scientific communication.  %%%  The REU site, with a regional focus whereby
              high quality  undergraduates will be recruited from Alabama, Georgia, 
              Mississippi, and Tennessee, and with an emphasis on four-year  colleges and
              minority institutions, has potential impact on  underrepresented sectors of the
              undergraduate student population  in the sciences.  ***
