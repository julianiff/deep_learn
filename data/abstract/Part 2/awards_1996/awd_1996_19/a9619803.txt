Abstract    :
              This research investigates the relationships between information technology that
              supports  complex organizational work in critical ways, and the ensuing
              organizational and human  reliability and risk in the workplace---in this case
              hospital emergency rooms. The  project focuses on identifying
              organizational-level information and information  technology structures and
              factors that impact the level and types of errors and risks in  dynamic
              workplaces. The project will  (1) model actual technology-supported work
              systems  from the standpoint of understanding the role of information
              technology (IT) in system  and  human reliability, and examine the models to
              understand potential points of IT-related  risk and breakdown in the work
              system;  (2) use the model to predict role of IT in  contributing to errors and
              adverse outcomes;  (3) pursue documentation of patient  information as the
              locus of organizational work, by examining critical points in this  system, and
              consider ways that the technology interacts with the human work system, 
              relating this to the model and rationalizing it;  (4) refine the model
              iteratively; and  (5)  work toward preliminary tests of the models that examine
              single articulation points I  the work structures and vary aspects of the
              support technology in pilot experiments.
