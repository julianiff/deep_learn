Abstract    :
              This project follows an earlier effort that studied fifteen different
              manufacturing technologies in 1042 manufacturing plants.  The 1993 study
              developed benchmarks on technology use to help manufacturers and policy makers
              make informed decisions about manufacturing technology.  Its findings indicate
              that the skilled use of soft and hard manufacturing technologies have a
              significant effect on plant performance, measured by sales per employee and
              return on investment.  This new study updates the benchmarks and examines more
              closely the skilled use of technology.  Once again, the National Association of
              Manufacturers and Auburn University are providing significant support to this
              effort.   The study uses questionnaires and on-site interviews and observations
              to identify factors enhancing and impeding skilled use; these procedures have
              been enhanced to assure higher rates of return for the questionnaires.  The
              information provides data to model the effect of factors such as the
              effectiveness of training, training effort, technology infrastructure and the
              learning capability of the plant on skilled use.  Via a sub-contract, the
              project will also develop alternative models, including structural and neural
              models to study the collective effect of several input variables on output or
              performance variables.  The project is expected to result in publications,
              including one through The Manufacturing Institute (NAM).  The data will be
              archived at Auburn University.
