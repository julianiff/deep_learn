Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for an REU Site in program in Psychology to be
              coordinated by Saint Louis University.  The aim of the project is to provide
              research experience opportunities for selected African-American undergraduate
              students in five participating institutions (including Clark-Atlanta,
              Morehouse, Morris Brown, and Spelman.  The program involves identification of
              students in the sophomore year, preparation of research plans during the junior
              year, an intensive research experience during the following summer, and
              completion of program activities in the senior year.  Research will be
              supervised electronically and through faculty exchanges that typically will
              involve visits of 3-4 days to plan cooperative research projects and help
              students prepare for their summer activities.  In addition to involvement in
              research during the summer, students also will take a one-credit ethics course,
              present their research at a local conference, and participate in two workshops,
              one on the Graduate Record Exam and the other on careers in psychological
              science.  In the senior year, projects will be submitted for presentation and
              publication, and students will be assisted with their graduate school
              applications.  This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to
              attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate
              research experiences.
