Abstract    :
              Hope College will host an REU program for six undergraduates in  mathematics in
              the summer of 1998.  At least three of the  students will be recruited from
              outside of Hope College.   Students will work in groups of two with one of
              three faculty  mentors.  Projects will be chosen from algebra, dynamical 
              systems, probability, and number theory.    Primary goals are to help talented
              students develop as  mathematical researchers, to promote mathematics research
              as a  career, and to have the participants achieve significant  mathematical
              results in partnership with a faculty mentor.   Moreover, students will be
              encouraged to present their work at  professional meetings and in published
              form.    The program will be eight weeks.  Student pairs will be given  their
              own project or problem to solve.  After introductory  lectures given by the
              faculty researchers, students will be set  loose to tackle their own problems
              which will initially involve  reading background material and library research.
               Students will  generally meet with their faculty mentors daily.  Toward the
              end  of the project, students will write up their results and present  their
              problems and discoveries to each other.
