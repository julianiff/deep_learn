Abstract    :
              9619728  Resnick      ABSRACT      Florida International University will create
              a program to provide sixteen undergraduate students each year with a
              multi-faceted research experience, combining technical research and methods in
              industrial engineering.  Each summer, seven sophomores and juniors from
              institutions with limited research capabilities will be matched with research
              projects in manufacturing, ergonomics and operations research.  Nine students
              from FIU, three each from sophomore, junior and senior years, will participate
              during the academic year.  Three FIU students each year will also participate
              during the summer.  All student will attend seminars in research opportunities,
              methods, ethics, interpersonal skills, leadership and communication.  The
              structure of the program will support hierarchical mentoring whereby
              participants will be mentored by faculty, graduate students and other students.
               As a minority institution, FIU will stress the recruitment of underrepresented
              minorities as well as provide a diverse environment for all participants.  ***
