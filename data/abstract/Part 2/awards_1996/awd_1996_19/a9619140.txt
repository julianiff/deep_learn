Abstract    :
              9619140  Chandrasekhar   "Promoting Young Women in the Physical Sciences" is a
              sequential program spanning grades 5-12 that involves collaborations among
              teachers and administrators of the Columbia Public Schools, other area schools,
              University of Missouri faculty, local industries and parents.  A combination of
              curricular, extracurricular and training components is designed to nurture and
              broaden the participation, interest and knowledge of students, particularly
              females.   Curricular activities in the physical sciences are to be added to
              grades 5-9.  Integrated science courses for grades 9-10 are to be designed and
              implemented so all students receive additional instruction in the physical
              sciences.  Female-targeted sections of physics and chemistry are to be made
              available at the high schools.  Extracurricular programs are to be implemented
              at three levels:  the Exploring Physics after school program for grades 5-7
              girls; Saturday Science Experiences, in collaboration with local industries,
              for grades 8-9 students; and a Summer Science Academy for grades 9-11 girls. 
              The latter integrates Science, Engineering and Mathematics (SEM) disciplines
              through a toy factory building project.  Training components for parents and
              school personnel include:  physics summer institutes for teachers; a gender
              equity course followed by a semester of action research for science teachers
              and administrators; and middle school parent training through Family Evenings
              with Science and Technology (FEST).
