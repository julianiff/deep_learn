Abstract    :
                Abstract  Terzian    Cornell University will continue the Observational
              Astronomy Program  established in the Summer of 1989, in which undergraduate
              students are  involved in the research activities of the astronomy group at
              Cornell  University.  The undergraduate students will work with members of the 
              Cornell faculty and research staff on a variety of projects, including 
              optical, infrared, and radio/radar astronomy, and other related topics.  The
              students' research at Cornell will provide them the opportunity to  participate
              in astronomical observations at facilities used by Cornell  researchers, such
              as the Palomar Observatory and National Astronomy  Centers.  The students will
              be encouraged to participate in the  Undergraduate Research Forum at Cornell
              and to present and discuss  their various research projects with other students
              who are at Cornell  in the summer.  The Undergraduate Research in Observational
              Astronomy  program will continue to encourage the participation of students who
               are women or underrepresented groups and whose own institutions do not 
              provide this kind of research experience.  Special efforts will be made  to
              facilitate the logistical aspects of the student participants, such  as 
              housing and cultural activities.
