Abstract    :

              Undergraduate Computer Science Research Program : Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates    This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site
              project supports 9 students per year in programs carried out during the
              summers, for three years.  Students are recruited from smaller, primarily
              undergraduate schools throughout the South with emphasis on recruitment of
              women and minority students.  Research projects within the department from
              which the students have an opportunity to select include software testing,
              database systems, parallel algorithms, human-computer interfaces, distributed
              systems, artificial intelligence, programming languages, and performance
              analysis.  Students are required to create a formal, written report documenting
              their summer activities and, at the completion of the program, to present a
              short talk to the students and faculty of their home institution.
