Abstract    :
              9619946  Senger, Steve  University of Wisconsin - LaCrosse    REU: An REU Site
              in Applications of Computer Graphics to Medical Imaging    This Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports eight students per
              year in programs carried out during the summers, for two years.  The
              participants work in areas of computer graphics and related disciplines as
              applied to medical imaging.  Two of the students are from the host institution
              and six from other four year colleges and universities.  The research
              experiences focus on applying computer graphics, distributed computing and
              image processing to producing three dimensional images of CT, MRI and
              cryosection data obtained through the Visible Human Dataset sponsored by the
              National Library of Medicine.  A specific goal of this REU site is to encourage
              participation by women, one of the underrepresented groups in computing, and
              special recruiting efforts are planned to reach this goal.
