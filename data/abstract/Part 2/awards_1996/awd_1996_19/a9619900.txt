Abstract    :
              9619900  Chaudhary, Vipin  Wayne State University    REU:  REU Site for Parallel
              and Distributed Applications    This Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              (REU) Site project supports 6 students in the first year and 12 students in the
              second and third years in programs carried out during the summers and the
              academic years, for three years.  The students will work on projects involving
              1) programming tools for parallel and distributed systems, 2) high-performance
              solutions for scientific and engineering problems, and 3) high-performance
              solutions for medical sciences.  Substantial effort is placed on recruiting
              minority students and students from non-research institutions with at least 50%
              of the students from undergraduate institutions or community colleges in the
              Detroit Metropolitan area.  A special feature of the project is that the
              students work with industrial research mentors during their second year. 
              Student growth and the fostering of independence in research is encouraged
              through regular guidance, including weekly discussions and thorough evaluations
              of objectives and summaries of work accomplished.  A cooperative learning
              system, whereby students provide constructive criticism to improve work of
              other students, is also employed.
