Abstract    :
                9619527  Barber  The author's previous eigenvalue solutions for the problem 
              of thermoelastic distortions due to frictional contact  heating will be
              extended to the general case where the  perturbations are moving in the
              direction of sliding.  This  is relevant, for example, to the thermoelastic
              buckling and  general performance of components such as automotive caliper 
              brakes and automatic transmission clutches.  The analytical  studies and FEM
              solutions will be validated and supplemented  with input from industrial
              collaborators, one an automotive  brake laboratory and the other a manufacturer
              of automatic  transmissions.  The industrial input will be partly in the  form
              of test data and partly as knowledge transfer obtained  by having the two
              students who do their theses on the  project spend their summers as interns at
              the respective  industrial sites.  ***
