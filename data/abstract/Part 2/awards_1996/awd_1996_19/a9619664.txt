Abstract    :
                    9619644  Kachanov  Materials may contain defects that are a mixture of
              diverse shapes,  such as pores and microcracks.  The microfracturing patterns
              of the  material are strongly affected by these shape factors.  A study of  the
              interpretation of data obtained for materials with such defects  is being
              conducted.  the prediction of effective moduli and  wavespeeds from information
              of damage is done.  The microfracturing  patterns in damaged materials as
              functions of shapes and relative  sizes of damage elements are being addressed.
               Also, the  identification of signatures of the fluid presence in pores of 
              various shapes is being conducted.  Application areas include,  powder
              metallurgy and hot processing, geophysics and rock  mechanics, behavior of
              porous materials, etc.  ***
