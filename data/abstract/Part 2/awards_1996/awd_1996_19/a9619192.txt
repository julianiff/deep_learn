Abstract    :
                      ABSTRACT       This proposal is for the development of a numerical
              method that treats time as the fourth spatial dimension.  Preliminary results
              obtained under a SGER grant demonstrated accurate and stable results for sample
              heat transfer problems.  Because the effect of numerical ill-conditioning is
              removed by time-collocation, this new method is particularly suitable for
              solving inverse problems where boundary conditions are usually not known.  The
              proposed work scope involves establishing a set of global basis functions that
              can be used to expand the time envelop.  The goal is to develop the method to a
              point that it can be used to solve a variety of direct and inverse heat
              transfer problems.
