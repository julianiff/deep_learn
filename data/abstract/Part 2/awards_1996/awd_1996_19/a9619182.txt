Abstract    :
              9619182  Hansell  This award to Bermuda Biological Station for Research, Inc.,
              will provide a new CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) instrument, a new
              pressure sensor, and other instrumentation for use on the research vessel
              Weatherbird II, operated as part of the University National Oceanographic
              Laboratory System research fleet. The shared-use instrumentation supported here
              will assist ocean researchers conduct studies in the North Atlantic Ocean in
              1997 and in future years, and will be especially useful in maintaining an
              ongoing time series of ocean property measurements at sites near Bermuda for
              studies of global change.  ***
