Abstract    :
              9619256  Gangopadhyay  Carbon nitride films will be grown using two growth
              techniques, capacitive discharge chamber (CDC) growth, and plasma enhanced
              chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).  These films will be characterized in an
              extensive study of their physical properties.  Growth using CDC is a novel
              approach, and promises significant potential for producing crystalline B-C3 N4
              films.  ***
