Abstract    :
              AST-9619186    Submillimeter Polarimetry.    Instrumentation recently developed
              by Dr. Roger Hildebrand at the  University of Chicago has made it possible to
              observe the  polarization of the submillimeter wavelength emission from 
              interstellar clouds at more points and with better precision and  spatial
              resolution than has been possible before.  Dr. Hildebrand  will now exploit
              this capability by using the instrumentation at  the California Institute of
              Technology Submillimeter Observatory  in Hawaii to make maps of polarization in
              several types of  interstellar clouds.  The primary goal is to infer the shapes
              of  the magnetic fields in these objects.  A secondary goal is to  investigate
              the mechanism that aligns the dust grains responsible  for the polarized
              emission.  ==============================
