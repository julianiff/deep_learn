Abstract    :
              Undergraduate Research Experience in Mathematics will provide a  unique
              opportunity for undergraduate students to get involved in  research in
              dynamical systems, Algebra, and statistics.  In  dynamical systems,
              participants will investigate stability,  ergodicity and chaos of simple one
              dimensional nonlinear maps as  well as piecewise linear planar maps.  In
              Algebra, students will  investigate monoids determined by Linear Diophantine
              equations.   In statistics, they will study regression models using the norms 
              l_1 and l_infinity and some statistical models for genetic  linkage.  Although
              the tools and techniques needed are of  elementary nature and accessible to the
              students, the problems  involved are far from being completely understood by
              active  researchers in the field.  Hence this research program will be 
              challenging and exciting to all the participants.  Through  computer
              experimentation, students will explore and make  conjectures about the
              mathematical theory.  Then they will be  asked to prove it analytically if
              possible.
