Abstract    :
              AST-9619230    Stellar Abundances in the Galactic Center.    Dr. Kristen
              Sellgren will initiate a study of the chemical  evolution history in the
              dust-obscured center of the Milky Way  galaxy.  A two-pronged approach will
              combine high resolution  infrared spectra of 30 Galactic Center stars with
              moderate  resolution infrared spectra of more than 200 Galactic Center  stars. 
              The goal of the project is to test recent ideas that  inflowing gas from the
              disk of the Galaxy fuels sustained star  formation in a central zone of
              molecular gas which is within a  radius of 200 parsecs of the Galactic Center.
