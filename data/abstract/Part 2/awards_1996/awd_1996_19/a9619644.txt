Abstract    :
              9619644  Kamin  The goal of this project is to promote technology transfer from 
              the functional programming community into the wider programming  community, by
              concentrating on special-purpose functional  languages. The proposed work
              focuses on the design and  implementation of a functional language for ASCII
              file  processing, tentatively called FPERL. This addresses the goal in  two
              mutually-reinforcing ways. First, FPERL is to be a functional  alternative to
              languages like AWK and PERL;  its development will  shed light on this domain
              and will, it is hoped, garner a user  community of new functional programmers.
              Second, the construction  of the FPERL processor will be based on a unique
              class of special-  purpose languages: meta-programming languages (also called 
              program generators). The components of the processor - lexical  analyzer,
              parser, de-sugarer, and so on - will each be written in  a functional
              meta-programming language specially designed for  that type of component. These
              meta-programming languages will be  developed as extensions to FPERL, resulting
              in an unusual boot-  strapping process. This research will produce new
              knowledge about  a variety of special-purpose language domains - file
              processing,  parsing, and so on; about meta-programming as a generally 
              applicable programming methodology; and about the design of  languages to
              support meta-programming.  ***
