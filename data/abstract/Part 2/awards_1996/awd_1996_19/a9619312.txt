Abstract    :
              ECS-9619312  Wollenberg    There Is a looming crisis in power engineering
              education, which if not addressed, will leave the nation with far too few
              engineers with adequate training to run the nation's power systems.  This
              crisis is fueled by revolutionary changes in the power industry, declining
              student enrollments, and the lack of resources for curricular reform at
              universities.    The future employment picture for engineering graduates in
              power-related areas is very promising and encouraging.  A carefully crafted
              partnership between universities and the electric power industry, with a small
              investment of funds from the government can meet the unique technical human
              resource needs of the electric power industry that is vital to national well
              being.  At the University of Minnesota, we have been studying the restructuring
              of our power engineering curriculum.  In response, a nine-point initiative is
              proposed whose components are listed below.    1. Early (high school - college
              freshman) elicitation of student interest.  2. Broad-Based Power Engineering
              Education.  3. A major revision of undergraduate core courses in power
              engineering.  4. Innovative Hardware and Simulation Laboratories.  5. New
              Graduate-Level Courses.  6. Industrial Participation.  7. Continuing Education
              (Life-Long Learning) for Practicing Professionals.  8. Development of
              Educational Material and Plans for Dissemination.     9.    Periodic Evaluation
              of our Program by Outside Experts.
