Abstract    :
              Sensor  based  planning incorporates sensor  information  into  a  robot's
              planning process, in contrast to classical planning which  assumes   the  robot
               already  has  full  knowledge   about   its  environment.  Many classical
              planners are complete, in that  they  can  find a path in finite time or
              determine no such path exists.  Most  sensor  based planners are heuristic
              algorithms  that  work  well  in  a  variety  of  environments, but  have  no 
              proofs  of  correctness  to guarantee a path can be found. Furthermore,  they 
              have no thresholds for when the heuristics fail. Typical complete  sensor 
              based planners do not consider real world issues such  as  sensor error.
              Moreover, they assume sensors have unlimited  range  and  infinite  resolution.
               The purpose of this  research  is  to  include  ``real  world''  issues into 
              a  complete  sensor  based  planner.   Such real world issues include dead
              reckoning,  sensor  limitations,  and  sensor  error.  This  research  will  
              exploit  properties  of  a  geometric  structure,  termed  a  roadmap,  to 
              consider  these issues. Although current work uses mobile  robots  as  a 
              test-bed, the results of this work can also be applied  to  highly articulated
              robots.
