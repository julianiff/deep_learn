Abstract    :
              9619875  Zedler  Conservation biologists focus on protecting biodiversity and
              ecosystem management, yet there is little understanding of the linkage between
              the numbers of species present and how an ecosystem functions. Recent
              experiments demonstrate that where more species are present, biomass is higher,
              more nutrients are retained, and drought resistance is greater. Unanswered are
              questions regarding the type of species, the impacts on the most critical
              functions, and how knowledge of diversity-function relationships might be used
              to improve habitat restoration efforts. An unusual opportunity exists to
              facilitate field experimentation with salt marsh vegetation in the Tijuana
              Estuary in southern California and to make the results of these experiments
              relevant to restoration ecology. A new restoration site, a salt marsh plain,
              will be excavated in 1996 at the Tijuana River National Estuarine Research
              Reserve. Experiments designed to investigate the effects of species richness
              and composition on ecosystem function will be conducted at this site. Results
              from these experiments will then be directly applied to the restoration
              project.   The test of how species richness affects ecosystem functioning
              relates directly to the basic conservation tenet that diversity matters. Beyond
              this, the work will have an impact on restoration ecology. Determining whether
              monospecific types or specific combinations of species provide desired
              ecosystem functions will suggest tools for accelerating nitrogen accumulation.
              The importance of restoration for purposes of sustaining southern California's
              biodiversity is indicated by the magnitude of mitigation funds being required
              to restore coastal wetlands. Furthermore, locating the field experiments in the
              Research Reserve will facilitate follow-up studies of long-term community
              dynamics, including colonization by other plant and animal species.
