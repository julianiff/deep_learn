Abstract    :
              The program is designed to bring together 8 very bright  undergraduates from
              colleges and universities throughout the  country, where there is little or no
              opportunity for  undergraduate research.  Participants will be given an 
              opportunity to learn how to do research in mathematical and  computational
              sciences and they will be involved in numerical  linear algebra and parallel
              computing research projects.    Activities include instruction and laboratory
              experience in  numerical algorithms for linear algebra, parallel programming 
              languages, learning how to use a multicomputer (32-processor  Intel iPSC/860,
              network of SUN workstations using MPI programming  environment), literature
              review, design of parallel algorithms  and their implementation on the
              multicomputer, presentation of  research results.    The program this summer
              begins May 30, 1997 and lasts 8 weeks.   The participants may continue on their
              research when they return  to their home institutions and prepare a paper for
              presentation.   In the past, students have made presentations at UMR, a
              national  undergraduate research conference, and at the Annual Argonne 
              Symposium for Undergraduates.
