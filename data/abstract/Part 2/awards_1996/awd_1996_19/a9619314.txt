Abstract    :
              This project will determine the origin of microcrystalline  carbonate in
              stromatolites:  is it precipitation resulting from  bacterial metabolic
              activity, or physical trapping of resuspended  particles?  Crusting and "soft"
              mats from Exuma Cays, Bahamas, will  be compared, with experimental
              intervention to encourage or inhibit  lithification.  Analyses will include
              structure and mineralogy of  grains, structure of microbe community, mat
              physiology, and  biogeochemistry of stable isotopes and extracellular
              secretions.
