Abstract    :
              9619044  Taylor       This grant provides funding to purchase shipboard, 
              shorebased and mooring  instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The 
              shipboard  instrumentation will be used aboard the R/V Moana Wave, a  213 foot
              vessel,  which is owned by the Navy and operated by the University in  support
              of  oceanographic research. Instrumentation requested includes a  spectrometer,
               CCD camera, an acoustic command encoder and transducer, a  display monitor, 
              slip ring assemblies and a cable hotsplicer. The  instrumentation is requested
              for  support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the Moana Wave during  1997.
