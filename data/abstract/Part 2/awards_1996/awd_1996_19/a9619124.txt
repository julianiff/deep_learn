Abstract    :
              This  project proposes an environment to provide up-to-the-minute  briefings  on
               topics  of  interest, linking  the  user  into  an  integrated  collection of
              related multimedia documents.   On  the  basis  of  a  user profile or query,
              the proposed system  filters  multimedia   information  to  match  the   user  
              interests   and  automatically  generates  a  summary  of  the  set  of  
              matching  documents  to  provide the user with an overview of the  relevant 
              information.   The system also provides a representative  set  of  images  or 
              video that match user interests as well as  hypertext  links into the documents
              themselves. The user can follow up  with  multimedia  queries  to  refine the
              search  for  related  images,  video,  or  additional  articles. The  research 
              has  three  main  components:  summarization, multimedia search  and 
              manipulation,  and   event   tracking.   Results  will   provide   advances  
              in  summarization   using   language  generation   over   information 
              extracted  from  multiple live sources  of  news,  in  multimedia  search  and 
              classification over compressed images  using  visual  features,  and  in 
              tracking  of  events  by  detecting   surface  differences  between  documents.
               Research will  also  result  in  technologies to aid a user in tracking
              multimedia information  in  specific news domains, reducing the number of
              documents end users  such as journalists must access.
