Abstract    :
              ***  SRI  is  investigating the properties of human  interactions  with  a 
              graphical terrain model as they would  occur  in  a  crisis  situation, with a
              particular emphasis on elucidating  the  process  of  reference  through 
              natural  language  and  gesture.   First,  the research team is augmenting 
              existing  theories  of discourse salience to account for how  entities  are 
              introduced  through the visual display in  addition  to  speech,  and 
              extending theories of reference resolution  by  incorporating mutually
              constraining effects of gesturing and  properties of linguistic referring
              expressions.  Second, the  team is studying how discourse structure is affected
              by  the  structure  of  the  terrain model  and  of  the  task  being 
              executed, and how it can be determined through a combination  of  speech and
              gestural cues.  Third, they are studying  how  spatial terms are used in
              uniquely identifying referents  in  a  terrain  model, particularly with
              respect to perspective-  relative relational terms.  The data used are
              generated from  a  set  of wizard-of-oz sessions with an existing multimodal 
              route-planning  system.  The results  of  the  research  are  demonstrated in
              proof-of-concept extensions to this  system,  and  are measured by a systematic
              set of evaluation methods.  This research carries out the first step toward the
              flexible  integration of speech, gesture, and visual display that will  be 
              required by the interactive, multimodal systems  of  the  future.***
