Abstract    :
              9619799  Gilligan     The Savannah State University and Harbor Branch
              Oceanographic Institution collaborate   on a 9-week-long "Bridge to Research"
              summer program that is designed to give minority   students, at an early stage
              in their undergraduate education, an entry-level exposure to   research.  The
              students are teamed with mentors, participate in visits to marine  
              laboratories, go to sea on research training cruises, and complete condensed
              college   courses in experimental design, statistics, and technical writing. 
              Students put these skills   to use in a group research project.  Exposing
              students to minority role model mentors and   to a wide variety of professional
              situations have been key elements of the program and will   continue during
              this funding period.
