Abstract    :
                                         Abstract  9619733  Lyons  This project will make use
              of data from several spacecraft,  ground-based optical sensors and ionospheric
              radars to study  the dynamic response of the Earth's magnetosphere to 
              variations in the solar wind.  In particular the CANOPUS  chain of meridian
              scanning photometers, the SuperDARN (Dual  Auroral Radar Network) and the Sonde
              Stromfjord ionospheric  radar will all be used to monitor the precipitation of 
              particles from the inner edge of the magnetospheric plasma  sheet, thereby
              determining its ionospheric footprint as a  function of time.  The position of
              the plasma sheet further  from Earth will simultaneously be monitored by the 
              ISTP/POLAR and HEO spacecraft.  The dynamical behavior of  the plasma sheet
              will then be correlated with the solar wind  magnetic field and plasma
              parameters as measured by the  ISTP/WIND, ISTP/GEOTAIL and IMP-8 spacecraft.   
              This project contributes to the National Space Weather  Program.  ***
