Abstract    :
                This award provides continued support for the International Secretariat and
              core operations of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP).  The
              IGBP was established in 1986 by the international Council of Scientific Unions
              (ICSU) in order to facilitate international collaborative research that would
              describe and understand the interactive physical, chemical, and biological
              process that constitute critical parts of the total Earth system and the
              changes that occur within and among those components.  The IGBP sponsors seven
              core projects, each of which addresses a scientific question of major
              importance for an understanding of global biogeochemical cycles.  These core
              projects include studies of atmospheric chemistry, ocean biogeochemistry,
              coastal zone processes, terrestrial ecosystems and land use, biospheric aspects
              of the hydrologic cycle, and past global changes.  The IGBP also supports
              international data and information management activities, and it co-sponsors
              the Global Change SysTem for Analysis, Research and Training (START).  Through
              this award, NSF will provide three years of funding for continued support of
              the IGBP on behalf of all agencies participating in the U.S. Global Change
              Research Program.  U.S. support is matched by contributions from more than 40
              other nations.
