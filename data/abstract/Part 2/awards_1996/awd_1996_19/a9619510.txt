Abstract    :
                Carlton Pryor  Theodore Williams  Rutgers University  FY97:  $183,000 For 36
              months.    Kinematics of Stellar Systems:  Mass Distributions, Stellar 
              Populations, and Binary Star Frequencies.    Drs. Pryor and Williams, at
              Rutgers University, will study  the mass, structure, stellar content, and
              dynamical  evolution of stellar systems.  The basic goals are to better  define
              the properties of the first generation of stars to  form in our Milky Way
              galaxy and to search for dark matter  in star clusters and galaxies.  These
              researchers will  measure very large samples of stellar radical velocities as 
              the observation technique for this study.  The award  includes funding for
              involving undergraduate students in the  research program.  =================
