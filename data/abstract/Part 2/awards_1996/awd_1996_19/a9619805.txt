Abstract    :
              9619805  Maxwell, Bruce  North Dakota University System    REU: Research
              Training and Collaborative Projects for Undergraduates in Computer Science   
              This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports 10
              students per year in programs carried out during the summers, for three years. 
              Students participate in a spring semester research seminar offered at the
              University and on-line via the WWW to off-campus participants.  The seminar
              covers basic research, writing, and presentation skills, and helps students to
              select an advisor and design a research project in their advisor's area of
              specialty.  The participants are selected from area universities and community
              colleges, including the five Tribally Controlled Community Colleges located in
              North Dakota.  Research areas include neural networks, computer vision, speech
              recognition, network design and simulation, human-computer interfaces, and
              application development for remote sensing tasks.  Students are able to select
              from this diverse set of topics for their summer projects.  The goal of the
              project is to provide research experiences and training to undergraduates in
              computer science, focusing on students from regional institutions where
              opportunities for research are rare.
