Abstract    :
              9619352  Pachavis    Technical  abstract: The Symposium T at the Fall96  MRS 
              meeting  will  provide   a   forum  for  the  exchange  of  ideas   on   the  
              highly  multidisciplinary topic of"Glasses and Glass Formers".  The topics  to 
              be  discussed  are 1) the liquid-glass transition, 2)the  relationship  between
              the structure and the properties of glass-forming liquids  and  3)the 
              relationship between the properties of supercooled liquids  and  those  of the
              corresponding low temperature glasses. NSF support  will  provide  financial 
              assistance  to postdoctoral  research  associates,  junior faculty members and
              their students.  %%%  Non-technical abstract: The Symposium T at the Fall96 MRS

              highly  multidisiciplinary topic of"Glasses and Glass Formers".  The Symposium 
              will  bring  together the major scientific contributors in the  highly 
              multidisciplinary  field  of  research  to  discuss   the   ubiquitous 
              properties  of  supercooled  liquids and  their  relationship  to  the 
              properties  of  the corresponding glasses.  NSF support  will  provide
