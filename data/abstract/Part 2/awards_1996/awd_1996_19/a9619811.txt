Abstract    :
              9619811  Dixon    The Department of Physics and the Center for Laser and
              Photonics  Research at Oklahoma State University will establish a Research 
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in the area of optical  materials and
              lasers. The nine student participants will be  involved in projects that
              include crystal growth and  characterization of experimental and theoretical
              laser physics.  Emphasis will be placed on recruiting women and ethnic 
              minorities. Following the summer research activities, the student  participants
              will present the results of their work at the  National Conference on
              Undergraduate Research.  %%%  The REU project at Oklahoma State University will
              introduce  outstanding students at a formative stage in their careers to the 
              growing area of lasers and optical materials.  ***
