Abstract    :
              This institute is operated under the auspices of the Department of Mathematical
              Sciences and the Center for Nonlinear Analysis  at Carnegie Mellon University. 
              The institute is a seven-week summer program for undergraduate students. 
              Minority and female students are targeted for recruitment into the institute. 
              The primary goal of the institute is to prepare students for and interest them
              in pursuing graduate work in applied mathematics.  Secondary goals are to
              acquaint students with modern application areas of mathematics and to give them
              some understanding of the work involved in studying in these areas at the
              graduate level.  The institute has operated successfully since 1992 under this
              format.
