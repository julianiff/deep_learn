Abstract    :
              9619026  Lanza    In each of three years, the Arkansas-STRIVE Teacher
              Enhancement  Program places fifty 7-12 grade mathematics, science, and computer
               teachers into on-going research programs at universities, national 
              laboratories, national forests and other research institutions for  8-weeks
              during the summer.  To facilitate transfer to the classroom  teachers are
              expected to develop three Lesson Plans, to be used in  the Fall semester, based
              on the STRIVE experience.  This is  complemented by "Knowledge Transfer"
              meetings where they study  curriculum change for local schools and develop a
              STRIVE Team  Curriculum Change Report for their principal.  Additional
              follow-up  to facilitate transfer of the research experience to the classroom 
              is done through a 1-day STRIVE alumni workshop and participation in 
              4-mini-workshops.  The Arkansas-STRIVE program is a collaboration  among
              Arkansas business and industry, the University of Arkansas-  Little Rock, the
              Arkansas SSI, and the Arkansas Department of  Higher Education.
