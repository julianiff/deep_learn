Abstract    :
              Alperin   9619727        The principal investigator will continue to develop his
              approach to the  structure of endo-permuation modules, especially with a view
              to the   question of the rank of the Dade group and the question of lifting
              from  characteristic p. He, together with Linckelmann and Rouquier, will
              proceed  with their work on putting the whole approach of Puig on a
              module-theoretic  basis. Jointly with G. Mason, he will apply the complexity
              theory of   modules to Lie type groups. The idea of a clique, generalizing the
              concept  of a block, will be developed and some results from homotopy theory
              will  be put in an algebraic concept and generalized.      The field of group
              theory is the mathematical theory of symmetry and interacts with many other
              disciplines,for example physics and chemistry outside of mathematics, coding
              theory,  number theory and geometry inside mathematics.The investigator?s
              particular area is   finite groups and representation theory which is the
              interface between   group theory and linear algebra. It is a hundred year old
              subject but   still facing great unsolved problems and with many opportunities
              for  breakthroughs.
