Abstract    :
              9619277  Liu  The principal objective in this grant is to develop  theoretical
              understanding of polyelectrolytes.  Specifically  there are two related
              components of this  project:  One  involves further development of a
              variational formalism to  study the chain structure of a polyelectrolyte
              solution at  arbitrary concentrations.  This is in contrast to past work  on
              the polyelectrolyte chain structure which has been  limited to a single chain,
              in the infinite dilution limit.  The second part  is an application of this
              formalism to  study counterion condensation.  The principal advantage of  this
              theory is that  it can treat fluctuating, intrinsically  flexible chains and it
              does not require restriction to fixed  model geometries such as line charges
              and cylinders.  This  work is expected to resolve some of the most
              controversial  questions in the field of polyelectrolyte solutions and also 
              pave the way for similar studies of even more complex  systems such as charged
              self-assembled surfactant systems,  polyelectrolyte complexes, and
              polyelectrolyte/membrane  complexes.  %%%  In this grant to a young female
              researcher in theoretical  polymer science, there is support to study
              properties of  polyelectrolytes.  These are the polymers that are soluble  in
              water, generally found everywhere and especially relevant  to
              environmentally-benign processing.  The work in this  project addresses some
              long standing questions in the  structure of charged polymers and their
              response to further  charging at fairly high levels.  This work uses 
              sophisticated, state-of-the-art, theoretical machinery and  proposes to further
              build on the PI's recent development of  necessary mathematical techniques.
