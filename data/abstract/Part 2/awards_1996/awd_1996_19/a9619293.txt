Abstract    :
              This project continues a long-term effort in the area of language  learning,  a 
              problem of great scientific and applied importance.  The   same formalisms that
              are used to describe natural languages  such  as English are being applied in a
              wide range of areas  from  physics  to  biology  enhancing  the  general 
              applicability   of  results.   A characteristic of these language-like
              formalisms  is  that  their  learning takes place on both a structural 
              syntactic  plane  and a semantic plane, and these are both integral  to  the 
              system.  Although this research started from first principles  in  biology, 
              linguistics  and computation, intermediate  results  of  practical importance
              are being produced.  The research now  seeks  to  overcome some of the
              limitations that have been uncovered  in  the   original   problem 
              formulation,  using  a  more   utilized  previously.  A  new  approach to
              meaning representation  involves  active  components,  in combination with the
              more  static  visual  scenes  previously used.  If successful, this continuing 
              project  will  provide the first scientifically coherent theory  of  human 
              concept  formation  and language learning that  covers  the  full  range of
              essential issues.
