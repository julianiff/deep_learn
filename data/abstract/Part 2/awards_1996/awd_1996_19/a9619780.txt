Abstract    :
              OCE 9619780  Haidvogel    The project will investigate the dynamics of flow over
               submarine canyons using a combined physical and numerical  modeling approach.
              The models will be designed to study the  interaction between barotropic,
              oscillatory currents in a  stratified fluid and a submarine canyon interrupting
              an  otherwise smooth shelf-slope topography. The nature of time-  dependent and
              mean fields, flow separation at the canyon  edge, and mass transport in the
              vicinity of the canyon will  be investigated. The idealized approach will be
              extended to  the modeling of specific canyons for which field data are 
              available.
