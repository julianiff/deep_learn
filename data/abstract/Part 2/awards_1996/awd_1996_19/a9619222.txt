Abstract    :
                  Hybridization measurements made with phylogenetic group-specific probes for
              bacterioplankton ribosomal RNAs have shown that several major bacterioplankton
              groups form highly stratified populations in the lower ocean surface layer in
              the northwestern Sargasso Sea.  Other studies at the same site have uncovered
              evidence of a seasonal cycle in which dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
              accumulates in the upper surface layer during the vernal period and is exported
              to the lower surface layer during winter mixing.  This study proposes to
              examine the relationship between the composition of bacterioplankton
              communities and the source, amount and lability of DOC in the water column by
              conducting seawater culture experiments that combine water and inocula from
              different depths.  High-resolution electropherograms of amplified ribosomal RNA
              genes will be used to survey community composition.  Electropherogram results
              will be confirmed by hybridizations of total community RNA to phylogenetic
              group-specific probes.  Data from this study will be compared to ongoing
              measurements of bacterioplankton production, biomass and DOC that are a part of
              the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series Study.
