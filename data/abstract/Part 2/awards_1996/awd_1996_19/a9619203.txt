Abstract    :
              The project will provide a new examination of postwar American science by
              focusing on the national laboratory system. The national labs continue to
              occupy a central place in the American scientific landscape. This project will
              examine the path they have traveled and how it was chosen.  Specifically it
              will focus on  the history of the national laboratory system during the tenure
              of the Atomic Energy Commission,  in order to shed light on the implications of
              systemicity and the negotiation of research programs among the labs. The
              project will integrate two approaches.  An overview will place the national
              laboratory system in its historical context, describe its evolution, and
              address general issues about the system.  Within this overview, three case
              studies will exemplify the workings of the system for different aspects and
              different periods.  In particular, the case studies will shed light on the
              implications of systemicity and the negotiation of research programs among the
              labs.
