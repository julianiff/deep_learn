Abstract    :
              ECS-9619363  Tao    This proposal describes a university-industry collaborative
              research project to explore a new area of adaptive control: adaptive control of
              sandwich nonlinear systems, and to solve some long-standing and wide-range
              control problems of urgent relevance to theory as well as applications.  The
              proposed research will focus on adaptive control of sandwich systems with
              linear and nonsmooth nonlinear dynamics and on adaptive control of two-layer
              systems with smooth and nonsmooth nonlinear dynamics.  Typical nonsmooth
              nonlinear characteristics are dead-zone, backlash, hysteresis, other
              piecewise-linearities as well as frictions which are the main sources of
              component imperfections in control systems.  The proposed adaptive inverse
              control approach employs an adaptive inverse to cancel the nonlinearity effects
              in order to achieve system performance improvements.  This approach points to a
              new direction to design control systems using a new algorithm-based technology,
              which, after a period of learning or adaptation, can recognize component
              imperfections and compensate for their harmful effects.  With such adaptive
              controllers, the component specifications could be greatly relaxed, their cost
              reduced, and their reliability increased.  The results of this research will
              advance the knowledge of adaptive control significantly, provide new tools to
              effectively handle practical nonlinearities which have haunted the constructors
              of control systems for many years, and have many applications in defense and
              civil industries in which high-precision control systems are vital components.
