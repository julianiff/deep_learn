Abstract    :
              9619401  Dawson    ABSTRACT      The ten week Clemson Electrical and Computer
              Engineering Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) program will be
              composed of ten undergraduate researchers and over ten faculty mentors involved
              in individual research projects and professional development activities. 
              Research projects are available in the following areas of research:
              Computational Electromagnetics, Digital Signal Processing, Wireless
              Communication, Mechatronics, Electronics, Power Systems, and Computer
              Architecture.  The professional development activities will consist of
              seminars/workshops on technical writing, oral communication, graduate
              education, academic careers, industrial careers, and professional ethics.   
              Each student will be required to present a mid-program oral presentation on the
              progress of their research.  At the end of the summer, the student will
              participate in a poster session, prepare a written report and an extended
              abstract, and present an oral presentation on their research.  Faculty-student
              interactions will be enhanced through a number of activities including five
              informal lunches highlighting presentations on research and graduate studies in
              electrical and computer engineering.  ***
