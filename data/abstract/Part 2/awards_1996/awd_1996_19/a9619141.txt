Abstract    :
              9619141  Lerman    This project, sponsored by Columbia College of Chicago, will
              carry  out a five year project to teach teachers in grades 7, 8 and 9 in  50 of
              Chicago's public schools the basics of physical science using  up-to-date
              pedagogical technoques with exemplary materials.  Each  year of the project 40
              new teachers, selected from 10 of the 50  participating schools, will be
              selected and will take an intensive  three-week summer program, followed by 16
              after school sessions and  two Saturday sessions during the schol year. 
              In-class and in-  school assistance will be provided in subsequent years to aid
              in  the classroom implementation of the materials.  At the end of the  project,
              in most of the target schools, all teachers who teach  science in a given
              school at the grades selected will have been  involved in the program.  A
              parallel program for parents, not  funded by NSF, will support what is being
              done in the classroom.   Parents will become knowledgeable of the science
              activities done by  their children and be involved in a science literacy
              program.    Matching funds constitute 182% of the NSF award.
