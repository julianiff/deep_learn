Abstract    :
              9619201  Bock    This award supports research aimed at an integration of two 
              technologies which have proven useful for monitoring motion of the  Earth's
              crust. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is currently  capable of measuring
              baselines (the distance between two GPS  receiver location points on Earth)
              with a precision in the  millimeter range at distances of hundreds of
              kilometers.  Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (INSAR) cannot offer a 
              comparable level of precision, but has the advantage of being able  to measure
              relative motion of the crust over a continuous area (as  opposed to a limited
              number of discrete points on the surface).  Combining the two approaches will
              provide greatly enhanced  capabilities for understanding such phenomena as
              earthquake related  motion (pre-, syn-, and post-seismic), volcanic activity,
              plate  tectonic motions, groundwater movement, and other local and  regional
              crustal strain processes. The research is a collaboration  among geoscientists
              at the University of California, San Diego,   Stanford University and the
              University of Hawaii. The approach by  the collaborators will be: (1) to reduce
              the so-called orbital or  baseline error of INSAR by deploying radar reflectors
              or  transponders at selected GPS receiver sites and thereby pin down  the
              precise locations of those points to serve as anchors for the  INSAR
              interferometry, and (2) use meteorogical models and satellite  data to reduce
              the error in GPS locations due to the effect of  water vapor in the atmosphere.
