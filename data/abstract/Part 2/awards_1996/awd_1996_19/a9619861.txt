Abstract    :
              9619861  Berque, David  DePauw University    REU: Research Experiences in
              Computer Science for Students at Undergraduate Institutions    This Research
              Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports 9 students per year
              in programs carried out during the summers, for three years.  Participating
              students are grouped into three research teams each comprised of three students
              and one faculty mentor.  The students work on projects involving robotics,
              pen-based computing, and modeling of file system performance.  They have full
              access to the computing facilities of the University including specialized
              equipment such as a laser operated white board which supports one of the
              projects.  Activities include conducting research as part of a team,
              disseminating results, and participating in a community of scholars. 
              Substantial effort is placed on recruiting students underrepresented in
              computing, particularly women, and students from non-research institutions. 
              Participants have normally completed their sophomore or junior year of college
              and are majoring in computer science.
