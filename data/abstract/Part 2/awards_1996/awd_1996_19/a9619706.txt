Abstract    :
              9619706  Clark    ABSTRACT      The National Nanofabrication Users Network
              (NNUN) is a national partnership of research facilities providing unparalleled
              opportunities for researchers from many disciplines and organizations to
              fabricate structures utilizing advanced nano- and micro-fabrication technology.
               Initiated by NSF in 1994, NNUN is serving as a useful model for linking
              expensive facilities to gain synergy and minimize duplication.    NNUN proposes
              establishment of a network-wide REU program.  The intent is to capitalize on
              the extensive, interrelated infrastructure of NNUN to provide a much broader
              and richer REU experience than any one site could provide.  The proposed
              program will build upon several existing enrichment programs existing at
              various NNUN sites.    By expanding the program, we expect to strengthen and
              enrich the REU experience in several ways:    * With the geographical spread
              embodied with NNUN, we will be able to contact and attract a broader range of
              minority/female students.    * The pool of faculty will increase by a factor of
              3-4.  This should enable a better match between student and faculty interests. 
                * The REUs will be exposed to various aspects of "networking" across large
              geographical distances, an experience likely to be important in their careers. 
                * We will offer a convocation at the end of the program which will provide a
              majority of the students with a "2 site" experience.    ***
