Abstract    :
              9619084  Lindgren    This three year project includes 5-weeks of a mentored
              research experience and a 2-week workshop to help translate the research
              experience into improved classroom instruction.  In year-1 ten three-teacher
              teams, of physics and physical science (middle and high school) teachers, join
              scientists at the University of Virginia, Jefferson National Laboratory and at
              six other Virginia sites for the research experience.  The workshops to
              facilitate transfer to the classroom will be done at the University of
              Virginia-Charlottesville.  In year-2 this cohort will continue their work and
              be joined by a new cohort of 30 teachers.  Teachers may earn 8-graduate credit
              hours for both summers through the University of Virginia-Charlottesville.  An
              important feature is the field supervisor who will track and keep in constant
              contact with teachers during the summer and academic year to facilitate
              transfer back to the classroom.  The pedagogy and leadership workshop component
              will prepare teachers to conduct workshops for their peers, improve computer
              networking skills, and construct apparatus to facilitate transfer of the
              research experience back to the classroom.
