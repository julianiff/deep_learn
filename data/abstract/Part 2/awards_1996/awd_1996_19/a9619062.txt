Abstract    :
              9619062  Wagreich    The Chicago Secondary Mathematics Improvement Project is
              designed  to help Chicago Schools:    * implement Chicago's new graduation
              requirement of three years of  high school level mathematics;  * provide a
              quality mathematics education for all students; and  * align curriculum and
              teaching practices with city, state and  national goals and assessment
              practices.    The vehicle for attaining these goals is the Interactive 
              Mathematics Program (IMP) - the first of five NSF supported high  school
              comprehensive mathematics curriculum projects to be  completed.  The proposed
              project will provide a broad professional  development program for teachers who
              work in schools that have  elected to implement the IMP curriculum.  The
              project will work  with 200 teachers in approximately 15 Chicago public high
              schools  over three years to assist schools with IMP implementation.  Spring 
              and summer workshops and in-school support during the academic year  are
              essential components of the project.  The development of  teacher leadership
              and a plan for providing long-term support  beyond the funding period of the
              grant are also included.    The project is grounded in the experience and
              practice of three  years of successful, NSF-supported pilot IMP implementation
              in  Chicago and builds upon on work that began in 1990 as part of the  College
              Preparatory Mathematics Program, a project that with  partial NSF support, led
              to increases in student achievement and  persistence in mathematics for African
              American and Hispanic  students in Chicago.
