Abstract    :
              9619969  Greene  This award to San Jose State University Foundation will provide
              a new echosounding system for use on the research vessel R/V Point Sur,
              operated by Moss Landing Marine Labs as part of the University National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The shared-use instrumentation
              supported here will assist ocean researchers conduct studies in the North
              Pacific Ocean in 1997 and in future years, and will be especially useful for
              studies along the California margin.  ***
