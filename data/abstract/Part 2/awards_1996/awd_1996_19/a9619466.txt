Abstract    :
              Rosenfeld  9619466    The characteristics of the internal waves and turbulence 
              field in Monterey  Submarine Canyon will be measured with a suite of  vertical 
              fine-scale and  microstructure  profilers and shipboard instruments to test 
              the hypothesis  the energy flux of up-canyon  propagating semi-diurnal 
              internal waves is lost  to turbulent dissipation and mixing. Also of interest
              are  the shape, level  heterogeneity and anisotropy of the vertical wavenumber 
              spectrum on the  fine-scale (wavelength 10-50 m) as compared to that found in 
              the open  ocean. Finally, the turbulence measurements will be used to  assess
              the  importance of canyons to mixing at boundaries.
