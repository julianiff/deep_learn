Abstract    :
              9619910  Reactive systems such as telecommunications systems, and  aircraft
              navigation systems interact continuously with their  environment and are
              usually safety critical. This has  created a demand for a rigorous framework
              for reasoning  about their correctness. Traditional formal methods for 
              ensuring system reliability perform a static analysis where  a high-level
              design is verified using techniques such as  theorem proving and model
              checking. Since actual systems are  much more complex than the verified
              abstraction, static  analysis is supplemented by testing and monitoring of the 
              implementation. This project will introduce rigorous  paradigms for the
              monitoring of reactive systems and use  them along with static analysis
              techniques to obtain  mathematical guarantees on the correctness of system 
              behaviors. It aims to extend two paradigms --- program  checking, which seeks
              to follow up each computation of a  program by a check that proves that the
              result is correct,  and conformance testing, which seeks to determine if an 
              implementation is correct by observing its input-output  behavior --- to the
              context of reactive systems. The project  will also explore distributed
              monitoring of distributed  reactive systems.  ***
