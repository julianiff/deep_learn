Abstract    :
              AST-9619418    A Survey of Nearby Stars for Extrasolar Planets.    Drs. Steven
              Vogt, Geoffrey Marcy, and Paul Butler will use the  Keck I telescope in Hawaii
              and the HIRES spectrometer on that  telescope to carry out an initial 2-year
              reconnaissance program  to survey about 400 nearby stars for giant planets. 
              With this  system they have already proven they can reach a precision of 3  m/s
              with their Doppler technique to provide detections of Jupiter-  mass planets
              within 5 Astronomical Units of the parent star.  Refinement of the Doppler
              analysis will enable detection of  Saturn-mass planets at 5 Astronomical Units
              from the parent star.  =================================
