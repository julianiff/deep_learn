Abstract    :
              9619007  Loucks-Horsley    This project will develop a National Academy for
              science education leadership, in collaboration with six major leadership
              organizations.  The Academy program will enhance the knowledge, skills, and
              strategies of current leaders of science education reform with positions in
              NSF-funded and other federally-funded projects and systemic initiatives, in
              school districts, state departments of education, professional associations,
              and other organizations.      Each year of the four-year project, 30 leaders
              will began an intensive two years of collaborative study, professional
              development, and networking.  Program content will include change management,
              science content, organizational and professional development, and facilitation
              skills.  Follow-up activities will include mentor programs, study groups and
              other ways to keep Fellows connected to reform networks and each other.
