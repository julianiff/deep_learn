Abstract    :
              This award provides support to the American Economics Association for an REU
              Site program housed at the University of Texas at Austin.  A primary objective
              of the program is to increase the number of minority students in the economics
              profession.  Ten students will be selected for an eight week training program
              to strengthen their analytic skills and to demonstrate the relevance and
              excitement of economics as a profession.  Hands-on empirical research
              experiences and honors level coursework will be central features of the
              program.  Students will be given ten broad topic areas from which to design
              projects, and appropriate data sets will be made available for each area. 
              Weekly workshops or seminars by outside speakers will familiarize students with
              policy issues and career options.  This award contributes to the Foundation's
              continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through
              active undergraduate research experiences.
