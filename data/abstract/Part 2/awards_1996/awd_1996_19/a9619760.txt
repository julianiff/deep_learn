Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for an REU Site in Archaeology hosted by Davidson
              College.  The program provides instruction in archaeological research methods
              to students joining the Athienou Archaeological Project in Cyprus.  Ten
              students will (1) receive instruction in survey and excavation techniques,
              record keeping and data management, and artifact analysis; (2) participate in
              seminars taught by experts on archaeological method and theory and the cultural
              history of Cyprus; (3) visit prehistoric and historic sites on Cyprus; (4) plan
              and complete an independent research project; and (5) live in Athienou and
              learn about life in modern Cyprus from the villagers.  Students will master the
              methods of archaeological field research, including new `high-tech` approaches
              to data collection and analysis, and gain a better understanding of
              archaeological theory.  This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing
              efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active
              undergraduate research experiences.
