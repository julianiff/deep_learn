Abstract    :
              9619413  Stone    This project will establish a Research Experience for 
              Undergraduates Site at Utah State University with the theme being  the
              Principles and applications of nonlinear dynamics.  The site  will run through
              the 8 week summer sessions of 1997, 1998, and  1999.  The primary objective is
              to show young scholars the power  of mathematical thinking in understanding
              their surroundings by  taking advantage of the broad spectrum of problems of
              interest to  the interdisciplinary community of researchers in nonlinear 
              dynamics at Utah State University.  The site will also make  available a very
              unusual research opportunity for  students of the Western region of the United
              States.
