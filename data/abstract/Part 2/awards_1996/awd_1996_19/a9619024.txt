Abstract    :
              9619024  Haase    This three-year project, sponsored by North Carolina State 
              University, will enhance 120 teachers of science and technology in  the rural
              part of the state.  Middle school teachers will be  recruited from economically
              disadvantaged school districts in  Eastern North Carolina and will attend a
              three week summer  intensive institute followed by academic year workshops and
              a one-  week "refresher course" in the next summer.  Participants will be 
              trained in the use of new computer based technologies to teach  physics and
              chemistry particularly the use of MBL and CBL in the  classroom.  In addition,
              equipment, which is sometimes cost  prohibitive for the schools, will be lent
              on an as-needed basis  from the University.  Also, teachers will be trained to
              take  advantage of, and submit proposals to the "School Technology Fund"  which
              is being made available by the state to encourage schools to  use computers and
              laboratory equipment in the schools.  Teachers  will be sensitized to the
              philosophy and practice of hands-on and  inquiry-based learning, learn to
              address the needs of a diverse  student population and enlist the aid of
              teacher mentors (trained  from a previous NSF project) who will help in the
              implementation of  the technology component of the program as well as the new
              content.   A web site will be developed to enable teachers to discuss with one 
              another and with project staff issues related to the implementation  of these
              new techniques in the classroom.  The award is being  matched by funds
              equivalent to 36% of the grant.
