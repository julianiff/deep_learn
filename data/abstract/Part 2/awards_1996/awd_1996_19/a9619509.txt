Abstract    :
              9619509  Silliman    ABSTRACT      This proposal seeks an NSF Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates Site in the Department of Civil Engineering and
              Geological Sciences at the University of Notre Dame.  The site will be focused
              in mitigation/reduction of natural and man-made hazards.  The NSF support for
              10 undergraduate students each year will allow them to become involved in the
              research activities of the faculty of the Department during the summers of 1997
              through 1999.  This experience is designed to provide students with an improved
              understanding of research and to encourage them to consider careers in
              research.  Support for this REU site will supplement the commitment of the
              Department to such research activities, and provide students with the
              opportunity to participate in ongoing cutting-edge research projects.  The
              research activities span the areas of expertise of the faculty in Civil
              Engineering and Geological Sciences and include projects in water resources,
              bioengineering and pollution control, and structural mechanics.  Components of
              the program include identification of exceptional students through nationwide
              recruitment with emphasis on women and minority participation; matching of
              student research interests with faculty; close interaction of graduate students
              and faculty with the undergraduates to provide students with a fuller
              appreciation of graduate study, university research, and careers in academia;
              an intense two month research experience; and a mini-conference for
              presentation of results.  The goal of the program is to excite some of the best
              engineering students in the nation about the challenges of a career in
              research.  ***
