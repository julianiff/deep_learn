Abstract    :
              9619048  Lapp    The National Science Resources Center (NSRC) has developed a
              one year planning process to initiate, support, and prove the viability of
              regional development sites as described in the proposal, Capacity Building for
              Science Education Reform.  Two regional science education reform sites will be
              initiated during the planning year.  Each site will be composed of a coalition
              of 7 - 15 neighboring school districts, representing about 3000 teachers from
              100 - 150 schools.    These regional sites will work together to develop and
              sustain comprehensive professional development programs for all K - 8 teachers.
               These programs will be designed to impact the "core educational practice" of 
              participating districts, that is how teachers understand the nature of science
              knowledge and the student's role in learning, and how these about knowledge and
              learning are manifested in teacher practice.    Specifically, NSRC will work
              with regional sites by developing and beginning a planning process (Alabama and
              South Carolina have agreed to become sites) to: (1) identify participating
              school districts; (2) develop a master plan for professional development; (3)
              identify resources to establish an electronic network; and (4) develop a plan
              for obtaining needed resources.
