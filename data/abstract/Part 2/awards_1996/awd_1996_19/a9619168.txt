Abstract    :
              9619168  Robinson    A secondary school implementation program is established
              for the five comprehensive mathematics instructional materials development
              projects funded by NSF.  These projects are: Applications/Reform in Secondary
              Education, Consortium for Mathematics and its Applications; Core Plus
              Mathematics Project, Western Michigan University; Interactive Mathematics
              Program, San Francisco State University; Math Connections, Connecticut Business
              and Industry Association; and Systemic Initiatives for Montana Mathematics and
              Science, University of Montana.  The structure incorporates a central
              coordinating site together with five satellite sites, one for each project. 
              The central site informs various constituencies about these innovative
              curricula, aids school districts in the first general phases of implementation,
              and coordinates requests for additional information and assistance.  The
              satellite sites assist in the development of successful implementation
              strategies which are project specific and tailored as much as possible to the
              implementation locale and assists schools in employing these strategies.  A
              listserv and Web site are maintained for distributing information and
              coordination is maintained with various systemic initiatives supported by NSF.
