Abstract    :
              ECS-9619785  Dawson    The active magnetic bearing (AMB) is a non-contact means
              of supporting a rotating member such as a motor or pump shaft.  That is, an AMB
              system can be used as a substitute for standard mechanical contact supports,
              such as rollers or ball bearings.  The AMB offers several important advantages
              over conventional mechanical bearings which can lead to improvements in a large
              variety of devices (e.g., possible rotating machine systems include electric
              motors, electric generators, gasoline or diesel engines, jet engines and
              turbines, fan, blowers, etc.).  Specifically, AMBs:  I) are not subject to
              frictional losses, ii) can be used to compensate for rotor unbalanced, iii) can
              operate in both high and low temperature environments, and iv) eliminate
              contamination associated with lubricants and friction wear.    The project will
              be mathematical modeling and control algorithms and the associated software and
              hardware modules for high precision control of large gap AMBs and for the
              demonstration of their corresponding applications.  Specifically, the proposed
              research will bring recent advances in nonlinear theory to an emerging
              technical area which could spawn a potentially large export market for U.S.
              manufactures.
