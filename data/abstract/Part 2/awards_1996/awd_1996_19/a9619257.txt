Abstract    :
              ECS-9619257  The Energy Systems and Control (CESAC) at Howard  University is
              dedicated to research in Power Systems for Utility  and Government foundations
              and outreach programs called EESI for  High School Students, with emphasis in
              Electrical  Engineering/Power Systems, and Artificial Intelligence 
              Applications.  We are proposing to extend these outreach  activities to include
              High School teachers in the Washington, DC  Metropolitan area.    These
              teachers will serve as a conduit for exposing a critical  mass of students as
              to why Power Systems education and career is  important.    The proposed work
              is aimed at a two-week summer outreach program  emphasizing the following:   
              (a)  Energy alternatives, economics consideration and modeling.     (b)  Basic
              Power System components and tools needed for analysis       and design.    (c) 
              Use of internet for problem solving in an engineering course       such as
              Network Analysis.    The extended EESI Program for teacher will spread over two
              (2)  weeks and will involve lectures, discussions and hands-on.  The  Principal
              Investigator (PI) and a graduate student in Power  Systems will be involved in
              the course delivery.    The experience obtained from this workshop will be
              documented in  an IEEE Power System Education Division paper.  ***
