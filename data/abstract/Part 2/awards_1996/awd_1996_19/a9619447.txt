Abstract    :
              The  objective  of this project is to develop  a  robust  set  of  algorithms 
              for  automatically learning admissible  heuristics  -  that   is,   functions  
              that  identify  optimal   solutions   to  combinatorial problems and give a
              lower bound on the actual  cost  of  a  solution.  The more accurate the
              heuristic  function,  the  more  efficiently  an optimal solution can be 
              found,  or  if  an  optimal  solution is not required the more quickly  a 
              lower-cost  solution  can found.  This research is developing ways  to  learn 
              these  heuristics in a domain-independent manner  by  applying  a  technique 
              that has proved useful in automatically learning  more  accurate  admissible
              heuristic functions that take more  time  to  compute,  but  make  up for it in
              the time  they  save   for  the  algorithm  using  the heuristic.  This work
              will  provide  better  solutions  of  combinatorial problems of artificial 
              intelligence  which will be increasingly cost-effective as computers get faster
               and larger problems are presented for solution.
