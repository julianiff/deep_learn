Abstract    :
              9619638  The research proposed focuses on algorithmic aspects of  programming
              language theory and pragmatics, continuing the  research agenda of the
              principal investigator. Further  investigation is targeted on the area of
              optimal evaluation  for lambda-calculus, concentrating on relevant cost models,
               the necessity of and possible improvements to bookkeeping  for sharing, with
              applications to linear logic and game  semantics. A long-range goal is to
              investigate optimal  evaluation as a possible implementation technology for 
              functional programming. In addition, work will be continued  on syntactic
              approaches to parametricity and reasoning about  polymorphic programs based on
              their types, on fixed-rank  type inference, typed lambda-calculus as a venue
              for  capturing complexity classes, and intensional properties of  contraction
              of proofs to programs as a general technique for  program synthesis. Some of
              the work will also be relevant to  curriculum development, even at the
              undergraduate level.  ***
