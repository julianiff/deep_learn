Abstract    :
              9619885  Hoffmann  This is an award to provide support for research on use of 
              titanium dioxide as a catalyst in a photocatalytic process for  treatment of
              aqueous and gaseous waste streams to reduce their  pollutional impact on the
              receiving environment.  The goal of  this project is to determine whether the
              rate of the  photochemical reaction can be significantly increased in aqueous 
              heterogeneous media to levels comparable to those obtained in  application of
              the photocatalytic process to gas-phase waste  streams.  The research is
              designed to address the fundamental  basis for this apparent discrepancy by
              studying the reaction  mechanism using a pulsed source of ultraviolet
              radiation.  Two  hypotheses are planned to be examined.  One is that the 
              difference in reactivities between the process application to  liquids and
              gases relates to differences in the mode of substrate  adsorption on the
              surface of the aatalyst.  The other is that  water may inhibit oxygen reduction
              and/or substrate competition  for available adsorption sites on the target
              compound.  Results of this project are expected to contribute to a better 
              understanding than now exists of photochemical reactions as they  may be
              applied to decontamination of soil and water.  This in  turn is likely to
              result in improvement of the engineering design  of processes that can be used
              reduce the pollutional effect of  liquid and gaseous waste discharges on the
              quality of surface and  groundwater and to decontaminate soil.***
