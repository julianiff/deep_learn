Abstract    :
              9619340  George  Nitric Oxide (NO) is a pervasive and physiologically active 
              molecule in mammalian systems, and has recently been  detected in the exhaled
              breath of humans.  The concentration  of NO in the exhaled breath changes in
              the presence of lung  disease.  The shape of the exhalation profile reflects
              the  underlying exchange dynamics of NO in the lung, and,  therefore, can be
              used as a tool to improve our  understanding of NO exchange dynamics and
              physiology in both  normals and those suffering from inflammatory lung
              diseases.  In addition, inhaled erogenous NO holds promise as a therapy  for
              diseases such as asthma, pulmonary hypertension, and  Adult Respiratory
              Distress Syndrome (ARDS).  A gas  inhalation strategy can overcome many of the
              problems  associated with intravenous or aerosol administration of  drugs. 
              Currently, the limited information available  regarding the basic gas exchange
              dynamics of NO in the lungs  has been dominated by  experimentation with little
              attention  paid to modeling as a tool to understand the experimental  results. 
              Many inflammatory diseases afflict the smaller  airways (bronchioles) and
              alveoli which are essentially  inaccessible to direct experimental measurement.
               Thus,  theoretical modeling provides an important avenue to  understanding the
              exchange process of gases within the  airway tree,  The goals of the project
              are to 1) develop a  mathematical of endogenous NO exchange in the lungs, 2) 
              validate the performance of the model using a series of  exhalation profiles
              under a range, of breathing conditions,  3) understand the effect of
              inflammation on the exhalation  profile, and 4) develop therapeutic strategies
              for using  erogenous NO as a therapy.  The proposal is well-balanced  between
              theory and experiment, and the results will provide  fundamental information
              related NO exchange dynamics in the,  lungs that will improve our understanding
              of both normal and  diseased lungs.  ***
