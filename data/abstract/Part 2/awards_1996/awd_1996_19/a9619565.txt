Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division 
              Sandra Greer  of the Department of Chemical Engineering  of the     University
              of Maryland- College Park will continue her research   on   the nature of the
              phase transitions of polymers and  equilibrium   reversible polymerization, in
              which the monomers undergo a reversible   chemical reaction to form  polymers.
              In this project microscopic and   macroscopic experimental methods will be used
              to study the energy   changes, the structural changes, and the details of the
              approach to   equilibrium near the critical point.  The microscopic studies
              will use   neutron scattering to investigate the  structure of the solutions
              and the   motion of the polymers in them. The macroscopic studies will include 
               measurements of  equilibrium properties such as density, heat capacity,  
              phase diagrams, kinetic rate constants and transport properties such as  
              viscosity.  These studies in reversible polymerization are of relevance for  
              understanding the mechanism of polymer formation in systems of   technological
              and biological interest.
