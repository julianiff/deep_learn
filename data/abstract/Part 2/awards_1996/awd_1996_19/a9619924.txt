Abstract    :
              9619924  Schwartz    ABSTRACT      This project and REU site will provide
              support for 15-20 undergraduates from all over the country, mainly those having
              finished their junior year, to work with 26 faculty members and graduate
              students in the Electrical Engineering Department on current research projects
              within the department.  Selected graduate students will act as co-mentors. 
              Current research projects are in the areas of:  electronic materials and
              devices; photonics and optoelectronics; computer engineering; communications;
              signal/image processing.  In order to expand their exposure and experience, the
              students will also have half-day-a-week involvement with our undergraduate
              semiconductor processing laboratory, our signal processing laboratory, and a
              series of informal seminars on "current" topics in electrical engineering. 
              Ethics and the role of the technology in society will be introduced in a way so
              as these social concerns will not be seen in isolation, but rather, as an
              important component of ones professional activities.   The goal of the program
              is to increase the pool of domestic applicants to graduate study in
              engineering, and help clarify their views of the fields of engineering and
              science.  This will be accomplished by involvement in cutting-edge research and
              exposure to a variety of areas within the field of electrical engineering.  ***
