Abstract    :
                Abstract    Proposal Number:  CTS-9619232  Principal Investigator: 
              Karniadakis    This is a proposal to explore a different approach to turbulence
              modeling based on a new generalized analogy between hydrodynamic turbulence and
              electromagnetism.  The new analogy originates from the Maxwell equations, which
              completely describe the electromagnetic fields in all cases and not simply the
              induction laws, which have been previously used to develop the classical
              analogy.    The new correspondence is between vorticity and magnetic field, and
              Lamb vector and the electric field. Appropriately averaged, as in standard
              large-eddy simulation (LES) approaches, the new system leads to a linear set of
              equations, which reduces to a second-order wave equation for the locally
              averaged vorticity and Lamb vector fields.  Because of the linearity of the
              system in these variables, the superposition principle can be used to construct
              solutions for complex-geometry flows using analytical/numerical solutions in
              simpler domains.
