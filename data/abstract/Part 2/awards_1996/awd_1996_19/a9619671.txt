Abstract    :
                    Frodeman  9619671    The "Southwest Earth Studies Program" will be a 6
              credit hour, 5 week Summer program for 20  upper-division college students
              (half from the sciences, half from the humanities) from colleges and
              universities throughout the U.S.  The goal of this Program is for science
              students to grasp the philosophic (e.g., epistemological and ethical)
              implications of scientific issues, and likewise for humanities students to
              better appreciate the role scientific information can play in philosophic and
              public policy debates.  This will be accomplished by having students gather and
              evaluate data; discuss the philosophical issues surrounding the interpretation
              and use of this data; and combine this data with philosophic perspectives for
              the devising of public policy alternatives.  This will result in an increase in
              the student's capacity to critically analyze controversial environmental
              problems, thereby helping to overcome the current estrangement between the
              sciences, the humanities, and the problems of contemporary society.    Three
              controversial environmental issues will be studied in successive years: 1) the
              effects of dam projects on ecosystems and communities, (the Animas La Plata dam
              project); 2) the scientific and social issues surrounding the extraction of
              energy resources, (coal-bed methane); and 3) scientific and ethical problems
              surrounding the extraction and control pollution from mineral resources (acid
              mine drainage.)
