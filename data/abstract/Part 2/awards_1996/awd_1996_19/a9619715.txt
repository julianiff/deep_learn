Abstract    :
              9619715  Barnicki    ABSTRACT    This REU program, has several important
              objectives including a) exposing more undergraduate students - both external to
              MSOE and internal - to the fascinating technological opportunities made
              possible through Solid Freeform Fabrication, b) contributing real research
              results and publications in a field which vitally needs to understand and
              improve materials, processes and applications, c) examine opportunities in
              photonics, biomedicine and manufacturing and d) successful recruiting of women,
              minorities and disabled undergraduate students.  In turn, this will
              significantly enhance these students' knowledge, experience, professional
              growth and confidence; it also is expected to be a major factor in their
              retention and has increased the likelihood of their going to graduate school.  
               Undergraduate students will be recruited for both summer and academic year
              research, with target numbers of 3 during the academic year, growing to 8
              during the summer, at least 30-40% being non-MSOE students during the summer. 
              These students will work with other undergraduates and graduates in this
              vigorous and exciting Center of Excellence.    To ensure the continual
              improvement of the REU program, a periodic evaluation effort will be carried
              out in two ways: a) self evaluation of project activities by the student
              participants in the REU program and b) evaluation by a team that will include
              faculty members associated with the REU projects.  The project director will
              use these faculty researchers to ensure the success of the REU program.  ***
