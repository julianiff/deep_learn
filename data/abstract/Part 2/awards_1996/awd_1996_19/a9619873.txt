              Abstract  ATM-9619873  Zielinski, Gregory  University of New Hampshire    Title:
              Initial Development of an Interdisciplinary Data Base for  the Evaluation of
              Volcanism-Climate Linkages    To reliably assess the impact of volcanism on the
              atmosphere and  specifically on climate change over annual to decadal time
              frames  requires the compilation of appropriate information on the global 
              distribution of volcanic aerosols, the resulting optical depth of  those
              aerosols, and evidence of the climatic impact of the eruptive  products. 
              Attaining this goal requires the establishment of a data  base that can resolve
              these parameters.  Several different sources  are able to provide this type of
              information including: ice core  records of volcanism, tree ring records of the
              climatic impact of  volcanism, geologic deposits and records of atmospheric
              phenomena  related to the atmospheric loading of aerosols.  This SGER award 
              supports the initial development of a multiparameter data base to  include
              information from all of these sources thereby providing  a  thorough
              compilation of the climate forcing capabilities of  volcanism.
