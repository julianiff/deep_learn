Abstract    :
              9619366  Moyer    The Linked Learning in Mathematics Project (LLMP) is a
              thirty-month Teacher Enhancement leadership and dissemination project that
              provides supportive infrastructure and resources for:  validation and
              refinement of an Algebraic-Thinking Framework for mathematics teachers of
              grades 6-9, and leadership development for the purpose of bringing about
              systemic mathematics reform.  LLMP builds on the work of the Urban Mathematics
              Collaboratives (UMC) and its derivative NSF-funded Teacher Enhancement
              projects, Assessment Communities of Teachers (ACT) and Leadership for Urban
              Mathematics Reform (LUMR).  LLMP holds promise for its contributions in
              addressing the difficulties faced by districts implementing "algebra for all"
              policies.    This partnership between Marquette University and the Milwaukee
              Public Schools provides for participants to be recruited/selected in school
              teams comprised of mathematics teachers of grades 6-9 and their principals. 
              For the first cohort of LLMP, priority is given to teams that are piloting
              NSF-funded instructional materials.  The project provides 109-126 hours of
              professional development for each of 110 teachers of mathematics and 34 hours
              for each of approximately 20 principals.      In addition, the project refines
              and validates an Algebraic-Thinking Framework intended to guide instruction
              based on NSF-funded and other reform-oriented instructional materials in
              mathematics.  An end product of the project is to be a publication "that
              captures the Algebraic Thinking Framework and offers guidelines for its use"
              and that will be disseminated nationally.     Non-federal cost-sharing in the
              project is approximately 34% of the NSF contribution and is derived from
              Marquette University ( 4%) and the Milwaukee Public Schools (29%).
