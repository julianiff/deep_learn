Abstract    :
              Concurrency control and recovery are essential components of transaction
              systems. Whereas much  research has gone into concurrency, resulting in a
              wealth of results integrated into a fairly mature  theory, recovery has
              remained limited to mostly implementation-specific knowledge. This is
              undesirable for  technical and economic reasons: lack of a model of recovery
              precludes meaningful comparisons between  alternatives, in terms of their cost
              and functionality, and forces the reinvention of basic abstractions  and the
              adoption of ad-hoc approaches. Motivated by these inadequacies and by the need
              to support recovery  for applications such as information retrieval, workflows,
              and mobile computing this project is  developing means for specifying the
              recovery requirements of an application, identifying the recovery  abstractions
              and protocols needed to realize complex recovery requirements, working toward
              the modular  construction of recovery based on standard abstractions and
              protocols, developing ways to demonstrate the  correctness of this
              construction, and enumerating the tradeoffs involved in implementing given
              recovery  requirements. All of these facilitate the adjustment of recovery to
              changing infrastructure support and  application requirements. In sum, this
              project aims to enable the crafting of efficient and correct  recovery, in the
              conventional and advanced transaction realms, thereby influencing the way
              emerging database  applications can be supported.
