Abstract    :
              9619086  Carraher    For educational research to enlighten and lend inspiration
              to science and mathematics teaching, it must be accessible, comprehensible, and
              engaging. This has been difficult to achieve through printed journals and
              books. Teachers and researchers themselves commonly find research publications
              dry, unclear, and removed from their personal experience. Recent developments
              in computer and video technology promise to greatly facilitate dissemination of
              research among educators and researchers. Research  "articles" that take
              advantage of multimedia capabilities can be produced and read on widely
              available computers. Such articles can include, for example, video footage of
              students solving problems or discussing issues. The video sequences can be
              integrated with hyperlinked transcripts, analyses by experts, remarks by other
              viewers, including educators, and links to related topics.    The present
              project will produce a two research articles that exploit new presentation
              possibilities afforded by advances in multimedia. Once completed, they will be
              made available on a web site where they can be evaluated by mathematics and
              science educators in terms of its comprehensibility, richness, and potential
              uses. The project will undertake discussions with researchers, teachers, and
              commercial publishers in order to evaluate the viability of creating a
              multimedia-based journal in science and math education. In addition it will
              host at TERC a conference on the uses of video technology in science and
              mathematics educational research.  ***
