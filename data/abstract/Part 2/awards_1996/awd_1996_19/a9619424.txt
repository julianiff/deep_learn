Abstract    :
              AST-9619424      Dr. Ronald Reynolds has completed the instrumentation for the 
              Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) Fabry-Perot facility and  installed it on Kitt
              Peak, Arizona.  He will now begin an  observational survey to explore the warm
              ionized component of the  interstellar medium.  The survey will significantly
              improve our  basic knowledge and understanding of the composition and 
              morphology of interstellar matter and the principal mechanisms of  ionization
              and heating within the disk and halo of the Galaxy.
