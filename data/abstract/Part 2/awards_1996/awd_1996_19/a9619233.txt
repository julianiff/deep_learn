Abstract    :
              Since  its introduction by Reiter in 1980 default logic  has  been  widely 
              studied  for  its potential as a knowledge  representation  mechanism. Recent
              results indicate that default logic not only can  serve as a declarative
              knowledge representation tool but also  has  the  potential to evolve into a
              practical high-level computational  environment.  This  project develops fast 
              systems  for  automated  default  reasoning  including  implementations  for 
              parallel  and  distributed  environments. A systematic methodology  of 
              computing  with  default  logic  is  also  under development.  Usefulness  of 
              default  logic as a computational tool is demonstrated  through  a 
              comprehensive  experimentation with  default  theories  describing 
              combinatorial    optimization   problems.    To    support    this 
              experimentation  effort,  a tool to automatically  generate  large  families 
              of  default theories, logic programs  and  propositional  theories is
              implemented.  Due to the declarative nature of default  logic, this new
              programming tool, based on default logic, will  be  easy to use, will allow for
              fast prototyping and will be effective  in  a  wide  range  of artificial
              intelligence  applications.  The  testing  system  will  become  a standard 
              benchmarking  tool  for  automated reasoning based on default logic and related
              formalisms.
