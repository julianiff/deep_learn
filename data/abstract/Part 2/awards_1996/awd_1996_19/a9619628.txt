Abstract    :
              AST 9619628    Collaborative Project:  Galactic Stellar Populations: Chemistry, 
              Kinematics, & Chronology.    Dr. Bruce Carney, University of North Carolina,
              and Dr. John  Laird, Bowling Green University, will carry out a three part 
              observational project relevant to the study of the structure of  our Galaxy. 
              The first part is to study the relationship between  the thick and thin disks
              of the Galaxy by analyzing three old-  star samples, each of which has more
              than 1000 stars.  The second  part is to study the outer disk by obtaining the
              ages and  compositions of stars in the southern Galactic warp.  The third  part
              is to study abundance patterns in stars with composition  differences among
              representative halo stars.  ========================================
