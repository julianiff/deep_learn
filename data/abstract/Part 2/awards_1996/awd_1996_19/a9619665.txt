Abstract    :
              9619665  Paterson    ABSTRACT      The proposed three year project provides
              opportunities, stipends, and support for ten undergraduate students to be
              involved in ongoing research projects each summer in the Environmental
              Engineering Program at Michigan Technological University.  The project intends
              to recruit students who: (1) are under-represented in the field (minorities and
              women), (2) are undergraduates at other institutions, and (3) may not have
              opportunities to conduct research at their undergraduate institutions.  Student
              participants will be between their junior and senior years with the purpose of
              motivating the students to pursue graduate education.  The program will
              include: (1) a research project that is a self-contained part of a larger
              project, (2) mentoring by a project faculty and graduate student, (3) regular
              project meeting, (4) a weekly seminar series covering many aspects of
              environmental engineering and graduate student life, (5) weekly educational
              tours to provide first-hand contact with environmental problems and solutions,
              (6) a community project to foster teamwork and social awareness, (7) a final
              report written by the undergraduate researcher, and (8) a concluding symposium
              to provide all participants and the public to learn from the student research
              presentations.  Research will be in all areas of environmental engineering;
              atmospheric systems and air pollution control, surface water quality and water
              resources, environmental systems modeling, pollution prevention, environmental
              chemistry, wastewater, solid waste and hazardous wastes, and groundwater and
              subsurface remediation.  Faculty and students will be paired according to the
              interests of student and faculty, needs of the faculty, and abilities of the
              student.  ***
