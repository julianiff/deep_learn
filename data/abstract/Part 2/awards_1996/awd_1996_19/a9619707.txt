Abstract    :
              9619707  Cook  The Savannah State University and Harbor Branch Oceanographic
              Institution collaborate  on a 9-week-long "Bridge to Research" summer program
              that is designed to give minority  students, at an early stage in their
              undergraduate education, an entry-level exposure  to research.  The students
              are teamed with mentors, participate in visits to marine  laboratories, go to
              sea on research training cruises, and complete condensed college  courses in
              experimental design, statistics, and technical writing.  Students put these 
              skills to use in a group research project.  Exposing students to minority role
              model mentors  and to a wide variety of professional situations have been key
              elements of the program and  will continue during this funding period.
