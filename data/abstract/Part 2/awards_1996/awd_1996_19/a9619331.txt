Abstract    :
              9619331  Anseth  The object of the proposed research is to develop a new  class
              of degradable polymers that is photopolymerizable and  exhibits the desired
              mechanical properties (particularly as  the sample degrades) necessary for
              musculoskeletal  applications.  This work is important in developing new 
              strategies to restore structural and mechanical function to  bone that has been
              fractured by traumatic injury, or  surgically removed because of disease or
              tumor formation.  There is a great need for polymeric materials that are safe, 
              degradable and strong for use in musculoskeletal  applications.  Development of
              a photopolymerizable system  may be beneficial for many reasons including fast
              curing  rates at room temperature, spatial control of the  polymerization, and
              complete ease of fashioning and  flexibility during implantation.  These
              benefits have led to  advanced in dentistry, opthamology, and adhesion
              prevention,  but currently no orthopedic systems have been designed. 
              Photoinitiation could greatly simplify the clinical  application of orthopedic
              polymer implants.  For example, in  pin applications a viscous, liquid monomer
              could be  introduced into a pin hole and the system photopolymerized  in situ
              to render a hardened polymer of the required  dimensions.  In situ
              polymerization eliminates the need for  shaping the implant with blades, buffs,
              and warming  instruments.  Additionally, the process provided a faster  and
              better mechanism for replicating complex shapes and  should improve adhesion of
              the polymer implant to the bone.  Bone fractures are a major health concern in
              this country.  Recent studies of musculoskeletal conditions in the United 
              States estimate over 2 million fractures annually which more  than 280,000 are
              hip fractures.  Numerous musculoskeletal  applications would benefit from the
              development of safe,  strong, easily fashioned, and degradable polymers.  ***
