Abstract    :
              A group of eight undergraduate students will conduct  independent research at
              the Bermuda Biological Station for  Research for a time period of three months
              each fall.  The  topics of these research programs will be in the fields of 
              oceanography and marine biology.  Each student will be  assigned to a faculty
              mentor whose interests match those of  the student.  The research program will
              begin with a two  week orientation phase that involves lectures on a wide 
              range of subjects, followed by an eight week laboratory  and/or field research
              phase.  At the end of the program, the  students will present the results of
              their research at an  REU symposium modeled after a scientific meeting.
