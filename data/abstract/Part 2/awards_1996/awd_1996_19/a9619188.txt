Abstract    :
              9619188  Weingartner  This award to University of Alaska at Fairbanks will
              provide new water sampling instrumentation, shipboard computers, and other
              instrumentation for use on the research vessel Alpha Helix, operated by
              University of Alaska Institute of Marine Science as part of the University
              National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The shared-use
              instrumentation supported here will assist ocean researchers conduct studies in
