Abstract    :
              9619831  Query-based visualization is put forth as a novel  exploratory approach
              to understanding distributed  computations. The key features of the approach
              are the use  of queries as a device for searching the state space of 
              distributed computations, visual presentation techniques  borrowed from program
              animation, and the ability to navigate  through the state space using visual
              interactions. Query-  based visualization treats the state of a running 
              distributed computation as if it were the contents of a  distributed database.
              The user explores this database by  issuing queries which are evaluated and the
              results  visualized. A class of queries called persistent enable  continuous
              visual monitoring of the state of a distributed  computation. All views
              correspond to globally consistent  snapshots of the computation. The project
              will produce the  first implementation of query-based visualization which will 
              provide a uniform interface for learning about distributed  applications that
              employ the PVM library. In the course of  development, contributions will be
              made to monitoring and  snapshot algorithms, graphical representation forms and
              ways  to combine them, and the visual query language.  ***
