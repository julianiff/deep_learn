              Abstract  ATM-9619035  Wellington, George M.  University of Houston  Title:
              Patterns of Climate Change in the Central and Eastern  Sectors of the South
              Pacific    Isotopic and chemical tracers within coral aragonite can accurately 
              record seasonal and interannual changes in environmental parameters  such as
              sea surface temperature (SST), salinity, rainfall, nutrient  availability, and
              river input.  Corals provide the only means to  accurately reconstruct tropical
              ocean surface conditions at high  temporal resolution.  Analysis of
              satellite-derived monthly sea  surface temperatures show that large scale
              oceanographic events,  such as ENSO, register a significant signal in the
              central and  eastern South Pacific region and indicate that corals from the
              Cook  Islands and Easter Islands may be suitable for reconstructing  long-term
              climate records to: 1) relate interannual climate  variability over a large
              global scale, 2) identify the frequency  and magnitude of pre-historic ENSO
              events and, 3) evaluate  potential evidence of anthropogenic influence with
              respect to  observed recent warming of the troposphere.  This SGER award 
              supports a project to collect several multi-century long cores from  massive
              coral colonies at Cooks and Easter Islands.  Initial stable  isotope analyses
              will be conducted at subannual resolution on the  upper (recent) portion to of
              the core.  By comparing these results  with instrumental SST data we can
              accurately assess the potential  for developing long climatic time-series
              reconstructions from these  regions.
