Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is the development and implementation of  parallelizable
              numerical methods for solving matrix Riccati  equations that arise from large
              control problems.  One effective  and widely used approach to their solution is
              via the computation  of the stable invariant subspace of an associated
              Hamiltonian  matrix.  Existing methods have one or more drawbacks: limited 
              parallelizability, lack of structure-preservation, numerical  instability, or
              slow convergence.    In this project, new Jacobi type algorithms for
              Hamiltonian and  other structured eigenproblems will be developed.  Existing 
              structure-preserving Jacobi algorithms suffer from poor  convergence: they use
              2x2 symplectic-rotations, which limit the  positions on the off-diagonal that
              can be targeted for  annihilation.  By exploiting the correspondence between
              4x4  matrices and the tensor square of the quaternion algebra,  this proposal
              studies ways to overcome this restriction,  and develop structure-preserving
              algorithms that have better  convergence properties, while retaining numerical
              stability and  parallelizability.  The algorithms developed will be evaluated 
              for speed and stability in serial and parallel settings.  Improved parallel
              algorithms will enable scientists and engineers  to solve larger control
              problems with greater accuracy.  ***
