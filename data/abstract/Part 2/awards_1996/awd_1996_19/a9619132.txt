Abstract    :
              9619132  Ohme    Each year of this 2-year project 27-secondary school teachers
              from the Atlanta area take part in 8-week summer research experiences.  Nine go
              to Emory University and 18 go to Georgia Tech and other research partners. 
              They begin with a 3-day research skills mini-institute.  Then teachers go to
              their research sites and work with a mentor or team of mentors on a part of the
              ongoing work of the laboratory.  Midway through the summer all teachers meet to
              share research experiences and network.  This is repeated in two day meetings
              at the end of the summer and twice during the ensuing academic year.  Teachers
              are expected to develop a project applying the knowledge and processes to
              enhance their students' scientific literacy.  They apply for the program in
              teams of two or three from a school or district.  They may earn
              5-recertification credits upon completion of the summer program.  Follow-up
              work by the mentors includes at least two classroom visits during the academic
              year.  Mentors are prepared for their role in mentor orientation sessions along
              with school administrators.  The project is guided by a large Advisory Council
              which meets quarterly.
