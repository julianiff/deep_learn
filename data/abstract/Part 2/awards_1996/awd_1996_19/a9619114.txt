Abstract    :
              A  video  sequence  is  a  rich  multimodal  information  source,  including  
              speech,  text,  audio  (non-speech  portion),   color  patterns  and  shapes of
              imaged objects (reflected in  individual  frames),   and   motion  of these
              objects  (revealed  by  changes  between  frames).  Although the human being
              can quickly interpret  the  embedded  semantic content from the information 
              carried  by  different modalities, computer understanding of a video  sequence 
              is  still  in a primitive stage.  The aim of this project  is  to  develop  new
               theory  and techniques for scene  segmentation  and  classification  in  a 
              video sequence,  which  is  key  to  video  understanding. Research in this
              arena   has in the  past  several  years  focused on the use of text, speech
              and image  information.  The  proposed  research  explores  the use of  motion 
              and  audio  characteristics,  which  will  provide  important   complimentary 
              information.   New results are anticipated both  in  the  general  theory  of 
              feature analysis and classification, and in practical  techniques  for  video 
              understanding and  scene  classification.  These   new   developments  will 
              have  direct  applications   in  information  indexing  and  retrieval  in 
              multimedia  databases,  spotting  and  tracking of special events in
              surveillance  video,  video editing and movie stratification, etc.
