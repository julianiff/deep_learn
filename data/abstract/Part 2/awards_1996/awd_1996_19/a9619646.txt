Abstract    :
              9619646  Goel    ABSTRACT      The Michigan Technological University site for
              the National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program
              will provide research training for ten undergraduates selected from 18 schools
              in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota for each of three summers.  These
              undergraduates will work on designing, modeling, and experimental measurement
              of propagation delays in the Gallium Arsenide-based very high-speed integrated
              circuits - the state of the art technology for the fastest computers.  The
              project goals are to:    1.  Enhance student experience, competence, and
              self-esteem by working on a state-of-the-art research project;  2.  Encourage
              students to pursue graduate studies and a research career in electronics; and 
              3.  Improve students oral and written skills through seminar presentations and
              written reports.    The expected impact of the project is in an increased
              number of talented students choosing research careers in this field which is
              vital to the nation's technological advances.  ***
