Abstract    :
              This project will bring eight highly motivated and capable  undergraduate
              students from among the region and the nation to  the Williamsburg campus of
              the College of William and Mary during  each of the next three summers.  The
              students will spend eight  weeks experiencing mathematical research first hand,
              with close  faculty guidance.  Faculty advisors will come from William and 
              Mary's mathematics department, widely known for its research in  matrix and
              operator theory.  Students will work with faculty  mentors, either individually
              or in small groups, on research  projects in matrix theory and its applications
              that have been  chosen by the faculty for their accessibility and
              appropriateness  for well-prepared undergraduates.  During the program,
              seminars  on mathematics topics and field trips to nearby installations  that
              employ mathematicians will be provided for the students.   Informal discussion
              and interchange of ideas among students will  be strongly encouraged.  Each
              student or group will make several  oral presentations and will prepare a final
              written report.  In  the past, such reports have been the basis for scholarly 
              publications co-authored by the students and their faculty  mentors.
