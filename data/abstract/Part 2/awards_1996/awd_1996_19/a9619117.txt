Abstract    :
              ***  In  the  rapidly  emerging  area of  multimedia  information  systems, 
              effective  indexing and retrieval  techniques  are  critically  important.  In 
              this  project,  the  Center  for  Intelligent   Information  Retrieval   (CIIR)
                will   study  algorithms  and  mechanisms that facilitate  the.process  of 
              indexing and retrieving images, video, and associated  text.  Specifically, 
              the  CIIR  will:  1) Develop  techniques  for  browsing and retrieving images
              and videos by content.  Image  indexing   is  an  emerging  technology  which  
              is   poorly  understood.  New and powerful techniques will  be  developed  for 
              indexing images and videos using visual attributes such  as  color,  texture
              and 'appearance';  2) Develop techniques  for  indexing  images and videos
              using text present  in  the  images.   Methods  of  assisting with manual 
              annotation  of  images will also be studied.  The text indexing methods will 
              be   combined  using  the  INQUERY  probabilistic  retrieval  engine;   3)
              Develop and evaluate interactive retrieval  and  browsing  interfaces for
              image, video, and  text  retrieval.  These  interfaces  will be based on novel
              visualization  and  user interface work done at CIIR. The CIIR will perform
              user  studies  to  evaluate  the appeal and effectiveness  of  the  interfaces.
                 In   summary,  the  project  will   integrate  innovative image matching,
              sophisticated text retrieval  and  new query formulation and visualization
              methods to create  a  powerful platform for indexing and retrieving images,
              video,  and text.***
