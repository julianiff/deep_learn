Abstract    :
                Abstract  CTS-9619392  S.E, Pratsinis  U. of Cincinnati    A combined
              experimental and modeling investigation of the effect of  electrical charging
              on the formation of ceramic nanoparticles in flames will be undertaken.
              Experiments have shown that the particle size can be controlled within 1 nm in
              specific ranges of particle properties and flame characteristics.  Electric
              fields are created in region of particle formation at crossflow with flame
              gases, and the resulted particles are charged by using a corona discharge to
              reduce agglomeration.  In-situ Fourier Transform Infra Red spectroscopy will be
              performed to measure the temperature of gases and particles in collaboration
              with the Case Western Reserve University (Prof. P. Morrison).  The evolution of
              the particle size and structure along the flame axis will be measured using
              rapid thermophoretic sampling in collaboration with the Case Western Reserve
              University (Prof. C.M. Magaridis).  Particle and concentration characterization
              will be performed with a differential mobility analyzer, scanning and
              transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and specific surface area
              analysis.  A model including particle nucleation, surface growth, coagulation,
              sintering and charging in three-dimensional conditions will be developed. The
              home university and the Ohio State will provide matching funds in total value
              of $169,600 for this project.    If successful, this project ill provide a
              better fundamental understanding of particle formation processes in flames, a
              data base for further modeling efforts, and overall an approach to synthesise
              non-agglomerated nanoparticles at high rates and at a relatively low cost.
