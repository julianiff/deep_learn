Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funding to continue a summer REU site  in the various
              disciplines of oceanography at the University  of Rhode Island.  Eight
              undergraduates are to be recruited  from science, mathematics, and engineering
              departments  nationally to conduct research at URI.  Each student is  paired
              with a research scientist or faculty advisor, chosen  to reflect the student's
              interests and background.  The  program consists of a variety of scientific
              lectures and  discussion groups, a written report, a final oral  presentation,
              and a program of social and scientific  interactions.
