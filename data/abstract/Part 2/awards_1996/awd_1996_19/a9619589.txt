Abstract    :
              An important recent advance in prediction has been the discovery that getting
              multiple versions of a predictor and then combining these can lead to dramatic
              reductions in error rates. Examples are bagging (Breiman) and Adaboost (Freund
              and Schapire). What is not clear is the mechanism behind these reductions, and
              this is a main problem in our research. Work by Shang and Breiman show that it
              is possible to grow binary trees that have considerably lower error rates than
              trees grown the standard way, i.e. CART or C4.5.  This method uses the training
              set to estimate the input-output distribution and then uses this distribution
              to grow the tree.  More research is necessary to make it robust and efficient.
              Currently, complex medical studies are analyzed using a class of simple models
              that depend on estimating parameters in a single linear combination of the
              input variables. Another  research direction is the adaptation of the more
              general predictive methods developed in machine learning to the analysis of
              medical data. This research will result in improved prediction methods in
              combining many predictors, in growing a single binary tree, and in the analysis
              of medical outcomes.
