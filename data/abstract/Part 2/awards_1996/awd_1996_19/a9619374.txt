Abstract    :
              Abstract    9619374  Meyer  The TopHat long-duration balloon experiment is
              designed to measure the spatial variations in the cosmic microwave background
              radiation (CMBR).  It utilizes a  novel configuration of the balloon payload,
              with the telescope itself being mounted on the top of the balloon in order to
              eliminate many of the sources of systematic errors caused by the balloon's
              structures and the Earth being in the sidelobes of the telescope antenna, while
              the electronics and control equipment will be suspended below the balloon in
              the usual fashion.  The resulting map of the cosmos in five spectral bands with
              wavelengths between 0.45 and 2.3 mm, will provide unprecedented detail in the
              CMBR anisotropy over a large (1800 square degree) patch of the sky.  The
              variations in the CMBR carry the imprint of the distribution of matter in the
              early universe, approximately 300,000 years after the big bang.  The nature of
              the anisotropy can be used to sensitively test various models of the nature of
              the universe, both early-on and now; hence, TopHat will contribute to the
              resolution of such questions as whether the universe is open or closed and what
              is the nature of the missing (dark) mass in the universe.    This experiment
              will be flown from McMurdo, Antarctica.  The project is jointly sponsored by
              the Danish Space Research Institute, NASA and NSF.  ***
