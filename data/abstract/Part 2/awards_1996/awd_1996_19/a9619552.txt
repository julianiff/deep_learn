Abstract    :
              AST-9619552    Probing with Radio Pulsars.    Dr. Wolszczan will continue his
              research using radio pulsars as  probes to study extrasolar planetary systems,
              relativistic  gravitation, galactic populations of neutron stars, and the 
              physics of neutron star interiors.  Most of the observational  data will be
              collected with the two specialized pulsar receivers  constructed at Penn State
              University and mounted on radio  telescopes at Arecibo, Puerto Rico and Torun,
              Poland.  ========
