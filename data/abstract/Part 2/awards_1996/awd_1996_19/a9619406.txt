Abstract    :
              9619406  Garg    The Department of Physics at the College of Wooster will 
              establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site.  Eight students
              will be recruited from Wooster and from other  primarily undergraduate
              institutions. Students will participate  in research which includes
              experimental studies of liquid  crystals, binary fluid mixtures and polymer
              networks, and  theoretical studies in nonlinear dynamics.  %%%  The REU project
              at the College of Wooster will involve students  from primarily undergraduate
              institutions in frontier research  and will develop in the undergraduates a
              motivation to pursue  careers in science and engineering.  ***
