Abstract    :
              Mathematical REU site at the University of Tennessee    Selected Topics in Pure
              and Applied Math    Abstract    This proposal is for a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates  program for eight weeks in the summers of 1997-1999 at the 
              University of Tennessee.  Ten undergraduate mathematics majors  will work on
              research projects with faculty members and will  participate in two short
              courses and one seminar.  Two of the  ten students will work with researchers
              from Oak Ridge National  Laboratory.
