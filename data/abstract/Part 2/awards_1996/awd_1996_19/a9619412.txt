Abstract    :
              9619412  Raufaste  This award is for continued support for the U.S.-Japan Panel 
              on wind and Seismic effects which was established in 1968.  annual meetings a
              alternate between Japan and the U.S.  the  Panel develops technologies and
              strategies that advance  engineering design and construction practices.  The
              panel is  composed of 19 Federal agencies that participate in 11 task 
              committees.  the task committees focus on specific issues,  e.g., earthquake
              and natural hazard reduction. passive and  active control systems, repair and
              retrofit of structures  and wind and earthquake engineering of offshore and
              retrofit  of structures task committee workshops and conferences are  shared at
              the annual joint meeting and usually published as  proceedings.
