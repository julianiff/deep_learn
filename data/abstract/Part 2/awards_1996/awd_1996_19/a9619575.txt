Abstract    :
              AST-9619575 Bennett    A Search for Extra-Solar Planets via Gravitational 
              Microlensing.    There is great astronomical interest in the goal of finding 
              and characterizing planetary systems orbiting other stars.  Dr. David Bennett
              and colleagues will put into place an  observational program to discover
              planets orbiting other stars  by means of gravitational microlensing.  He will
              follow-up on  microlensing events initially discovered through surveys 
              conducted by other teams of observers.  Principal  observational facilities for
              this project are in South Africa,  and Dr. Bennett is collaborating with South
              African  astronomers to get the telescope properly instrumented and 
              operational for this research effort.  The Division of  International Programs
              at NSF is assisting on this award by  providing travel funds.
