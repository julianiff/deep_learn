Abstract    :
              9619501  Hotchkiss    The Zoological Society of Florida and Miami Metrozoo will
              use this  award to plan their strategy for "Attracting New Neighbors".   During
              their planning activities they will address issues involved  in attracting the
              traditionally underserved and large Hispanic  population of Dade County,
              Florida to the educational programs of  the zoo.  The planning grant will
              support 1) audience research  within Dade County, 2) a national study to see
              what others have  done to attract diverse audiences, 3) a three-day
              invitational  planning conference, 4) site visits and focused research by 
              Metrozoo staff on attracting a diverse audience, and 5)  dissemination of the
              information about marketing strategies and  programming techniques developed
              during the planning activities to  zoos and science museums across the country.
               The planning process  will culminate in the development of a long-range
              exhibition,  educational program, and marketing plan for the zoo's new
              Education  Court scheduled to open in 1998.
