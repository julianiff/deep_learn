Abstract    :
                          9619908  Bartels    The Albion College REU Site combines laboratory
              studies in the department of Geological Sciences with field research in
              southwestern Wyoming.  Each undergraduate project examines a tightly
              constrained aspect of the geology or vertebrate paleontology of the Eocene
              formations of the Green River Basin in conjunction with an on-going joint
              Albion College-University of Michigan research program.    These Eocene
              sediments and the vertebrate faunas they contain record an interval when Rocky
              Mountain basins preserved a unique combination of varied depositional
              environments and the interplay of modern vertebrates replacing those that
              appeared after the extinction of dinosaurs 65 million years ago.  The fossil
              remains of animals ancestral to most modern vertebrate groups are preserved in
              variety of ancient lake, lake-margin, meandering stream, and alluvial fan
              deposits.    Student participants, recruited from across the nation, combine
              field work and sophisticated laboratory analyses with thorough report
              preparation and presentation.  Individual investigations are selected from
              topics ranging from issues in vertebrate paleobiology to sediment geochemistry.
               In both field and laboratory phases of the project, students are advised and
              assisted by a diverse body of established scientists from a variety of
              institutions.
