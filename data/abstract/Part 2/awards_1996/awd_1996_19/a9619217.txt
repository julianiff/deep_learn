Abstract    :
              9619217  Hare   The project goals are:  (1) to create permanent changes in the
              SEM climates for students, both in the school district and in the preparation
              of teachers at our university; (2) to create hands-on learning opportunities in
              SEM at the Children's Museum and to showcase girls and women as the
              teachers/leaders in presenting these exhibits; (3) to empower participants to
              make a difference in protecting our environment, and (4) to create awareness in
              parents and teachers to make a difference in the ways we are raising and
              motivating our daughters in SEM.   A collaboration between a university, large
              public school district, and a museum in an area that has been heavily rural and
              is suddenly turning into a major tourist attraction provides many opportunities
              for unique and innovative aspects.  The opportunity to work with elementary and
              middle school girls and teachers for the past year in a NSF model project has
              motivated this more comprehensive effort with the expectation of long-term
              infrastructure change, both within the public schools and within teacher
              education and parenting.
