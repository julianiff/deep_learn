Abstract    :
              AST-9619524    Dr. Edward Olszewski, at the University of Arizona, Dr. Mario 
              Mateo, at the University of Michigan, and Dr. Heather Morrison,  at Case
              Western Reserve University will carry out a collaborative  project to map the
              outer halo of the Milky Way to search for  possible moving groups of stars
              which are likely remnants of  accretion of smaller galaxies by the Milky Way. 
              The goal is to  obtain a clearer understanding of the merger history of our 
              Galaxy, by determining the content of the halo that can be  attributed to
              accretion from small, nearby, interacting galaxies.  This is a very ambitious
              observational project that will be  carried out on telescopes in both the
              northern and southern  hemispheres.
