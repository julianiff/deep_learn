Abstract    :
              AST- 9619302    Lunar Laser Ranging at McDonald Observatory.    Lunar laser
              ranging data play a vital role within various  astronomical sciences.  They
              form a firm foundation upon  which many fundamental astronomical disciplines
              stand.  They  contribute in areas such as the solid Earth sciences,  geodesy
              and geodynamics, Solar System ephemerides,  terrestrial and celestial reference
              frames, lunar physics,  general relativity, and gravitational theory.  With
              this  award Dr. Peter Shelus will enhance the  collection of  lunar laser
              ranging data at McDonald Observatory to produce  near-real-time Earth
              orientation parameters and will develop  and implement a Baysian statistics
              based data identification  and quality control package to improve the quality
              and  efficiency of the product.
