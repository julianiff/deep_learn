Abstract    :
              Abstract  Salah et al    The Massachusetts Institute of Technology will host
              eight students  annually at its Haystack Observatory to provide research
              experiences  for undergraduates. The Haystack Observatory is a
              multi-disciplinary  research center dedicated to radio astronomical research,
              using its  37-m diameter telescope.  The facility is also used for studies of
              the  earth's upper atmosphere by taking advantage of  its 46-meter and 
              67-meter high power radars and available optical facilities.  The  students
              will be involved in the acquisition of data using the  instrumentation,
              carrying out the analysis and interpretation of the  measurements, as well as
              the development of hardware and software to  improve the capabilities of the
              facility. Astronomical studies will  involve the characterization of galactic
              radio emission sources and  star formation investigations.  Atmospheric studies
              will emphasize the  effects of geomagnetic storms on the structure and dynamics
              of the  earth's atmosphere, spectral studies of periodic variations observed in
               the upper atmosphere, and radio propagation effects.  Technical  projects
              include the digital design of signal processing systems, tests  of advanced
              recording heads, and development of realtime control  software.  The students
              will work closely with a staff mentor  throughout the summer, and will prepare
              a report and presentation on  their projects.  The presentations will be given
              at national  conferences, and opportunities will be provided to continue some
              of the  projects during the academic year.  The students will be exposed to all
               aspects of the research facility through seminars and demonstrations at  the
              various unique facilities, and will obtain a thorough practical  experience of
              scientific research at a facility dedicated to research.
