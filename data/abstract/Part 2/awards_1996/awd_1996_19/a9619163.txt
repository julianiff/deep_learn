Abstract    :
              9619163  Rudolph   To increase representation of females in science,
              engineering, and mathematics professions, Project Advance has been designed to
              improve classroom practices with respect to engaging and developing the
              interests of female students, primarily in science and mathematics classrooms,
              and to provide encouragement and role models for young women interested in
              these areas.  The project has three major components:  (1) K-12 teacher/
              administrator training to address gender equity in the science and mathematics
              classroom; (2) elementary teacher training to improve the overall quality of
              science and mathematics instruction; and (3) a mentoring program for female
              secondary students.   The training targets administrators, secondary
              mathematics and science teachers, and all elementary teachers at the 44
              campuses of the Central and Southwest management districts of the Houston
              Independent School District.  Mentoring will target female students interested
              in science/mathematics and will create a network of secondary and university
              students and female professionals from universities and other local
              institutions.  The anticipated outcomes include higher quality instruction in
              science and mathematics in an atmosphere that provides female students with
              opportunities to succeed from kindergarten to high school graduation and an
              institutionalized support network for female secondary students interested in
              science and/or mathematics.
