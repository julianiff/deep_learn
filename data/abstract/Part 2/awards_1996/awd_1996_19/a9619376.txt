Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of
              the Chemistry Division, Butler will continue studies of electronically  
              nonadiabatic chemical reaction pathways.  One set of experiments will   seek to
              predict adiabatic and nonadiabatic reaction channels upon local   electronic
              excitation of a molecular functional group.  As an example,   photofragment
              velocity and angular distribution measurements from   crossed-laser molecular
              beam photodissociation of nitric acid together   with ab initio calculations
              will identify all the product channels of   nitric acid resulting from laser
              excitation.  Other molecules to be   examined include nitromethane, methyl
              nitrate, and nitramide.  In another   set of experiments photofragment velocity
              and angular distribution   analysis of the photodissociation channels of a
              series of amides will use   emission spectroscopy of dissociating molecules to
              characterize the shape   of the potential energy surface in the Franck-Condon
              region.  Detailed   insight into well-known photo-induced bond cleavage
              channels will be   obtained.    The experimental measurements in this project
              combined with calculations   will help us understand the photochemical
              reactivity of complex   molecules.  For example, some reactions are forbidden
              even though there   is enough energy available for them to proceed.  This
              project will   provide a basis by which we can explain some of these unexpected
              outcomes
