Abstract    :
                      9619810  Ongley    The Zimapan Mining District in Hidalgo, Mexico has
              been the site of active mining and smelting activity since the early 1600's. 
              This project has three goals.  First, to locate and evaluate a reasonable
              drinking water aquifer for the town of Zimapan.  Second, to determine the
              arsenic source.  Finally, to involve undergraduate students in a research
              project of genuine scientific interest with an immediate possibility of
              beneficial impact on the residents.
