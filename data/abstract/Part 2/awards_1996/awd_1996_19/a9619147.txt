Abstract    :
              This pilot project will begin to study the impact of a community-based
              electronic network linking members of a rural Minnesota county.  It will follow
              the development of an ambitious electronic network project (Grant Rapids
              Network/Itasca Regional Network, or GrandNet/IRNET) that seeks to link
              businesses, schools, government agencies and households in Itasca County,
              Minnesota.  The project will focus on three fundamental values an electronic
              community can potentially affect:  access to resources, equality of
              opportunity, and civic participation.  To answer questions concerning whether
              groups are relatively advantaged or disadvantaged by this new development, and
              how it affects citizen involvement, a multi-method approach will be tested: 
              The team will collect baseline information and compare it to similar indicators
              as the network is implemented.  Team members will also administer small-scale
              surveys and undertake in-depth interviews and focus group sessions with
              relevant individuals and group representatives - including students, teachers,
              members of special sub-populations, civic leaders and network users -during the
              research period.  The combination of multiple methods will help to assure that
              the results obtained are robust and useful to future communities considering
              the implementation of an electronic network.  To share findings with interested
              researchers and policy-makers, the researchers will prepare conference
              presentations and journal-article manuscripts describing what they have learned
              about the implementation and early effects of the network.
