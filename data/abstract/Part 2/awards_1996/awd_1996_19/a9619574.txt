Abstract    :
              AST-9619574    Analytical Explanations of Chaos and Order in Planetary Motions. 
                An understanding of the origin and evolution mf planetary systems  and their
              constituent bodies has to incorporate a clarification  of the nature of chaos
              and order in planetary motions.  Drs.  Varadi and Kaula, at the University of
              California at Los Angeles,  will investigate and clarify the causes of these
              seemingly  distinct types of behaviors.  The work seeks analytical 
              explanations for the chaotic nature of the motion of the Jovian  planets.  A
              more complete understanding of the role of chaos may  lead to a better
              understanding of the formation and clearing of  the resonance gaps in the
              asteroid belt, the range of possible  stable orbits in and around the giant
              planet zones, and the long-  term stability of planets in the terrestrial zone.
