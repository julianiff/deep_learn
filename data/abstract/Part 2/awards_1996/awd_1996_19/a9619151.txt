Abstract    :
              9619151  Ustach  This award to Duke University will provide a new CTD
              (conductivity, temperature, depth) instrument, a new subbottom profiling
              echosounder, and a disk drive for use on the research vessel Cape Hatteras,
              operated as part of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System
              research fleet. The shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist ocean
              researchers conduct studies in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1997 and in future
              years, and will be especially useful for studies of coastal oceanography along
              the East Coast of the United States.  ***
