Abstract    :
               9619369 Pachavis  A symposium will be held March 31 - April 4, 1997 on Organic
              Electronic Materials and Devices covering the synthesis, processing, and
              characterization of pi-conjugated organic and polymeric materials including
              network structures, self-assembled materials, and nanostructures. The symposium
              is being held to focus on recent progress in a research area rapidly evolving
              toward achievement of better understanding and practical device realization. 
              Organic electronic and photonic materials have significant projected
              advantages, for example, in reduced cost and large area display capability, 
              for a variety of communication and display device applications.  NSF funds will
              be used to support participation by graduate students and young faculty.  There
              will be an opportunity to assess the field, and to establish ties between
              universities, research institutions, and industry.  It is expected that top
              scientists in the field will attend, and that the symposium will provide an
              effective forum to discuss and delineate critical scientific issues in this
              rapidly developing research area. %%%  An evaluation of the progress and status
              of Organic Electronic Materials and Devices and related materials processing
              and characterization issues, especially critical materials research areas of
              synthesis, processing, and the relationship of materials research to device
              fabrication along with current assessments of the most important developments
              in this field will be of great value to the understanding and enhanced
              utilization of organic and polymeric materials in the field of electronics and
              photonics.    ***
