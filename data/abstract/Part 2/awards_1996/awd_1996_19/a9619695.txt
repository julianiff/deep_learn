Abstract    :
              The project examines the impact of new technologies of  information,
              communication, and computerization on the home life  and home-based work life
              of American families. It is a follow-up  study to a 1984-1986 study performed
              by the same researchers, and  an investigation of new areas that have resulted
              from the recent  emergence of new technologies. The project is unique because
              of  the longitudinal opportunity to compare current circumstance with  past
              situations.  The project will (1) develop and test a  theoretical model that
              gives the best understanding of household  adoption and use of new computing
              technologies and their  diffusion into various aspects of home life; (2) assess
              the  extent to which these new technologies have become available to  American
              homes, the nature of their use, and the types of  adopters and users; (3) study
              the impact of these technologies on  family life; (4) uncover what have been
              the significant changes  in uses and impacts that have occurred in the last 10
              years; and  (5) uncover what are the perceptions of and possibilities for 
              social changes wrought by new computing technologies in the home.  The study
              will be based on a national sample of 600 households  with computers and 400
              households without.
