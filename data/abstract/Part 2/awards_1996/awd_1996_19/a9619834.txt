Abstract    :
              9619834  Kouvetakis    The Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Chemical,
              Bio, and  Materials Engineering, Physics and Astronomy, and the Center for 
              Solid State Science at Arizona State University (ASU) will  establish a
              Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at  ASU. The goal of the REU
              program is to introduce basic materials  synthesis and processing to
              prospective middle and high school  teachers, that is, pre-service teachers.
              The REU site is designed  to attract undergraduate students that are engaged in
              education  and teacher training at ASU and at institutions where the 
              opportunities to participate in research programs are limited.  Student
              participants from universities, community colleges, and  tribal colleges in
              Arizona will be involved in research which  includes bioactive surface coating
              for medical implants,  semiconductor corrosion from process residuals, and
              binary and  ternary semiconductor alloys. The student participants will 
              develop teaching modules for the pre-college classroom under the  joint
              guidance of the science and education faculties at ASU.  %%%  This project
              targets an important sector of the undergraduate  student population: future
              middle and high school teachers, and  has the potential for a broad-reaching
              impact on the science  education of future generations.  ***
