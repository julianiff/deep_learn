Abstract    :
              Statistical data are often measured with errors.  Many of the theoretical
              constructions of economic, psychological, and sociological models also depend
              on conceptual variables that are unobservable (e.g., permanent income, rational
              expectation).  To obtain meaningful statistical inference for models containing
              unobservable variables requires either the expansion of existing data bases
              with more precise measurements of variables of interest, or the development of
              analytical frameworks to extract relevant information from currently available
              data sources.  Through the support of previous NSF grants, it has been
              demonstrated that a structural approach, while often imposing hypothetical
              assumptions, can yield useful information if properly conducted, and hence not
              only provides a means to take advantage of information that otherwise might be
              misused or totally ignored, but is also more economical.  This award further
              investigates the identification, estimation, and statistical inference of (i)
              nonstationary time series or nonlinear models when variables are subject to
              random measurement errors; (ii) systematic measurement errors in sample
              surveys; (iii) the implicit market of attributes which forms the basis of new
              measurement of inflation rate and other complicated market analysis and; (iv)
              unobserved heterogeneity in panel data analysis.  Classical parametric and
              nonparametric methods and Bayesian inference via Monte Carlo (Gibbs Sampling)
              methods will be explored.  It is hoped that a successful completion of the
              project will provide additional repertoire of tools to enhance the reliability
              and validity of the research usefulness of federal or private statistical data.
