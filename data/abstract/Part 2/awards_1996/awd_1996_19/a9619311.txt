Abstract    :
              9619311  Walden  This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods
              Hole, Massachusetts, will provide new instrumentation to be used on three
              research vessels, R/V Atlantis, R/V Knorr and R/V Oceanus, operated by WHOI as
              part of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), and
              available to support ocean sciences research projects to investigators from
              throughout the U.S.  Instrumentation includes devices for chemical, biological,
              geological and physical oceanographic research.  The shared-use instrumentation
              supported here will assist researchers to conduct studies throughout the world
              ocean in 1997 and in future years.  ***
