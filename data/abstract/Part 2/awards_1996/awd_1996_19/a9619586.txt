Abstract    :
                        9619586  Cotter    The goal of the 1997 U.M.M. REU project is to
              nurture the development of underrepresented individuals in the geological
              sciences.  Ten undergraduate women will be actively involved in field and
              laboratory research to determine the origin and history of glacial and
              postglacial deposits in west-central Minnesota.  These studies will employ
              varying geologic research techniques including, sediment analysis
              (characterization of till and sediment facies), provenance studies (basic field
              descriptions and identifications, sedimentary petrography, till magnetic
              properties, and till geochemistry) and paleoecology assessments
              (micropaleontology, palynology, sedimentology and clay chemistry.)  This
              research can be readily accomplished by the undergraduate at relatively little
              expense, yet will contribute substantially to the understanding of the glacial
              geology of the area.
