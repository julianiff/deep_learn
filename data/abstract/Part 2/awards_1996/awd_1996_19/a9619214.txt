Abstract    :
              9619214  Froning   This is a proposal to establish islands of support for girls
              in science within schools and girls' organizations.  The Russell Mathematics
              and Science Center (RMSC) proposes to establish partnerships with local school
              systems and girls' organizations to support efforts to help girls succeed in
              science and mathematics.  RMSC is a coeducational specialty area of a
              state-wide public school with its curriculum and teaching methods developed to
              support groups underrepresented in science and mathematics.  It proposes to
              leverage its success at attracting young women to specialize in science at an
              early age by building a program of encouragement for other young women who like
              science and enjoy studying it.  In addition, the project will address two major
              problems:  (a) the lack of science training of adult leaders of girl's
              organizations, and of middle and upper elementary school teachers to provide
              age and gender appropriate science experiences; and (b) the lack of an
              appropriate way of determining the confidence and motivation of girls towards
              the study of science.     The project will:    o provide the Birmingham
              community with organized science activities designed to encourage young women
              and girls to take science-related courses and to look for career opportunities
              in scientific professions;    o conduct commuter summer science camps for girls
              from the Birmingham area;    o train adult/student leaders in teams within
              schools and organizations to support girls interested in science;    o develop
              publishable materials and activities that target women's issues in science and
              that fit into the curriculum of mathematics and science courses in the middle
              and lower high schools;    o develop a survey instrument that measures the
              interest and motivation of girls for continuing their study of science in high
              school and pinpoint their needs/frustrations in their current science classes.
