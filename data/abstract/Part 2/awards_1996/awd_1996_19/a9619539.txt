Abstract    :
              AST-9619539    Further development and Experimental Verification of 
              Electromagnetic Multisphere-Scattering Theory.    Interplanetary and
              interstellar dust particles are often believed  to have a fluffy aggregate
              structure.  Accurate information on  the interaction of electromagnetic
              radiation with these complex  particles is of great importance to many areas of
              astrophysics,  particularly planetary, interstellar, and galactic astronomy. 
              The aim of Dr. Xu's work is to produce a complete rigorous  solution to
              multiparticle scattering problems and to make  available a practical version of
              the theory to the community.  Dr. Xu plans to test the theory in the laboratory
              using microwave  scattering measurements.
