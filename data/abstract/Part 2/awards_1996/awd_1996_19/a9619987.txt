Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for a two-day workshop on record linkage in
              Washington, D.C. on 20-21 March 1997.  The workshop is sponsored by the
              Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics of the National Academy of
              Sciences, the Washington Statistical Society, the Bureau of the Census, the
              National Agricultural Statistical Service, and the National Center for Health
              Statistics.  The whole concept of data sharing is broad-based and pervasive;
              consequently, many different governmental agencies as well as the private
              sector will benefit from this workshop.  Since the only previous major U.S.
              record linkage workshop (in 1985), much has been accomplished, especially in
              recent years, and new areas of related research have arisen.  A sampling of
              these which the conference will spotlight includes the increased privacy
              concerns due to record linkage, the growing importance of more efficient use of
              statistical resources by using record linkage, heightened interest in linkage
              technology due to debates such as health care reform, issues in physical
              security of data, and the measurement of nondisclosure and reidentification
              risks in public use microdata files.  Proceedings of the conference will
              capture the invited presentations as well as summarize discussions and suggest
              research challenges for the next decade.
