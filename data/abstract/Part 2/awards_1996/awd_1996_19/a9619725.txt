Abstract    :
              9619725  Schaffner    This proposal requests funding to continue a summer REU
              site  in the various disciplines of coastal marine sciences at the  College of
              William and Mary.  Nine minority undergraduates  are to be recruited each year
              from science departments  nationally to conduct research at William and Mary. 
              Each  student is paired with a research scientist or faculty  advisor, chosen
              to reflect the student's interests and  background.  The program consists of a
              variety of scientific  lectures, discussion groups, and a cruise with the
              intention  of providing students a broad research experience.  ***
