Abstract    :
              9619682  Benziger    The Princeton Materials Institute (PMI) at Princeton
              University  will establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)  site
              to bring sophomore and junior students from other colleges  and universities to
              Princeton for a ten-week summer research  program. The students will
              participate in a variety of existing  materials science research programs under
              the direction of  faculty from science and engineering departments that are 
              associated with the Princeton Materials Institute. Special  recruiting efforts
              are being made to attract students from  minority institutions and colleges
              where research experiences are  limited. The research experience will be
              complemented with short  courses in areas of materials science, an engineering
              ethics  seminar, and laboratory visits to local companies involved in 
              materials engineering.  %%%  Princeton University has a history of providing
              strong support  for undergraduate research. The expansion of the existing 
              undergraduate research activity to include undergraduate students  from other
              institutions will be mutually beneficial to the  Princeton and to the outside
              students and faculty.  ***
