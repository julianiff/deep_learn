Abstract    :
              9619957  Cremer, James   University of Iowa    Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates at the University of Iowa in Experimental Computer Science   
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports 12
              students per year in programs carried out during the summers, for three years. 
              The students participate in a variety of computer science research projects,
              with emphasis on experimental and applied research.  Students are recruited
              nationally and matched with active faculty members in research areas including:
              virtual environments, real-time simulation, graphics, computer vision,
              computational geometry, distributed systems, and artificial intelligence. 
              Substantial effort is placed on recruiting minority students and students from
              non-research institutions.  The program provides a coherent experience
              involving close interaction between faculty, graduate students, and REU
              students, hands-on experience with state-of-the-art software and computing
              facilities, and work on challenging and important research problems.
