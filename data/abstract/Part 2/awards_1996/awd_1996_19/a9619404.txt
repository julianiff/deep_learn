Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              Site in  Psychology at Skidmore College.  The eight week program will permit
              ten students to participate in many phases of research, such as designing
              studies, testing, analyzing data, and writing results.  The projects providing
              the focus for the research experience will include the study of children's
              memory confusions, factors influencing face recognition, memory for nonverbal
              aspects of communication, effects on memory of information overload,
              physiological effects of stress, and mortality salience.  The research interns
              will also participate in several workshops designed to enhance their ability to
              pursue more independent research experiences, such as the use of statistical
              packages and software packages for experimental control, and workshops focused
              on graduate school.  This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing
              efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active
              undergraduate research experiences.
