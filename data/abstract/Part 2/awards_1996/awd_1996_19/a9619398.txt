Abstract    :
              Barnes/Abstract         The objective of this research is the evolution of
              cumulus  convection as observed by research aircraft in two previous field 
              experiments (CaPE, 1991;  CCOPE, 1981).  Particular emphasis will  be devoted
              to vertical momentum transport during the cloud's life  cycle and how the
              cloud, in turn, modifies its near environment  abouve the boundary layer.  The
              results should benefit those  attepting to develop theories of cumulus
              convection.
