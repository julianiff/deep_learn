Abstract    :
              Abstract - Karen Magee-Sauer  The prime objective of the research to be carried
              out  is to  make measurements of the ammonia (NH3) abundance in several  comets
              and to measure the spatial profile and other  characteristics of the emission.
              Models of solar nebula  chemistry predict that the dominant nitrogen gas in the
               solar nebula was Nitrogen (N2) while the dominant nitrogen  gas in the
              sub-nebulae of the giant planets was ammonia  (NH3) (Fegley and Prinn, 1989).
              The ratios N2/NH3 and  NH3/H20 enable on e to test solar nebula models and are 
              important diagnostics of the origins of cometary ices  (Lunine 1989, Fegley and
              Prinn 1989, Womack et al. 1992).  Ammonia (NH3) had long been believed to be a
              significant  reservoir for volatile nitrogen in comets, but until  recently its
              presence had not been directly observed.  The  advancement of infrared detector
              technology has made it  possible to directly detect NH3 in comets via its
              rotational  vibrational transitions in the 3.0 micron wavelength region.  The
              observations will consist of detecting the rotational-  vibrational transition
              in the 3 micron wavelength region of  the nu-1 vibrational band of NH3.  The
              g-factors  (fluorescence efficiency factors) of the Q, R-, and P-  branches
              within this band are not available.  In order to  relate the observed intensity
              of its spectral lines to a  production rate of ammonia, these g-factors need to
              be  known.  Therefore, as part of my analysis for the relative  abundance of
              NH3, I will calculate the relevant nu-1 g-  factors using known laboratory band
              intensities and non-LTE  rotational distributions appropriate for cometary 
              conditions.  The focus of this project is on observing the NH3 in comets,  and
              the results of this research will provide important  information on the NH3
              abundance and nature of the emission.  The results will be used to help answer
              the basic question  of the origin of comets, study whether NH3 is a parent 
              molecule present as a natal ice in comets, and by examining  the spatial ch
              aracteristics associated with the emission,  and determine whether some ammonia
              is produced from an  extended source.  Undergraduate students at Rowan College
              of New Jersey will  assist in developing data reduction techniques and in 
              analyzing the data.
