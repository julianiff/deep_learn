Abstract    :
              Lian  9619884    This research is concerned with work on mirror symmetry and
              modular functions.  The principal investigator will work on extending known
              results for toric hypersurfaces to the case of toric complete intersections. 
              He will try to construct all large radius limit points. He will also work on
              extending work on modularity of the mirror map for K3 surfaces to arbitrary
              1-parameter families and to multiparameter families. Finally, he will study
              S-duality for K3-fibered threefolds.    This is research in the field of
              algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern
              mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
              quarter-century.  In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in
              the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and
              conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in physics,
              theoretical computer science, and robotics.
