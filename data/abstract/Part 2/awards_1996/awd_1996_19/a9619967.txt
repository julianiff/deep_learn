Abstract    :
              The synthesis of images directly into a procedural format  will be investigated.
               The realistic imaging techniques to  be developed will determine the
              parameters and coefficients  necessary for a procedural description instead of
              finding  the individual pixels that compose a spatial representation.  This
              approach will permit the new algorithms to take  advantage of information that
              is not available when only the  spatial form has been computed.  This should
              make it  possible to exploit such things as the statistical  properties of
              images and the effect of visual masking.  By  moving the output of an image
              synthesis technique closer to  what is produced by an image compression
              algorithm, the  computation of unnecessary information will be avoided and  the
              final result will be more consistent with current  practices for storing or
              transmitting computer graphic  images.  Finally, the use of perceptually based
              procedural  representations will facilitate the use of visual metrics to 
              control how a picture is computed and to decide whether it  is of adequate
              quality.  ***
