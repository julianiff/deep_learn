Abstract    :
              9619821  Warder    ABSTRACT      The purpose of this project is to provide
              research experiences in bioengineering for 12 undergraduate students at The
              University of Memphis (UM).  At least half of the students will be selected
              from institutions other than UM, with several recruited from HCBU institutions
              such as Tennessee State, Rust College (Mississippi), and Clafin College (South
              Carolina), and other undergraduate schools in the State.  Each student will
              undertake a specific research project, and a faculty advisor (participating in
              the REU program) will work with the student to develop his/her research skills.
               An essential element of the program will be its emphasis on professional
              development of the students (e.g., paper writing and technical presentations). 
              The purpose is to infuse bright undergraduate students with an enthusiasm
              towards graduate level education and research careers.   The University of
              Memphis has made substantial institutional commitments to the program.  These
              include waiver of tuition and fees for the student participants, waiver of all
              overhead costs, and stipends for two minority students (in addition to those
              supported by the NSF funds).  ***
