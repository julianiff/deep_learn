Abstract    :
              This project combines a novel approach to geometric modeling  with modern
              software engineering techniques.  It paints the  picture of a geometric
              computing environment that unifies surface-  and volume-based models to a
              compact internal representation of  geometry.  The Spartan internal structure
              covers a broad range of  applications and needs through the multiple
              appearances paradigm,  which includes shapes and skeleta, triangle and
              tetrahedron  meshes, smooth surfaces, and multi-scale representations.    The
              approach is backed by an extensive mathematical theory of  shape and space.  It
              provides local and global control and  supports geometric deformations in
              unprecedented quality and  generality.  The complementary mathematical and
              algorithmic  theories have recently matured to a point that warrants an 
              intense effort in developing a software prototype of the  envisioned system. 
              The goal is to make the new technology  available to a broad user-base of
              geometric modeling and design  tools.
