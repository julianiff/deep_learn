Abstract    :
                  This proposal requests funding to continue a summer  REU  site in the
              various disciplines of ocean and earth sciences  at the Lamont-Doherty Earth
              Observatory of Columbia  University.  Approximately 10 undergraduates are to be
               recruited nationally to conduct research at LDEO.  Each  student is paired
              with a senior researcher, chosen to  reflect the student's interests and
              background.  The program  consists of a variety of scientific lectures and
              discussion  groups, a written report, a final oral presentation, and a  program
              of social and scientific interactions.
