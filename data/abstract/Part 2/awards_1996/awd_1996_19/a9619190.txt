Abstract    :
                This project, having long-term technological relevance, is  supported in the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, and  focusses on the study of
              heterogeneous reaction dynamics.   Professor Andrew B. Bocarsly and his
              students at Princeton  University will use molecular beams, surface
              spectroscopic and  microscopic methods, and flow reactor studies to
              characterize the  reactions so that models for these processes can be
              developed.   Catalytic decomposition and oxidation reactions will be studied in
               detail.  Many technologically important processes occur between gas and 
              liquid phase reactants and solid surfaces.  These heterogeneous  reactions can
              increase the efficiency of important industrial  processes and be used to limit
              amounts of undesirable constituents  present in effluents from many common
              processes.  Professor  Bocarsly and his students at Princeton University will
              study  reactions involving carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides as well as 
              processes for preparing solid surfaces that have desired catalytic  properties.
