Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              Site in Experimental Psychology at the University of South Carolina, Columbia. 
              The eight week program will permit ten well qualified students majoring in a
              behavioral science to experience graduate level research.  A major goal of the
              recruitment effort will be to involve undergraduates from underrepresented
              groups in basic psychological research, especially minority students and
              students from small institutions without major psychological laboratory
              facilities.  Students will participate in experimental research including
              literature review, hypothesis generation, data collection, data organization,
              statistical analysis, and writing of papers.  Student experiences will be
              enriched by weekly research seminars where assigned readings will be discussed,
              and by weekly sessions on problems of research design and statistics in
              experimental psychology.  This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing
              efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active
              undergraduate research experiences.
