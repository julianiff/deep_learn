Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funding to initiate a fall term REU  site in the various
              disciplines of coastal marine sciences  at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab, Alabama.
               Seven  undergraduates with career interests in coastal marine  sciences are to
              be recruited each year to conduct research  at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab. 
              Each student is paired with  a research scientist or faculty advisor, chosen to
              reflect  the student's interests and background.  The program  cmnsists of  a
              variety of scientific lectures, discussion  groups, and a cruise with the
              intention of providing  students a broad research experience.
