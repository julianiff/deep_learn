Abstract    :
              AST-9619516    Global Statistical Models of the Galaxy.    Drs. Kochanek and Di
              Stefano, at Harvard University, will  integrate a wide variety of observational
              data sets in order to  derive a model for the structure of the Galaxy.  They
              will use a  combination of distance estimators, dynamical data, and 
              microlensing data in a well-defined statistical analysis.  The  elements of the
              Galactic model to be determined include the  distance scale to the Galactic
              Center, the rotation curve, the  disk mass and shape, the properties of the
              bar, the halo  structure, and orbital characteristics of Galactic satellites. 
              The advantage of global models, as compared to modeling isolated  pieces of
              data on the Galaxy, is that the constraint that all  data must agree on a
              common mass distribution is an  extraordinarily powerful constraint.  Such
              models and realistic  estimates of their uncertainties are the key to
              estimating the  dark matter distribution of the Galaxy, limiting or determining
               the amount of non-axisymmetry, interpreting the results of  gravitational
              microlensing surveys, and understanding the  distribution of Galactic
              components.  ===============================
