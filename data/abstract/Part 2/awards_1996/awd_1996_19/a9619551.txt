Abstract    :
                        9619551  Bertka    The goal is to create a ten week summer program
              whose main objective is to provide undergraduate students with a participatory
              introduction to a research environment.  By inviting students to join staff in
              their research efforts over a concentrated time period, students will have a
              learning experience that is normally unavailable at their colleges during the
              regular academic year.  A summer program also offers the advantage of exposing
              the greatest number of students over the grant period to the challenges and
              rewards of a career in scientific research.  With a successful summer program,
              the Geophysical Laboratory can contribute to science education through the
              realm of science it knows best, fundamental research, and expand its present
              impact on the education of graduate students and postdocs to undergraduates as
              well.
