Abstract    :
              9619234  Whitledge  This award to University of Texas at Austin will provide new
              salinometer and fluorometer instrumentation for use on the R/V Longhorn, a
              102-foot research vessel operated as part of the University National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS).  The shared-use instrumentation
              supported here will assist researchers to conduct studies of the physical
              oceanography and marine biology in the Gulf of Mexico in 1997 and in future
              years.  ***
