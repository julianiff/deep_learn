Abstract    :
              9619674  Kummer    ABSTRACT    This proposal to continue a summer biomedical
              engineering research fellowship program for undergraduates is based on program
              successfully conducted at this institution for fifteen consecutive summers, the
              past four of which were conducted with NSF-REU support.  The program is based
              on the premise that the ideal place to supplement the basic education of
              bioengineers with practical experience and expose them to real-life situations
              of the sort that will characterize their future careers in the intense medical
              environment of a teaching hospital.  Such experience is critical to the
              education of engineers and scientists who will create new concepts and develop,
              design, and manufacture medical devices.  Such training, moreover, is necessary
              to maintain and expand the competitive edge enjoyed by the U.S. medical device
              industry, whose products are recognized as being the world's best.  The
              program's projects, chosen from ongoing research activities at the Hospital for
              Joint Diseases' Musculoskeletal Research Center with independent fund sources,
              involve ligament and cartilage repair, spinal fixation, fracture repair,
              physical chemistry of biomineralization, mechanical effects on tissue growth,
              and total joint design.  In previous years, this strategy of adding
              undergraduate fellows to established research groups has maximized the
              students' results and given them a sense of contributing to an ongoing, useful
              research effort.  ***
