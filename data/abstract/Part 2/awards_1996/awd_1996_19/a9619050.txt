Abstract    :
              9619050  Selfe    This three year project is an outgrowth of an existing project
              with the University of Washington.  It proposes to provide 25 teachers each who
              either are Native Americans or teach largely Native American children on or
              near the reservations.  The project will provide four week enhancement
              activities in chemistry and other disciplines within the context of current
              environmental issues of importance to the  tribal communities.  The primary
              area of interest and the basis of the enhancement activities are environmental
              issues.  The PI has clearly addressed concerns with the learning styles of
              Native American children.  All activities with teachers will model effective
              pedagogy. The teachers will work directly with secondary school students to
              determine how well their methods work in a classroom environment.  These
              students are/will be a part of a companion program not funded by this project. 
              The project director is a Native American and a teacher.  Extensive follow-up
              during the academic year as well as electronic communication using computer
              systems donated by other groups.    A cost share of gifts-in-kind will bring
              the total up to approximately 28% of the award amount.
