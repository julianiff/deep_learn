Abstract    :
              9619992  Rao    ABSTRACT      The objective of this project is to develop an
              interdisciplinary research program in mechatronics and smart structures for the
              benefit of undergraduate students.  The University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) has
              been quite successful in attracting grants and establishing a state-of-the-art
              research facility in these areas.  The researchers at UMR are currently
              developing a collaborative relationship with the University of Turabo, Puerto
              Rico (a minority, undergraduate university) to conduct joint research in the
              field of mechatronics and smart structures.  The overall goals of the project
              being proposed are (i) introduction of mechatronics and smart structures
              concepts to junior/senior undergraduate students, (ii) development of an
              interdisciplinary educational experience for students working in teams
              involving students from different disciplines, (iii) providing a unique
              opportunity to minority students from the University of Turabo and other
              schools to conduct research in state-of-the-art laboratories, and (iv)
              involving undergraduate students with ongoing research programs in areas and
              technologies of national importance.  To accomplish these objectives, our
              approach will be to (i) develop a eight-week summer course on mechatronics and
              smart structures, (ii) develop team design projects, (iii) involve graduate
              students as mentors, and (iv) provide hands-on experience in the computer-aided
              design and control of mechanical systems.  The novel feature of this project is
              the involvement of minority undergraduate students in the development of a
              multidisciplinary research experience.  ***
