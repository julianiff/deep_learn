Abstract    :
              9619999  Rabalais  This award to Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium will
              provide a liquid scintillation counter for use on the research vessel Pelican,
              operated as part of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System
              fleet.  The scintillation counter will provide rapid analyses which can be used
              to assist in real-time decisions about sampling programs, and will further
              assist in monitoring the ship for contamination.  This shared-use instrument
              will assist ocean scientists conduct studies of the Gulf of Mexico in 1997 and
              in future years.  ***
