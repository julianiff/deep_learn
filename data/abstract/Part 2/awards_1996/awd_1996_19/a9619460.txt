Abstract    :
              Smecker-Hane, Tammy  96-19460    Dr. Smecker-Hane and collaborators will
              determine  the star-formation and chemical-evolution  histories of dwarf
              galaxies in the Local Group.  They will combine photometry of stars from the
              tip  of the giant branch to well below the main-  sequence turnoff with
              spectroscopic metallicity  determinations for a few hundred stars in each of 
              three galaxies.  A fourth galaxy will be observed  with the Keck 10-m telescope
              to determine  compositions for stars outside of the inner  regions of our own
              Galaxy.  The abundance patterns  will lead to estimates of how the
              star-formation  rate and gas content evolved.  These studies will  be combined
              with new theoretical models and  numerical simulations of dwarf galaxies. 
              Comparing the models with the data obtained will  lead to fundamental advances
              in understanding the  physical mechanisms that control the evolution of 
              galaxies.
