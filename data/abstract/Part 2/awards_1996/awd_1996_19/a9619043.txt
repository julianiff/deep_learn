Abstract    :
              9619043  Frascella    The Indiana Mathematics Initiative (IMI) is a five-year
              teacher enhancement and curricular implementation effort involving a
              partnership among Indiana University, the Middle Grades Network, and twelve
              urban school districts in Indiana.  The project provides extensive professional
              development experiences of 132 - 180 hours for each of 445 mathematics teachers
              and administrators in 62 middle and secondary schools that are fully committed
              to mathematics education reform at all grade levels.  The experiences are
              designed to enable each teacher to use effectively one of four sets of
              NSF-supported middle school instructional materials (Connected Mathematics,
              Mathematics in Context, Seeing and Thinking Mathematically, or Six through
              Eight Mathematics) or one of four sets of NSF-supported secondary school
              materials (Core Plus, ARISE, Interactive Mathematics Program, or SIMMS).     
              Submitted under the guidelines for Local Systemic Change through Teacher
              Enhancement in Mathematics, Grades 7-12, the project seeks to create
              significant changes in how the teachers perceive mathematics and how it is
              learned, as well as in their views of their roles in middle/secondary
              mathematics classrooms.  These changes will be effected in a variety of ways: 
              (1) intensive and extensive meetings, seminars, and workshops involving the
              teachers, IMI staff, and representatives of the curriculum projects; (2)
              continuous support and technical assistance by IMI staff following seminars and
              workshops; (3) leadership development of lead teachers, district curriculum
              coordinators, and other school administrators to insure sustained, systemic
              change; and (4) coordination with current state reform efforts, especially
              Indiana's upcoming mathematics textbook adoption process.       Non-federal
              cost-sharing in the project is over $ 2,000,000, of which more than   $
              1,740,000 is to be derived from the twelve participating school districts,
              approximately   $ 227,000 from Indiana University, and approximately $ 35,00 0
              from the Middle Grades Network.
