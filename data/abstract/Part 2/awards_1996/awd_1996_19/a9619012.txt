Abstract    :
                      9619012  Fisher    This three year project seeks to improve mathematics,
              science and technology education by integrating the use of systems thinking and
              dynamic computer modeling into the high school curriculum. Building on an
              earlier project, this effort expands the project's role in serving Oregon and
              adds national centers to serve other regions.  Forty teachers are trained each
              year, 31 from Oregon and 9 from national sites.  The focus of the twelve-day
              summer session and three-day follow-up are on systems thinking, dynamic
              computer modeling using STELLA software and other tools, and instructional
              approaches applying these concepts and skills in ways that are appropriate for
              diverse students populations.    Other features include an extensive plan for
              on-going support and the expansion and formalization of an accessible cross-and
              single-disciplinary library of models.  A WWW site and the Creative Learning
              Exchange are used as additional dissemination tools.    Cost sharing is 38%
