Abstract    :
              ECS-9619220  La Berge    The present trend toward a global economy, especially
              in the energy sector, as well as the formation of powerful transnational
              economical and political entities such as the EEC, are having important impact
              on engineering education.  These developments when combined with changing
              requirements of industry for the capabilities of engineers and different
              patterns of engineering research, have prompted faculty members at Virginia
              Tech to propose a four and one half day workshop entitled "International
              Workshop on Engineering education Reforms with Emphasis on Electric Power
              Systems." The workshop will be held in Grenoble, France, in December, 1997 and
              will bring together faculty members and graduate students from universities in
              the United States, Japan, Korea, Singapore and the Middle East, with
              representatives of industries, EPRI, ABET, and FEANI to discuss these
              developments.  Invited presentations have been solicited and proceedings will
              be issued.  In addition to support from NSF, support from European universities
              and regions is anticipated.
