Abstract    :
               This project is the result of 7 years of planning and work by members of the
              science and mathematics departments to produce a change in the science
              education of non-science-majors. Two years ago, the faculty of the College of
              Liberal Arts and Sciences voted to modify the curriculum to increase the core
              science requirement to include a capstone course in science called Science and
              Technology Today. This multidisciplinary integrated science course has been
              designed to use current topics in science, multimedia computers, existing
              international collaborations, Internet, cooperative learning techniques, and
              laboratory exercises to provide a new science experience for students.   The
              new course depends on in-class use, by students working in pairs, of multimedia
              computers and instructor-controlled laser disk textbooks with liquid crystal
              display monitors and overhead projection to student work areas. The pilot
              section of the course has been given with such encouraging results that the
              details have been written and submitted as a paper to the Journal of College
              Science Teaching. Through this project, the department has acquired the
              necessary multimedia equipment, computers, and laser disk players, to support
              the full implementation of this new course, which can be taken by 400 students
              per year.
