Abstract    :
               Imaging is fueling research and revolutionizing industry. This area of
              research, traditionally viewed as highly specialized, is becoming mainstream.
              Laboratories have been developed that teach college freshmen how to create
              filters that manipulate images. The early introduction of imaging technology
              creates an opportunity to address important questions about imaging and allows
              students to participate in interesting computer science learning as freshmen.
              Students learn about programming, using arrays and modifying classes. The use
              of object-oriented techniques has made it possible for students to easily
              enhance the functionality of an imaging system by adding filter member
              functions to preexisting classes. This project provides funding for several
              digital cameras and a color printer. These tools provide students with a more
              comprehensive view of the imaging process.
