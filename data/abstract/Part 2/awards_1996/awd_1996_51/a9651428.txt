Abstract    :
               Courses on computer networks and distributed operating systems rarely provide
              students with realistic hands-on experience. As computer technology moves into
              a new era characterized by multimedia communications and high-performance
              computing, this deficiency becomes more and more significant. It is imperative
              that changes are made at the undergraduate level to keep up with the evolution
              of theoretical and practical skills. A series of courses in computer networks
              and operating systems has been developed to address these changes. The success
              of this innovative curriculum depends to a large extent on this project, which
              funds the establishment of a modern networking and operating systems
              laboratory. This laboratory facilitates experiments with network installation,
              system administration and testing, multimedia (specifically audio/video)
              traffic control, and operating system management.
