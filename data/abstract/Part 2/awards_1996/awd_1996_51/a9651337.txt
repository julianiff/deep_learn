Abstract    :
               This project provides funds to introduce computer-based data acquisition
              systems into the physiology-intensive laboratory curricula designed for life
              and health science premajors. The project incorporates Power Macintosh
              computers connected to MacLab 2- and 4-channel signal interfaces for data
              collection, data analysis, and report writing into the structural design of the
              experimental methods of six laboratories.   Eight student workstations are
              being developed in one of the four teaching laboratories. Each station includes
              a Macintosh computer connected to a MacLab interface unit that accepts and
              conditions signals from compatible physiological sensors and transducers.  
              Computer acquisition of data permits students to make better use of limited and
              valuable laboratory time involved in recording data, conducting appropriate
              statistical analysis of results, and writing interpretations as they develop
              their laboratory skills in preparation for the analytical and diagnostic
              applications they will encounter in their upper-division life science or
              advanced health specialties.
