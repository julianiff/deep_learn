Abstract    :
              The Mathematics Department has been actively involved since 1988 in a serious
              and successful program to improve instruction, understanding, and retention for
              women and minority students in its calculus courses. Mathematics students use
              computer technology in collaborative teams to create portfolios of challenging
              projects.    Science classes, as well as mathematics classes, have been using
              this calculus laboratory to create portfolios of challenging projects.  This
              project provides 40 laptop computers (20 to the Mathematics Department and 20
              to the Science Department)and 100 TI-92 calculators (40 to the Mathematics
              Department, 40 to the Science Department, and 20 to the Mathematics
              Laboratory).  These  laboratory capabilities will create an educational
              environment that emphasizes the interconnection of all fields of scientific
              knowledge in order to prepare students more effectively for the scientific
              environment of the future.
