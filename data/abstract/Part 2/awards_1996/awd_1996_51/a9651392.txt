Abstract    :
               This Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Project is directed at
              upgrading three existing undergraduate laboratory courses in archaeology
              through acquisition of basic geophysical remote-sensing equipment and
              enhancement of undergraduate teaching, student training, and student experience
              with geophysical field and lab technology. Archaeological field and lab methods
              are taught in a cycle of three established courses conducted by the applicant
              at the Department of Anthropology. The courses include Introduction to Field
              and Lab Methods in Archaeology, Field And Lab Experience in Archaeology, and
              Collection and Data Analysis in Archaeology.   The set of three lab courses
              offers students the up-to-date methods and technology essential to archaeology.
              The project is dedicated to the introduction of practical contemporary
              applications of geophysical Remote Sensing as vital nondestructive surveying
              and sampling technology for archaeology.   Previously, geophysical
              remote-sensing technologies have been discussed only in the lab and field
              series in archaeology as an integral part of field survey and sampling. No
              appropriate geophysical equipment has been available for field and lab
              teaching, training, and practical student experimentation and testing, apart
              from GPS instrumentation and manual surveying equipment.
