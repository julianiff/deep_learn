Abstract    :
               Plant sciences is often one of the more neglected areas in biology education.
              Students are usually less familiar with plants than animals and often are not
              as stimulated by plant research, given plants' static nature and slow growth.
              This project is designed to develop laboratory exercises for a plant physiology
              course that can give students some unexpected and interesting insights into
              plant biology. Once the exercises are implemented and refined in the plant
              physiology course, some of them can be used in introductory courses to
              stimulate interest there as well.   The exercises involve video and image
              capture to analyze patterns of growth and physiological behavior. One approach
              makes videotape recordings of rapid plant motions, analyzing them in
              frame-by-frame sequences and quantifying the observations. Similarly, slow
              plant motions can be analyzed by time-lapse techniques that reveal fascinating
              patterns of motion not easily visualized by real-time observation. For both
              techniques, videotape is analyzed with a video micrometer system that allows
              precise measurements to be made for analysis, or video sequences are digitized
              into a computer for more complex image analysis and processing. A variety of
              student group projects can be accommodated during the course of a semester,
              providing the students with an opportunity to plan an experiment, carry it out,
              analyze the results, and make a final presentation to the class.
