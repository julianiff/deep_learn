Abstract    :
               This project establishes an advanced Information Technology Laboratory for
              improving the undergraduate curriculum in computer information systems (CIS).
              The improvements include developing new and upgraded laboratory projects for
              all the courses, in particular, Information Systems Analysis and Design and
              Management Support Systems courses, as well as offering a new course in
              Software Development. The projects are team-oriented and emphasize group
              problem-solving skills with groupware support. LotusNOTES is used to create
              workgroups that facilitate the storing and sharing of project information.   In
              the Information Systems Analysis and Design course, students are required to
              work in groups on real-life business information systems problems. Each project
              group undertakes an in-depth analysis of an information systems problem,
              develops a set of requirement specifications, and designs a system to meet
              those needs. In the Management Support Systems course, students work on a new
              semester-long project to develop a prototype decision support system based on a
              real-life business problem. In each of these courses, the projects require
              substantial computing resources, both hardware and software, not previously
              available to the students.   The new laboratory includes 15 networked student
              workstations, 3 instructor workstations, 1 network server, application
              development software, workgroup software, and other auxiliary equipment.
