Abstract    :
              This project will improve instruction in undergraduate chemical oceanography
              laboratory through use of analytical instruments including a salinometer,
              environmental data logger, fluorometer, flowmeter, optical endpoint unit for
              Winkler oxygen titration, autoanalyzer for analysis of nutrients, and
              spectrophotometer. The equipment will be used by the senior level field
              research courses in oceanography and as part of the research required for honor
              students in marine science. The laboratory equipment is used in the summer by
              undergraduate students doing field research with faculty and by a high school
              teacher training program.
