Abstract    :
               The aim of the project is the development of capillary electrophoresis (CE)
              experiments in Honors General Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, and
              Biochemistry courses. The instrumentation needed includes CE with a
              fluorescence detector and a continuous wavelength detection system, software,
              and a printer. This equipment is as an integral part of the laboratory
              component of these courses. The laboratory experiments enable the student to
              experience firsthand the separation principles that are taught in the course
              lectures. Examples include protein analysis, peptide sequencing, DNA fragment
              analysis, and small molecules in biological and environmental samples. In
              addition, students use this modern instrument to do research during the
              academic year and summer. The significance of the project is that students will
              be trained in a state-of-the-art bioanalytical technique. The addition of a
              capillary electrophoresis instrument enhances the teaching efforts in Honors
              General Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, and Biochemistry.
