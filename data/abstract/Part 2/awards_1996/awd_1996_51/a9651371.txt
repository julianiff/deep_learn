Abstract    :
               The overall objective of this project is to improve undergraduate education in
              the psychology department. Specific objectives of the project are to (1)
              improve the overall teaching of courses in the psychology curriculum, (2)
              improve the teaching of general scientific principles and methods, (3) improve
              the teaching of critical thinking skills, and (4) improve student attitudes
              about science and computer technology. These objectives are being met by
              creating a computer laboratory capable of sustaining a cohesive sequence of
              courses in research and statistical methodology in psychology. The laboratory
              consists of 15 linked computer workstations that contain software specifically
              designed to enhance learning in a required sequence of courses that convey the
              principles and content of the scientific study of psychology.   The purpose of
              this project is to facilitate a shift in the emphasis of undergraduate
              education in psychology from one of passive (lecture-based) learning to that of
              active (experiential) learning, by allowing students to explore
              psychology-related concepts in a hands-on, engaging manner. Furthermore, this
              project enables students to more easily acquire the skills that will enable
              them to conduct their own research projects, which will lead to greater
              enthusiasm toward developing, conducting, analyzing, and reporting
              psychological research.
