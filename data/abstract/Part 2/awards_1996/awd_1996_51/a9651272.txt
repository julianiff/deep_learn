Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop applications of modern positioning
              and mapping technology to environmental investigations. Approximately 120
              undergraduates per year will be impacted, including multidisciplinary majors in
              new environmental sciences programs as well as geology majors. Because many
              students declaring these new majors express interest in ecology or hydrology,
              field laboratory exercises are developed around these themes. Two new
              instrument systems are requested. The Electronic Total Station system will
              allow undergraduates to make maps of an appropriate scale and detail needed for
              many environmental projects and to make non-intrusive measurements that locate
              remote positions. Global Positioning System (GPS) techniques and applications
              will also be taught, first through laboratory exercises in which GPS is the
              focus and later through routine use of GPS in support of other field laboratory
              projects. These laboratory exercises also introduce students to information
              available over the Internet, demonstrate to students the use of computers to
              process and display data, expose the students to field projects that might
              inspire senior thesis ideas, and require students to apply their mathematical
              training as they use geometry and trigonometry to answer questions of an
              ecological nature. Undergraduates will use these instruments as appropriate in
              support of senior research projects required as the capstone for the bachelor's
              degree in environmental sciences. Laboratory manuals developed for use of these
              instruments will be available through the WWW and results of this and of
              students' projects will be reported at regional meetings of professional
              societies.
