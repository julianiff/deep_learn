Abstract    :
               There is a growing consensus that student learning in the sciences is enhanced
              by a research-like laboratory experience. However, the number of students who
              can actually participate in faculty-student research is generally limited by
              both faculty time and resources. An alternative to this is to provide
              research-like experiences during course laboratories by allowing students to
              carry out experiments in which the outcome is unknown.   Courses in
              environmental analysis, which often are interesting to students, are offering
              students an opportunity to participate in these experiments. This project
              incorporates the use of ion chromatography and field analyses into two
              courses_Analytical Chemistry and Environmental Analysis. The Analytical
              Chemistry course is introducing two new experiments involving multiple
              analytical techniques (including ion chromatography). These experiments focus
              on the drinking water treatment process. Environmental Analysis, a new course
              focusing on the interplay of chemical and biological factors in ecosystems,
              provides a strong field and laboratory component. The course is being
              team-taught by an ecologist and an analytical chemist. It involves extensive
              use of an ion chromatograph to study both freshwater and soil processes.
              Multiple field pH and dissolved oxygen meters enable the class to work in small
              groups simultaneously, measuring chemical parameters in the field. Use of these
              instruments results in increased student interest.
