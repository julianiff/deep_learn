Abstract    :
               Physics students from this institution have enjoyed significant success in
              academia and industry because they have graduated with a thorough understanding
              of modern experimental techniques that can be applied to a variety of
              scientific questions. Many of the traditional instruments with which students
              work can now be replaced by a single computer and an inexpensive data
              acquisition card. The resulting `virtual instruments` are created from
              user-selected or designed software for a specific task, offering tremendous
              flexibility in experiment design. This project is developing virtual
              instrumentation stations for the experimental labs in the Physics Department,
              for use by students at all levels. This equipment helps students understand
              that good experimentation is not about obtaining a `correct` result, but rather
              on the process of investigation. In providing virtual instruments that are
              relatively quick to set up, easy to use, and inexpensive to operate for a wide
              range of experimental purposes, the department hopes to encourage students to
              explore more innovative and iterative experiments than they would pursue with
              more traditional equipment.
