Abstract    :
                   At the present time interdisciplinary, field-based, courses for the
              training of environmental scientists are extremely rare; this is particularly
              true for the lower level of undergraduate education. As part of the new
              Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science (BSES) program at Indiana
              University, an interdisciplinary field course for environmental scientists
              (G329) will be created that emphasizes site characterization, hydrogeology, and
              ecosystem analysis in addition to traditional geologic principles. A second
              course will be created through modification of an existing course for advanced
              geologic study (G429); the revised course (G429e) will include environmental
              components and place more emphasis on surficial geology. These new courses will
              utilize the Indiana University Geologic Field Station located in the Tobacco
              Root Mountains, Montana as their base for instruction. The new curriculum will
              consist of a combination of teaching exercises, independent evaluation
              exercises, and a Final Study Area project. Together, G329 and G429e constitute
              a sequence of field-based education open to students from other accredited
              colleges and universities. One unique aspect of the new curricula will be the
              utilization of an instrumented Demonstration Watershed for instructional
              purposes. The Demonstration Watershed will contain state-of-the-art monitoring
              equipment established as part of a cooperative effort involving Indiana
              University, State and Federal agencies, as well as the local water district and
              ranchers. In order to ensure dissemination of curricula materials we have
              proposed an on-site visitation program for external faculty members.
