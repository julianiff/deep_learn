Abstract    :
               This project provides funds to purchase a Nicolet gas
              chromatography/Fourier-transform infrared (GC/FTIR) system, which is one of the
              primary instruments to be used in a new laboratory course entitled Analysis of
              Complex Mixtures in Complex Media. Used in conjunction with existing department
              analytical equipment and a microwave digestion unit provided by a local
              manufacturer, this instrument permits faculty to implement a program in which
              undergraduate chemistry majors are taught the laboratory techniques necessary
              to perform organic analysis of complex systems such as soils, water, biological
              samples, food, and other multicomponent mixtures. The purpose of this is to
              provide undergraduates, especially those whose terminal degrees are a
              bachelor's, the skills necessary to perform well in areas such as industrial or
              environmental chemical analysis. The GC/FTIR system plays an important role in
              these types of analysis, since the more popular mass spectrometer (MS) or GC/MS
              techniques often fail to provide the information necessary to distinguish
              between similar compounds (e.g., geometric and substitution isomers) of
              identical molecular weight.
