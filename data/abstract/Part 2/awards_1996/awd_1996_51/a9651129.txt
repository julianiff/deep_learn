Abstract    :
              Since a majority of chemistry and environmental science students enter the
              profession of chemistry by accepting positions in the chemical industry or in
              graduate school, the department is improving its chemistry/biochemistry courses
              by including recent developments in the analysis of industrial, biochemical and
              environmental samples.  Students are using a GC/MS throughout the curriculum in
              new experiments that include teaching both theoretical principles and
              applications of GC/MS.  A new scheme of experiments is being developed to
              connect the chemistry courses to familiar contexts such as common beverages,
              proteins, and pollutants.  The instrument also is being used for undergraduate
              research projects during the academic school year and in the summer.  Seminars
              on GC/MS techniques are being conducted in the ongoing university workshops for
              high school students, teachers, and pre-service teachers.
