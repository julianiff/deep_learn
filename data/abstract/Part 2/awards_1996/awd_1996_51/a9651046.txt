Abstract    :
               This project uses MacLab physiological recording equipment as part of a
              comprehensive three-phase plan designed to strengthen the undergraduate program
              in Biological Sciences.  Phase I (Building Improvement) and Phase II (Upgrade
              of Instructional Aids) have been addressed.  Phase III (Curriculum Enhancement)
              is addressed by this project.  The MacLab recording equipment is being
              integrated into all levels of the curriculum.  Of particular interest is the
              integration of the MacLab into Level III.  Having been introduced to the MacLab
              on a demonstration basis (Level I) and had practical experience in the use of
              the MacLab (Level II), students are required to design, conduct, and present a
              reasonably sophisticated research project using the equipment as part of their
              advanced training (Level III).  The addition of a required research component
              to the undergraduate curriculum is necessary to prepare students adequately for
              postgraduate life as teachers, researchers, and health care practitioners.
