Abstract    :
               This project integrates real-world interdisciplinary activities into targeted
              mathematics and science courses: Introductory Statistics, Algebra/Precalculus,
              General Chemistry, and General Physics. Two computer-equipped classrooms, one
              for mathematics and one for science, are essential for the success of the
              project.   Each classroom provides an environment where students work in teams
              on activities designed to develop problem-solving skills and an understanding
              of course concepts.  Three types of activity are used to meet the objectives of
              the project. TYPE I activities are designed to introduce students to
              problem-solving methodologies using a real-life scenario and an innovative
              problem-solving model called the WHEEL. TYPE II activities involve students
              from one discipline in a direct interaction with students from another
              discipline. TYPE III activities use technology for instruction within a
              specific course. They are designed to guide students in their construction of
              knowledge. The software required for the computer equipped classrooms (10
              computers each) are Minitab, a statistics package; Derive, a computer algebra
              system; Quattro-Pro, a spreadsheet program; and PCSOLVE, a general
              problem-solving software package.   This project can serve as a model for
              2-year colleges to integrate a real-world problem-solving learning environment
              into their curriculum.
