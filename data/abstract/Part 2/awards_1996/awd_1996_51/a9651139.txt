Abstract    :
               This project implements major changes in the manner in which computers are
              utilized in the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. Recent developments in
              hardware and software have made data acquisition, data manipulation, and
              molecular mechanics calculations possible at an undergraduate level. This was
              inconceivable 10 years ago and too expensive to consider 5 years ago. The
              project interfaces the major instruments in the department with computers
              equipped with LabVIEW data acquisition and handling software, installs a local
              area network for data transport, and creates a workstation area with
              site-licensed molecular modeling, scientific graphing, and statistical
              packages. Laboratories that are most affected by these additions include
              organic chemistry, physical chemistry, analytical chemistry, instrumental
              analysis, inorganic chemistry, and the undergraduate research program.
              Molecular modeling of chemical systems can be introduced extensively in organic
              lab and reinforced with increasing sophistication in the subsequent courses.
              This program provides a cost-effective model for the integration of computer
              technology into the chemistry curriculum of a medium-sized college. The
              project's effectiveness is being evaluated by an external agent chosen from the
              American Chemical Society's College Consultants Service.
