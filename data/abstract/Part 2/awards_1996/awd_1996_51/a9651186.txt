Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at Mt. San Antonio College has begun revitalizing
              its calculus courses by integrating, as the available technology permits, some
              of the curricular modifications recommended in the recent NCTM standards.
              Unfortunately, the Statistics and Business Calculus courses, which are required
              for all Business Management students and is recommended for all other
              Management Science students, have not been significantly altered from the
              traditional lecture format. In conversations with Business faculty at
              neighboring 4-year universities and with former students, it has become
              apparent that there is a need for an overhaul of the present courses. As a
              means of addressing the problem, this project seeks to establish a multimedia
              computer classroom/laboratory and a multimedia presentation classroom, allowing
              for a complete restructuring of Business Calculus and Statistics courses. This
              restructuring includes multimedia presentation of course materials, continuous
              curriculum development through student projects and presentations, and ongoing
              student-generated development of an Internet-accessible Multimedia
              Problems/Solutions Bank. This project is intended to make Business Calculus and
              Statistics more "problem/solution" oriented with an emphasis placed on actual
              data and problems derived from real business settings.
