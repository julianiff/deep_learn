Abstract    :
               The Chemistry and Biology Departments have jointly collaborated on the
              implementation of a new major in biochemistry. Included in the degree plan is a
              course in molecular biology taught in the Biology Department and two courses in
              biochemistry taught in the Chemistry Department, each with a 3-hour lab. This
              project addresses the need to outfit the newly designed biochemistry laboratory
              components and enhance the existing molecular biology course through the
              acquisition of a capillary electrophoresis (CE) unit, used in conjunction with
              an existing high-performance liquid chromatograph.   Already a common
              analytical tool in several science disciplines, CE has the advantages of
              possessing an efficiency similar to that of capillary gas chromatography,
              requiring only minute sample amounts, and the applicability to a wide range of
              analytes from small ions to large biomolecules. The unit is also easily
              automated for precise quantitative analysis and ease of use. Experiments
              involving analysis of oligonucleotide size, molecular weight determination, and
              tryptic protein fragment separation have been developed for these labs.
              Students also have access to this instrument for undergraduate research
              projects.
