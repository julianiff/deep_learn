Abstract    :
               While computers have revolutionized introductory mathematics and statistics
              courses, students often find that more advanced courses do not take full
              advantage of the new approaches and training that they have received. However,
              powerful and user-friendly software for visualizing complex geometric relations
              and for typesetting mathematical documents is now available to be used
              effectively in middle- and upper-level undergraduate courses.   The objective
              of this project is to prepare mathematics majors to address large problems_such
              as understanding the motion of a drum_using computers. Computer graphics help
              students visualize a problem, and mathematical typesetting tools allow them to
              synthesize their understanding by writing documents that incorporate text,
              graphics, and mathematical formulations. This project concentrates on three
              intermediate- and advanced-level courses in the calculus sequence and three
              more in statistics. The department is developing modules for class discussion
              and exploration using computers and disseminating them through the Web site and
              the FTP site maintained by the mathematics department, as well as through
              presentations to meetings of the Mathematical Association of America and the
              American Statistical Association.
