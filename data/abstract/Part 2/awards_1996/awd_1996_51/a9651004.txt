Abstract    :
              Laboratory courses are offered to accompany content courses in Cognitive
              Psychology and Psychology of Perception. The requested instructional scientific
              equipment was selected for its versatility for performing a wide variety of
              psychology experiments and its ease of use for students. These laboratory
              courses provide expanded opportunities for undergraduate psychology majors to
              actively participate in the SCIENCE of psychology.  Students are introduced to
              the application of the scientific method to a content area of interest to them.
               They replicate experiments they are reading and hearing about in their content
              course, and ultimately design, carry out, and present in a research conference
              format an original research study.  These courses benefit women and minority
              students particularly, since these students have shown a clear preference for
              enrolling in psychology courses rather than other science areas.  Thus
              laboratory experiences in psychology can serve as a gateway to the sciences for
              traditionally underrepresented groups.
