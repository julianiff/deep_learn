Abstract    :
               Acquisition of an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (uv-vis) is having a
              significant impact on the undergraduate chemistry curricula. Educational
              opportunities are being significantly enhanced in 11 existing courses,
              including Quantitative Analysis, Instrumental Analysis, Organic Chemistry,
              Biochemistry, Physical Chemistry for the Life Sciences, Physical Chemistry,
              Advanced Inorganic, Advanced Biochemistry, Advanced Organic, Organic
              Spectroscopy, and Elements of Research. The combination of fast spectral
              acquisition, fast data evaluation, and report generation provides a powerful
              and productive system. Collecting data at simultaneous wavelengths for kinetic
              experiments, variable temperature control, and the capability of a broader
              wavelength range can lead to the incorporation of new experiments in the
              laboratory and ultimately strengthen the curriculum. The instrument can be used
              in workshops that include high school students and teachers and college
              students and instructors from nearby community colleges.
