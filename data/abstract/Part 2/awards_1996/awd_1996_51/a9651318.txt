Abstract    :
               This project provides assistance in improving laboratory instruction in
              introductory physics courses. Faculty believe that many students in these
              courses fail to develop adequate understanding of the basic concepts presented.
                Therefore, this project addresses the identified reasons for this failure: 
              students are not (l) actively involved in the design of experiments; (2)
              sufficiently engaged in small group, collaborative learning; (3) receiving
              feedback on the results of many experiments; or (4) using their laboratory time
              efficiently and for laboratory-dependent activities.   This project is making
              improvements in laboratory instruction by revising the curricula of two
              introductory physics courses and integrating the use of microcomputer-based
              laboratory tools into the laboratory component of those courses.   Students
              taking the physics courses improved by this project are in majors that prepare
              them for work as technicians in manufacturing, engineering, or technical
              service environments.   This project can serve as a model for the instruction
              of physics to college students in technical programs.  Evaluation of both
              program improvements and student outcomes can be conducted as part of the
              project.
