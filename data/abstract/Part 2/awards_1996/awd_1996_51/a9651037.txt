Abstract    :
               The Department of Chemistry is revising its entire upper-level undergraduate
              physical chemistry curriculum and is introducing a new Computational Chemistry
              Laboratory Course to be required of the 60 to 100 chemistry and biochemistry
              majors graduated each year and to be elected by a number of chemical
              engineering and cellular/molecular biology majors. The object of this new
              course is to acquaint the students through hands-on experience with three major
              areas of computational chemistry, namely the use of symbolic mathematics
              programs in manipulating and graphing analytic relationships, the use of
              semi-empirical and ab initio electronic structure programs in studying
              molecular energies and structures, and the use of molecular modeling programs
              in further characterizing molecular structures and reaction processes. To this
              end, this project provides support for the acquisition of a set of 21 Macintosh
              PowerMac computers and the necessary software packages. The equipment is being
              housed in newly renovated laboratory space in the Science Learning Center
              (located in the Chemical Sciences Laboratory) and Ethernetted to the
              Departmental Computing Facility with its high-end workstations and electronic
              structure software. Through their computational chemistry laboratory
              experiences, the students can gain skills and insights that enhance their
              lecture course and conventional laboratory studies of physical chemistry.
