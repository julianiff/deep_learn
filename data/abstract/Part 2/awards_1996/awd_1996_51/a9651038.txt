Abstract    :
               This project uses equipment to address a curricular need that exists in this
              department and in physics programs nationwide. One of the express goals of
              introductory physics courses is to prepare students to apply physics to the
              world around them. Students should be capable of thoughtfully performing
              back-of-the-envelope calculations to reach valid conclusions about physics as
              it is observed. Rarely, if ever, do teachers validate this skill by testing
              students. The outcomes of those tests that have been employed are
              disappointing. Therefore, this department is developing methods to ensure
              greater student skill in these estimation processes.    If students are going
              to learn to make valid estimations, they need to practice. It is crucial that
              they have quick feedback about the accuracy of their estimates. To this end,
              eight computer-based data acquisition systems are being used along with
              suitable probes and modeling software. Together with structured learning
              activities, this hardware provides the immediate feedback that is needed to
              develop student skills in estimation. Simple modeling exercises enable the
              students to discover which aspects of the problem are most critical.   Because
              of the growing numbers of physics classes with access to microcomputer based
              labs (MBL), the tools and resources developed are easily transportable to
              schools nationwide.
