Abstract    :
               This project involves developing a curriculum revision to increase students'
              experience with modern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The
              modifications are giving all chemistry majors earlier exposure to this
              fundamental spectroscopic tool and are expanding their experiences to include
              more modern FT-NMR applications. Five computers, an air dryer, and NMR
              processing software are allowing off-line PC processing of NMR data and
              enhancing the variable temperature capabilities of the department's FT-NMR
              spectrometer.   Students have opportunities to work directly with NMR data
              beginning in the sophomore year. They gain experience with processing NMR data
              and learn to operate the spectrometer and apply it to a variety of chemical
              problems. Experiments involve investigation of dynamic processes and the use of
              spectral simulation to analyze second-order spectra. Computerized problem
              assignments supplement the laboratory applications at each step.   The
              experiments, NMR data sets, and computer exercises are valuable in other 4-year
              educational settings, and the data sets and computer exercises are applicable
              at 2-year institutions and other sites lacking an NMR spectrometer.
