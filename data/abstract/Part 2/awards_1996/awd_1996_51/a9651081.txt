Abstract    :
              The primary goal of this project is to transform the traditional manual
              cartography lab into a modern computer cartography lab. In the process,
              secondary goals of providing Internet access to a wide range of Geography and
              Environmental Studies students as well as updating the existing facilities used
              for teaching GIS have been set. These goals are being achieved by establishing
              a 14-seat LAN computing lab. A variety of software packages are being installed
              that will give cartography students exposure to the full range of applications
              currently associated with the field of cartography. In addition, each
              workstation in the lab can be assigned its own IP address and connected,
              through the universities larger network, to the Internet. The primary audience
              being affected by this project is upper-division geography and environmental
              studies majors. The impact of this project can be evaluated based on student
              testing and employer interviews.
