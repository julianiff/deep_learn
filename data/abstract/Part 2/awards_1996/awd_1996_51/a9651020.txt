Abstract    :
               This project is designed to remove the obstacles that discourage capable
              students from continuing to study physics. It is using microcomputer-based
              laboratories (MBL) as a platform to provide a more effective learning
              environment to aid all students, even students who are science deficient or who
              have never been provided the opportunity to study physics. These MBL
              experiments and activities cover the majority of the topics taught in a
              traditional two-semester introductory physics course. The classroom is
              completely mobile to allow instruction in a variety of settings. It uses a file
              server network system, laptop computers, Universal Laboratory Interfaces, and a
              variety of interfacing probes.    The project is allowing increased access to
              physics education for students in rural areas using an interactive television
              (ITV) system with two-way video and audio.
