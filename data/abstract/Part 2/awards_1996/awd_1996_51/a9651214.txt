Abstract    :
              This project is designed to improve the quality of undergraduate instruction in
              GEOS 240, Environmental Monitoring and other courses required in the
              Environmental Science major and related majors. Students are learning
              state-of-the-art techniques for monitoring nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon.
              Upon successful completion of GEOS 240, students undertake a semester-long
              internship with the Chico Environmental Laboratory using the same
              instrumentation as used in GEOS 240. Students have the opportunity to integrate
              classroom theory and refine instrument techniques with practical hands-on
              experience on real projects in a certified state lab, under the guidance of
              professionals. They also have the opportunity to use the equipment in
              individual research projects. The project also involves the expansion of the
              Lachat ion analyzer to accommodate the analysis of several ions of
              environmental concern, a total organic carbon analyzer to determine the amount
              of inorganic and organic carbon in soil and water, and a steam sterilizer for
              the cleaning of glassware. The changes in the program can result in a more
              relevant learning experience, which will better prepare students for the
              growing job market.
