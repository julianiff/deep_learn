Abstract    :
               The use of advanced computer simulation technologies such as finite elements
              has become increasingly common in engineering design. This is especially true
              in linear and structural problems, where the computer tools have developed to
              the point where most graduates of an engineering program can use them on a
              regular basis. Because of the mathematical and physical complexities of fluid
              mechanics, CFD software has not reached this same state of ease of use. In
              spite of the complexities of using CFD, it is becoming increasingly clear that
              engineering undergraduates must have some exposure to the technique.   The
              objective of this project is to develop a national model for appropriate
              integration of CFD into an undergraduate curriculum to support the design
              process. This is being accomplished through a series of projects in several
              different courses. All students in the program are exposed to the fundamentals
              of CFD to learn its strengths and limitations, and those who have an interest
              have the opportunity to develop an expertise in using the software. This is
              done in conjunction with experiments using both existing equipment and the
              proposed equipment. This project is part of an overall plan to more intensively
              integrate computers into the curriculum.
