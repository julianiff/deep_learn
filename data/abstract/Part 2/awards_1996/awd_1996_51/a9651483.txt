Abstract    :
              The institution has revised the Bachelor of Arts degree in biology to include a
              greater emphasis on cellular and molecular biology. This emphasis provides
              students with practical experience in the techniques associated with the
              rapidly expanding field of biotechnology. The predominantly Hispanic (86 %) and
              female (62 %) students depend upon the hands-on experiences provided by the
              laboratory portions of their biology courses to improve their chances for
              success in employment and acceptance to postgraduate programs. Specific plant
              biotechnology laboratories are now  designed to introduce junior and senior
              level biology students to cell disruption, differential centrifugation, DNA
              extraction, gel electrophoresis, genetic fingerprinting by the polymerase chain
              reaction (PCR), protoplast fusion, and transformation of plant genome by Ti
              plasmids. Project equipment is also shared by students in undergraduate
              independent study research courses.
