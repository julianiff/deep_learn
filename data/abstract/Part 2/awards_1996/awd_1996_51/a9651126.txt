Abstract    :
              Students majoring in mathematics, students majoring in fields that require
              substantial amounts of mathematics, or students planning on teaching
              mathematics need the technological expertise to be successful in their careers.
              The objective of this project is to provide a technologically enriched
              environment in order to carry out activities that give students the expertise
              with appropriate software for understanding mathematics, solving problems, and
              accessing information through networks such as the world wide web. To carry out
              this objective we are obtaining twenty computers for student use, along with
              appropriate instructor equipment and printers to be included in a modern
              electronic classroom. This equipment will be used in each of the targeted
              courses, Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, and Geometry, to
              carry out exploratory activities and integrated projects. The appropriate use
              of technology is especially important in a minority institution such as Western
              New Mexico University. Students that have traditionally been underrepresented
              in mathematics and science will be given opportunities to explore mathematical
              ideas and problem solving in ways that allow full participation in a
              cooperative learning environment. The activities and projects developed in this
              project will be made available through presentations at national, regional, and
              local meetings as well as through regional workshops.
