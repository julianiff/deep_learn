Abstract    :
               Because of the large student response to the Molecular Genetics and Microbial
              Ecology courses in the Biology curriculum, this project designed a
              collaborative project centered around the theory of the two courses and the
              combined expertise of faculty and students. The pilot project included the
              isolation and purification of coliphages from sewage followed by enzyme
              restriction analyses of coliphage DNA. Newly purchased instruments now enhance
              and expand this project to include the isolation, restriction mapping, and
              polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA. Students are also able
              to conduct qualitative analyses with the acquisition of DNA sequencing
              capabilities and quantitative analyses using an optical densitometer. With the
              new equipment, students are able to conduct modern techniques including PCR
              amplification of DNA, Southern blotting, probe hybridization, DNA sequencing,
              and chemiluminescent probing. These capabilities can greatly increase students'
              understanding of genetic theory and phylogeny and can also enable students to
              learn how to generate molecular markers to be used in genetic and microbial
              investigations. A knowledge of these techniques is essential to the success of
              students in their research projects, in their future studies, and in an
              increasingly technical world.
