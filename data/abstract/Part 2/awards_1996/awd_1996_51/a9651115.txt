Abstract    :
              This project will develop an integrated computer laboratory for general science
              education at Palomar College.  The project involves design, implementation, and
              evaluation of an integrative curriculum for three cohorts of students enrolled
              in the designated general education biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy,
              geography, geology, and oceanography classes. Organized around the theme of
              oceanography, collaborative research projects and daily assignments are
              integrating industry-related curricula into introductory science courses and
              addressing career awareness and student interactions with the professional
              scientific community. The computer lab is bridging scientific theory with
              industry applications. The project is facilitating student learning in an open
              computer lab environment. It also provides a model for a four-part faculty
              enhancement program. Faculty have the opportunity to develop relationships with
              scientists and others in industry, integrate curriculum, and develop learning
              communities. A Teacher's Resource Guide and a train-the-trainer program are
              ensuring local and national project information dissemination.
