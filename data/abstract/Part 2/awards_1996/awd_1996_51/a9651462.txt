Abstract    :
               The objective of this project is to introduce the concepts of environmental
              analysis, monitoring, and management through remote sensing (RS) and geographic
              information system (GIS) techniques. The project is also incorporating mapping
              concepts from digital images which serve as the spatial foundation for RS and
              GIS. Applications and student projects that are developing under this project
              stress special settings in an urban area such as Newark, New Jersey.   An
              example of a student project is to identify and map potential hazardous waste
              sites within the metropolitan area. For these objectives, there is a need for
              new RS software and equipment that is being installed in, and is expanding, the
              capabilities of the newly established PC-Laboratory.   The results of this
              project will directly affect the Civil and Environmental Engineering,
              Environmental Science, and Surveying Engineering Technology Departments. The
              laboratory will also serve students from neighboring Rutgers-Newark University
              and Essex County College. These higher education institutions have a
              cross-registration policy to minimize duplication of courses and to share
              resources. A substantial number of students at all of these institutions are
              inner city, first generation students.
