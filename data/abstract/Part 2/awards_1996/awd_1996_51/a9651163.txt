Abstract    :
              A model is being developed for the introduction of technology into chemistry
              laboratories in small, rural institutions of higher education. To accomplish
              this goal, ten state-of-the-art computers are being networked together in the
              chemistry laboratory. These computers are being interfaced with balances and
              spectrophotometers, and with pH/ion meters already owned by the department. All
              of the computers are equipped with CD-ROM drives for use as data sources, and
              the network includes three printers. Students use spreadsheet programs for
              recording and management of laboratory data. They use Maple V algebra
              instructional software for working problems in class, and the program is
              available to students and mathematics classes when chemistry classes are not
              using the laboratory. This exposure to Maple also prepares students for more
              sophisticated use of the program at the university level. A molecular modeling
              program is installed on the system, making it possible to add new experiments
              in both General Chemistry I and General Chemistry II. Students are becoming
              comfortable with the use of computers as scientific and data
              analysis/management tools while they experience new and exciting ways to
              conduct chemistry experiments. This cross-curricular, applied learning approach
              benefits mathematics students as well as those enrolled in chemistry classes.
              Oral presentations at ACS regional and national meetings will disseminate
              results of the proposal's implementation, and an article will be submitted to
              the Journal of Chemical Education.
