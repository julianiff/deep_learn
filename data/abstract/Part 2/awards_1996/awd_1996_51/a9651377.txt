Abstract    :
              This interdisciplinary project will develop experiments for undergraduate
              students in chemistry, geology and physics to use surface analysis and imaging
              techniques to characterize materials. Presently, Ball State University has a
              scanning electron microscope used by the three departments. The acquisition of
              an x-ray detector for the existing electron microscope will facilitate
              quantitative analysis and elemental maps of samples. The chemistry department
              operates an infrared microscope. The addition of an attenuated total
              reflectance objective will allow information about molecular or crystalline
              structure to be obtained on a wide variety of surfaces. These two techniques,
              which provide complementary elemental and molecular information, will offer the
              student an integrated and superb application of the fascinating theories of the
              behavior of electrons, atoms, and molecules. Practically speaking, these
              experiments will broaden the experience of the chemistry, geology and physics
              students. They can use surface analysis as an analytical technique while
              preparing themselves for future opportunities in research and industrial
              applications.
