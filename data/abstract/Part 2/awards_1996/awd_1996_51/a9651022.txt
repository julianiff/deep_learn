Abstract    :
               X-ray diffraction has long been a standard technique for mineral
              identification. Improvements in modern instruments and major advances in the
              versatility of software have expanded the potential uses of X-ray
              diffractometers (XRDs) to include undergraduate instruction and student
              research in a variety of geological topics. This project involves acquisition
              of an XRD and enhancement of research opportunities for undergraduates. This
              project allows the geology department to require senior research problems to
              include analytical data. Integration of data from modern laboratory instruments
              with theory and field observations is essential because analytical
              instrumentation has become fundamental to the current practice of geoscience.
              The XRD is a major component of the Mineralogy and Petrology course sequence
              required of all geology majors, and essential applications of XRD are being
              introduced to undergraduates in other courses.
