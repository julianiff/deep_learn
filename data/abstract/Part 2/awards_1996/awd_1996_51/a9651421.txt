Abstract    :
               With the addition of new faculty in 1990 and 1993, the Department of Biology
              began an effort to expand its educational and research programs in organismal
              animal biology. Laboratory courses in Neurobiology and Advanced Physiological
              Ecology (Seminar) were added to the curriculum in 1993 and changes in the
              Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy and Animal Physiology courses increased
              students' experience with investigational laboratories. These changes have been
              accompanied by a tremendous increase in students enrolling in these courses
              (from 38 in 1990-91 to 88 in 1994-95). The need for laboratory equipment to
              support and continue these curriculum improvements has been intensified by the
              increase in student enrollment.   This project obtains the equipment necessary
              to provide modern investigative laboratory experiences for two courses in
              vertebrate form and function (currently Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy and
              Animal Physiology) and to supplement the offerings in neurobiology and advanced
              physiology seminar. The equipment allows increasing numbers of students the
              opportunity to work in small groups to design and carry out meaningful
              investigations using an array of basic laboratory techniques. These laboratory
              courses each reflect the investigative nature of biology, as well as promote
              the integration of information and research methods used to study animal
              biology on numerous levels of organization. The Biology Department has a vital
              and rigorous program, and a large proportion of students continue their
              education in professional and graduate programs. The department also emphasizes
              the potential vocations in biological industries through vigorous career
              counseling. The investment in high-quality investigative laboratories in
              organismal biology that this project provides ensures that students will be
              better prepared to meet their own educational objectives with problem-solving
              and investigative skills.
