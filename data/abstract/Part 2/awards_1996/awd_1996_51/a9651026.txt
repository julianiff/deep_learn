Abstract    :
               Many science and engineering students take a course on modern physics without
              taking the modern physics laboratory. This exposition to the experimental
              foundations of modern physics is far from adequate. To correct this problem, we
              propose to add an interactive component to the modern physics class: a set of
              computer exercises designed to simulate key modern physics experiments. 
              Simulated experiments in quantization (e.g., photoelectric effect), scattering
              (e.g., Rutherford), and quantum mechanics (e.g., Stern-Gerlach) will be
              designed and developed at UTEP. The simulations will give students direct
              control of input variables, access to output data and to analysis tools for a
              rapid study of the results. A manual will be written to accompany the software.
               The use of the simulations will be tested at UTEP and New Mexico State
              University. The modules will be later implemented in UTEP's modern physics
              course. Assessment and evaluation of the simulations will be done at the
              student and faculty level and by a consultant.  Physics departments serving
              science and engineering colleges will benefit from the product of this
              proposal. For greater compatibility, the simulations will be developed for
              MacIntosh and PC systems. In particular, community colleges and institutions
              with small laboratory facilities will find the simulations useful. Implementing
              the teaching tools at UTEP will greatly benefit minority students.
