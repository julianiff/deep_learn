Abstract    :
              This proposal for the "development of integrated laboratories in geography"
              seeks $ 60,772 (from the NSF and internal resources) to establish, improve, and
              integrate the laboratories in the Department of Geography and Urban Studies on
              the main campus of Temple University. The goals are to (1) establish a
              laboratory for Physical Geography (PGLAB), (2) improve existing laboratories
              for Cartography (CARTLAB) and Geographic Information Systems (GISLAB), and (3)
              integrate the three laboratories physically and through teaching and research
              projects. In the three labs, students will learn the use of maps as models of
              the physical and built environment, create and import digital spatial and
              attribute data (through scanning, digitizing, image analysis, data conversion
              routines, etc.), transform the acquired data to appropriate projections and
              scales, create professional level output (in the CARTLAB), and conduct spatial
              analysis using overlays (in the PGLAB and GISLAB). The MacIntosh based CARTLAB
              facilities will be expanded, the 486 33 PCs currently serving the GISLAB will
              be moved to the PGLAB and replaced with Pentium 133's. In addition, some data,
              peripherals (for networking and data storage), and updated software licenses
              will be acquired. The PGLAB will serve as the primary point of entry and
              exposure to the world of digital mapping and spatial analysis through an
              University-wide core course on the physical environment. Interested students
              will then further specialize in mapping in the CARTLAB, and/or analysis in the
              GISLAB. Eighteen courses (including seven graduate undergraduate cross-listed
              courses) that will be wholly or partially taught in the labs are offered. Each
              year about 200 students, including about 140 undergraduate students, will
              receive training in and be familiarized with the use of computers in geography
              in the three teaching labs.
