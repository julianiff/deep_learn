Abstract    :
               This project is designed to upgrade the technology used in the Geographic
              Information Systems (GIS) program. In 1994, the university purchased three Sun
              Microsystem Sparcstations and ARC/INFO software. The U.S. Forest Service loaned
              a pen plotter to the university to supplement the project. Although the memory
              has been doubled recently to 32 megabytes, student projects involving large
              databases still prove to be a frustrating experience. Large databases are
              difficult to manipulate because of limited memory. When the existing plotter is
              returned to the Forest Service, the students would not be able to view
              completed work except on a computer monitor. The limitations of existing
              technology would negatively affect the potential of the GIS program. Therefore,
              the funds for this project are being devoted to the purchase of a
              Hewlett-Packard 650C plotter and to increase the RAM on each workstation to 96
              megabytes. This equipment helps provide students with real-world projects based
              on local and regional needs and interests.
