Abstract    :
               The Department of Psychology is improving its core course offerings for
              undergraduate students. The department has a large number of psychology majors
              (750), composing a large percentage (8 percent) of the total student
              population. The primary focus of this project is to strengthen the three-course
              research sequence_introductory statistics, introductory experimental, and
              advanced experimental classes_that all majors are required to complete. Initial
              analysis has indicated that undergraduate students have limited statistical
              skills and virtually no systematic exposure to computerized stimulus
              generation, design implementation, or data analysis. Until recently, the
              department has had no lab facilities for classroom use. The department is now
              purchasing 27 IBM-compatible workstations networked to a 80586 server and five
              printers. The statistical and experimental software supports students'
              understanding of the crucial principles of the experimental process, including
              the generation of stimuli, collection of data, and analysis of data. Further,
              the equipment helps the faculty prepare undergraduate students for graduate
              school.
