Abstract    :
               A system-wide confocal microscope core facility is being established to serve
              students and faculty throughout the state. The facility can be involved through
              several avenues, including on-site visitation and remote operation using
              high-speed networking protocols such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode and
              Integrated Services Digital Networks. The computer-controlled confocal
              microscope is maintained in a shared resource center and is being incorporated
              into undergraduate curricula to teach dynamic cellular processes in biological
              applications. The basis of confocal microscope theory meshes the disciplines of
              physics, optics, light, computer science, chemistry, and biology into useful
              and aesthetically pleasing images. Faculty and staff expertise can be shared
              among campuses, thus benefiting the many undergraduates enrolled in the
              university system. Accomplishments generated from the core facility can be
              disseminated through various methods, including workshops in confocal
              microscopy, student and faculty presentations and publications, and the
              development of image databases and curricular material available through the
              World Wide Web. The resource material is available throughout the university
              system, as well as to the K through 14 schools and the scientific community at
              large.
