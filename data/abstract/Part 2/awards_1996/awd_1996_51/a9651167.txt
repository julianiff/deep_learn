Abstract    :
               This project addresses the acquisition of equipment for project-oriented
              open-schedule laboratories and learning support facilities for
              interdisciplinary science courses. The institution now offers three
              interdisciplinary science courses for education majors and an interdisciplinary
              core science sequence of two courses that is being developed under a current
              National Science Foundation grant. The new equipment is being used in
              conjunction with these five courses. Experience gained in these laboratories
              can ultimately be used as a basis for the development of laboratories and
              learning support facilities that will be used by all education majors and by
              all students taking core science courses. This project deals with a number of
              common problems in undergraduate laboratory science, including the efficient
              use of space, equipment, and personnel; the difficulties of applying active
              learning techniques under the constraints imposed by large class sizes; and the
              need to improve science literacy and process skills to national levels.
