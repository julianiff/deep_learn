Abstract    :
               The Mathematics Department is enhancing the quality of instruction in the
              Algebra, Precalculus, and Calculus courses by acquiring sets of graphing
              calculators (TI-80s, TI-85s, and TI-92s) and a laptop computer for use in these
              classes. From their research into current trends in mathematics education,
              their communication with mathematics educators through the internet, and
              through regional and national conferences, the members of the Mathematics
              Department recognize that the lack of modern technology available to these
              classes constitutes a serious deficiency in the mathematics education program
              at the college and creates a disadvantage for its students. It is the goal of
              the Mathematics Department to offer the most comprehensive and up-to-date
              program available to meet the academic needs of a highly diverse student
              population, including a high percentage of financially disadvantaged students
              (34 percent of the student population is on financial aid). To implement this
              goal, the department is purchasing the necessary technological equipment for
              student use. The hope is that, at the end of one semester, `students will use
              appropriate technology to enhance their mathematical thinking and understanding
              and to solve mathematical problems and judge the reasonableness of their
              results` (Crossroads in Mathematics, AMATYC).
