Abstract    :
               This project answers the question, How can additional material be added to the
              undergraduate curricula without the addition or subtraction of courses? The
              thesis is that the inclusion of lecture-laboratories is one way of
              accomplishing this goal. To evaluate this thesis, the project teaches catalysis
              at more than a cursory degree at the undergraduate level by including a related
              set of laboratory-based homework assignments as part of the senior-level
              chemical engineering kinetics course.   However, for this goal to be achieved,
              it is absolutely necessary that the laboratory apparatus be user-friendly, have
              the capability of demonstrating the important concepts in catalysis, and be
              compatible with short, focused assignments. All of these attributes are
              features of the compact, flexible apparatus being used here. Not only can
              students be exposed to basic catalysis background in the lecture-laboratories,
              but the equipment is also totally compatible with the open-ended 6- to 8-week
              laboratory assignments that characterize the Unit Operations Laboratory course.
                This project serves as a potential model for addressing similar problems in
              other engineering disciplines. Finally, it should be pointed out that this
              particular project is totally compatible with the recent commitment on the part
              of the Chemical Engineering Department to totally rethink and refurbish its
              undergraduate laboratories.
