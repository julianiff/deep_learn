Abstract    :
                   The purpose of the project is to design a national model for multivariable
              calculus lab instruction which integrates the use of computers and the
              mathematical programs MAPLE V and MATHEMATICA into the teaching and learning of
              calculus. With the aid of this technology, students can move more quickly
              towards the application of ideas to problem solving.  The following was
              completed in Phase I of the project, supported by NSF award # 9452422:     1)
              creation of a public domain MAPLE library that contains various custom programs
              for the learning and teaching of multivariable calculus. This will be an
              electronic marketplace where experienced and inexperienced instructors can
              exchange ideas and experience.   2) developmelt  of Lab Manuals which will
              demonstrate how to use the customized MAPLE programs in the proposed library
              and help the inexperienced instructor to develop a computer instruction lab.   
                    The focus of "Phase II of the project" will be:     1) development of the
              MATHEMATICA version of the project, and   2) dissemination of materials and 
              results found in class-testing.
