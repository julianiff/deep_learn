Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to reform the chemistry laboratory curriculum at
              Sage JCA in Albany, NY by incorporating hands-on student use of microcomputers.
              To accomplish this goal, funding is sought for eight Power Mac computers, eight
              set-ups of computer interface plus probes/sensors, a variety of software
              packages, and cable for networking. The networked computer workstations along
              with existing instruments will allow for 1. an increase of student awareness of
              the capabilities of the microcomputer as an instrument of chemistry; 2. an
              enhancement of traditional teaching techniques currently used; 3. an increase
              in the diversity of experiments and simulations which may be performed by
              students; 4. an increase in student interest and understanding of the nature of
              measurements and of the principles of chemistry; 5. an increase in student
              appreciation of the role of technology in acquiring useful information; 6. an
              increase in student's computer literacy skills. Acquisition of the proposed
              equipment will impact all of the chemistry course offerings at Sage Junior
              College of Albany. Computer-assisted experiments and simulations are proposed
              to enable students to acquire, analyze and display data in a variety of
              different and exciting ways. These activities can help students to investigate
              phenomena and perform calculations rapidly and transparently to look for trends
              and inconsistencies in experimental data. This experience will provide students
              with relevant skills and improved abilities as they enter an increasingly
              technological world where knowledge-intensive job skills are necessary to
              compete for careers.
