Abstract    :
              This project involves student laboratory in comparative animal physiology that
              incorporates learning into a modern experimental process. This may contrast
              with instructional laboratories at other institutions that rely heavily upon
              observational exercises to teach students about physiological concepts.
              Selected topics of current interest in comparative physiology research are
              emphasized, and the laboratories provide students with hands-on experience in
              the use of modern equipment and techniques. Three sequences address major
              physiological principles. These include informative and experimental
              laboratories, as well as computer-interfacing microelectrodes,  electrophoresis
              based analyses, and computer-assisted data analysis. Also, students involved in
              the project are encouraged to present papers and submit research articles  for
              publication in scientific journals.
