Abstract    :
               The converging technologies of telecommunications, computers, and media are
              creating new businesses, new jobs, and new courses of study at technical and
              community colleges. Students need access to digital TV, multimedia, wireless,
              community server, public kiosk, and audience feedback technologies in order to
              become builders of future information infrastructure, a new national priority
              with local and regional economic development and community building potential. 
               This project, which equips students in this area of advanced technological
              education, has been organized within the framework of a new networking
              communication (NetCo) curriculum that both draws upon and contributes to
              building rural community networks (CoNets).   Some of the equipment for this
              project goes into college electronic labs, computer labs, and video production
              studios for NetCo students pursuing three study options:  communication
              technology, multimedia software, and interactive television. Equipment can also
              be shared through links into and among rural communities, which make up a CoNet
              model. This model involves spread spectrum transceivers on antenna towers and
              public kiosks in various local sites.   This CoNet model_impacting handicapped,
              elderly, young, and especially rurally remote families_includes new RAN (rural
              area network) wireless links among LANs, WANs and MANs. Mayors, school
              superintendents, teachers, librarians, county agents, and business people
              attended week-long summer workshops to learn how to initiate CoNets locally and
              regionally in 1995. In 1996-97, 60 faculty statewide can learn to use this
              equipment in support of NetCo curriculum.
