Abstract    :
               The purpose of this project is to introduce atomic absorption spectrophotometry
              as an analytical tool into eight lower-division undergraduate laboratory
              science courses in the areas of chemistry, physical science, earth science,
              geology, anatomy and physiology, and nutrition.  The technique can be used for
              the quantitation of metals in water samples, fossils, food samples, and
              simulated clinical specimens.  Students served in the intended courses include
              majors in elementary education at the baccalaureate level, nursing at both the
              baccalaureate and associate-degree levels, and the associate-degree level
              college transfer programs and occupation/technical programs. A significant
              number of students enroll in the involved courses to satisfy general education
              requirements, so the project should have an impact on improving general science
              literacy as well as improving the scope and quality of required courses in a
              few selected major areas.
