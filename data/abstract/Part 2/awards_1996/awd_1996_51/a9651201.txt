Abstract    :
               This project has four major objectives:  (1) to improve the laboratory
              experience of the students in general, analytical, and environmental chemistry
              by providing an atomic absorption (AA) spectrometer for trace metal
              analysis--this instrument enables the department to give students practical
              experience working with a powerful analytical tool on problems that have great
              intrinsic interest; (2) to provide broader opportunities for upper-level
              biology and environmental science students conducting field and laboratory
              research; (3) to enhance the scope of senior research projects, making possible
              more quantitative studies and encouraging the development of collaborative
              projects; and (4) to provide an important instrumental resource that enriches
              the experience of students participating in an environmental internship
              program, working in cooperation with the Portland Water District, the Maine
              Department of Environmental Resources, and nearby communities.
