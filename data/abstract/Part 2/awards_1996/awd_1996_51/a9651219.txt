Abstract    :
               The purpose of this project is to improve the quality of undergraduate
              chemistry laboratory training for an annual average of 1,800 academically
              heterogeneous students by incorporating a computerized general chemistry
              laboratory in the curriculum. New experiments are being added to the current
              laboratory program. This project also includes the acquisition of 12
              microcomputer systems, a file server, network software, 12 LabWorks Interface
              for data acquisition and control, Excel 5.0 for Windows, an internal modem, and
              a printer. The LabWorks Interface system provides the basic hardware and
              software for data acquisition and management along with eight various probes.  
              These additions allow for an increase in the number of student applications
              using instruments interfaced with computers, allowing computers to perform the
              memory and computational skill to free students to perform intellectual problem
              solving. Furthermore, students have access to computers early in the curricula,
              so that those in the preparatory chemistry course using computers for
              coursework (including graphing, reporting, and data analysis) will continue to
              utilize computers in the subsequent courses, each building on the skills and
              applications learned in the previous course. Finally, this project promotes
              active involvement of the students in the laboratory about the process of
              science as well as the concepts. Students work together in a group on
              open-ended experiments to practice experimental design, data collection and
              analysis, summarizing, and reporting.
