Abstract    :
               This department is expanding its efforts to introduce undergraduates to
              parallel processing concepts in a gradual and nonthreatening manner. Parallel
              processing is discussed for the first time in the first-year Data Structures
              class, in which lectures and several group activities are devoted to parallel
              sorting and a lab assignment involving sorting in parallel is given.
              Appropriate parallel computing topics are also discussed within the Computer
              Organization Principles of Language Design II, Operating Systems, and Analysis
              of Algorithms classes. This plan culminates with the Parallel Computing class
              that is devoted to parallel computing topics. The extended introduction to
              parallel processing enhances the earlier courses and provides a strong
              foundation for the Parallel Computing course.   Four Sun workstations and 16
              PCs are being installed along with software multiprocessor simulators for
              Unix-based workstation and PC environments. When combined with the Computer
              Science Department's existing multiprocessor file server and 16 transputers,
              actual or simulated versions of most of the important multiprocessor parallel
              architectures are available to students.
