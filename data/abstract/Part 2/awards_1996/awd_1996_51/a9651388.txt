Abstract    :
              This project represents a major revision and modernization of the laboratories
              associated with the 2-semester General Physics course sequence. This sequence
              serves 700 students each year and is required by 17 degree programs. These
              programs include biology, chemistry, kinesiology, geosciences, and the
              premedical and pre-physical-therapy curricula, with a combined enrollment of
              1,200 majors, from a highly ethnically diverse student body.    The project
              addresses three curricular deficiencies: insufficient development of students'
              quantitative skills, insufficient development of physical intuition, and
              insufficient relevance for non-physics-majors. All three deficiencies stem from
              the inadequate involvement of the students as active and involved participants
              in the learning process. The computer data acquisition, analysis, and
              simulation approach, coupled with more relevant new experiments, enables
              students to become active, interested learners in the laboratory, not just
              recorders of data. The department is equipping the existing nonmajor
              laboratories with computer stations (one station/two students). Each station
              includes an interface unit and sensors to allow direct computer acquisition of
              such quantities as position, force, temperature, sound, light intensity, and
              magnetic field level. These stations also include a simulation and
              visualization capability using the Interactive Physics II software and CD-ROM
              based visualization materials.     Project experiences and laboratory manuals
              will be shared with the physics community over the World Wide Web and in
              workshops at meetings, as well as through publications and presentations.
