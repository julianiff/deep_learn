Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is committed to improving the biochemical exercises
              in its curriculum. New faculty and courses have been added that require new
              equipment be obtained to upgrade the laboratories. The upgrades will directly
              impact an introductory class for non-science majors, a required course for
              prospective chemistry teachers, two biochemistry courses, undergraduate
              research, and a summer research program for minorities. Acquisition of the
              shaker, incubator and microcentrifuges will help enhance the educational
              experience of the above named courses by adding investigations.
