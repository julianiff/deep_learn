Abstract    :
               The goals of this project are (1) to make possible the implementation of a new
              student-designed human physiology laboratory model which integrates scientific
              inquiry ilto several courses requiring a physiology laboratory and (2) to
              formally assess curricular goals that utilize student-designed laboratories as
              pedagogy. This laboratory model enables students to design their own laboratory
              exercises, collect data, and analyze their data with the use of microcomputer
              technology. The project addresses a number of recommendations from national
              educational associations as its goals. A pilot study was conducted with the
              limited equipment available at the university. While the students learned a
              great deal about methodology, controls, and financial constraints as they
              attempted to create experiments on their own, they were limited by the lack of
              variable gathering instrumentation and more sophisticated data analysis
              capabilities.   The new equipment for this project includes six microcomputers
              with software and transducers to assess cardiac function, brain function by
              wave analysis, muscle function, exercise/fitness-related data, respiratory
              function, skin temperature, and galvonic skin response. In addition, new
              microcomputer-assisted software enables students to take a more active role in
              experimental design. Taking a more active role in designing laboratories
              enables the student to become more acquainted with the scientific process as it
              actually is, i.e., creating the ideas behind the experiments and not simply
              performing a cookbook-type laboratory exercise.
