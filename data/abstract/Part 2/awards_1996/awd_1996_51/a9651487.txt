Abstract    :
               The particle-size distribution (PSD) of sediment reflects the energy of the
              transporting medium (e.g., water or wind), depositional environment, degree of
              chemical weathering, and provenance. Similarly, the concentration of carbon
              (either total, organic, or inorganic) may reflect the balance between elastic
              and biogenic inputs to a lake basin, provenance, dissolution of primary
              carbonate, and eolian influx of carbonate dust to a soil. This project involves
              purchase of a laser diffraction particle-size analyzer and a coulometry-based
              carbon analyzer to enable the integration of quantitative sedimentology into
              three areas of the geology curriculum:  global change, surficial process and
              physical sedimentology, and applied geology. This equipment is increasing the
              significance and scale of independent research projects in these areas. Also,
              the instrumentation enables undergraduates to measure PSD and carbon content
              accurately, precisely, and rapidly with a minimum of laboratory experience.  
              This project is making it possible to further develop research-oriented,
              hands-on laboratory components.
