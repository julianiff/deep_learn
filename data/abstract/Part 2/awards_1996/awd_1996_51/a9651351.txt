Abstract    :
               The undergraduate teaching laboratory serves to expand upon the concepts taught
              in the classroom and demonstrates that science is a dynamic process of
              learning. In order to provide a research environment in its undergraduate
              biochemistry teaching laboratory, the Department of Chemistry has developed a
              curriculum based on investigative learning. The laboratory is based on a
              bioluminescent enzyme known as luciferase. The major objective is to clone the
              luciferase gene and ultimately purify and characterize the enzyme. Thus, the
              student is confronted by a real research problem: how to isolate an enzyme with
              a known function and characterize it. Not only can students learn the
              strategies and techniques used in research, but they can also develop necessary
              critical thinking skills.   The complete development of this laboratory
              curriculum is dependent upon the addition of two luminometers. The luminometer,
              an instrument for detecting photons, is the instrument of choice for the
              measurement of luciferase activity. Quick, reliable measurements of enzyme
              activity are crucial for the purification and subsequent characterization of
              luciferase. The addition of luminometers to the biochemistry laboratory can
              increase the quality of the experiments presented in this course.
