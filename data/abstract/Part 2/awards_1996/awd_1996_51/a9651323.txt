Abstract    :
               The multidisciplinary nature of most environmental problems necessitates
              training in analytical techniques among a variety of students. The acquisition
              of a Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) and growth chamber enhances
              the capabilities for environmental sampling and analysis among students of
              plant biology, invertebrate zoology, biological research methods,
              histology/cell physiology, genetics, and organic chemistry. The majority of
              students are being introduced to the GC/MS system in the organic chemistry
              sequence where they carry out individually designed experiments. The system
              allows for the continued conversion to and increase in the variability of
              microscale experiments and the development of the organic laboratory projects
              that have greatly stimulated student interest in environmental research. As the
              students continue their progress, they use the GC/MS and environmental growth
              chamber in the upper-division biology laboratory courses including the research
              methods course where students design, execute, and present the results of
              individual research projects to peers and faculty. The new equipment also
              allows for the expansion of the undergraduate student-faculty research program
              during both the regular academic year and the summer session.
