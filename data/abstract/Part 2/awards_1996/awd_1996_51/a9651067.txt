Abstract    :
               One of the major goals of the undergraduate laboratory curriculum is to
              graduate physics majors who are familiar with modern instrumentation and
              computer interfacing of this instrumentation so that they are prepared to enter
              a modern industrial or academic research laboratory. Students are required to
              take a course in computer control and computer acquisition and analysis of
              data. Modern instrumentation is required in the advanced undergraduate
              laboratory so that we may build on the training students have received in this
              course.   This project funds the second stage of an upgrading of the advanced
              undergraduate laboratory. It adds two contemporary, condensed-matter
              experiments with computer-interfaced instrumentation:  the two-dimensional
              integer quantum Hall effect and the Josephson effects. The instrumentation
              includes a packaged 5 Tesla magnet with a computer controlled power supply, a
              dewar with a level detector, and associated instrumentation and equipment.  
              Information on experiments set up under this project and their evaluation and
              student response to them can be disseminated and can include a presentation of
              the 2D Hall effect and a dual instructor/student manual.
