Abstract    :
               Project funds are being used to purchase pentium-based PCs and Spartan+ for
              Windows to equip a chemical computation/molecular visualization facility.
              Implementation of this facility enables the university to enhance the
              educational opportunities of students, add depth to course instruction,
              increase faculty exposure to molecular modeling, and lower instructional costs
              through increased availability of the necessary technologies. During the past 4
              years the university has incorporated chemical computation/molecular modeling
              into the undergraduate lecture and laboratory curriculum. Three copies of
              HyperChem run on 486-based PCs. Last year the university acquired a Silicon
              Graphics Indigo2 workstation and Spartan software, which completed the
              development of the program at the senior/independent study level. This project
              enables faculty to use this technology to enrich and enhance the chemical
              education of all students.
