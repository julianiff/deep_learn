Abstract    :
               Geoscientists face increasingly complex problems in the workplace that require
              ever more sophisticated tools. With the large number of graduates finding
              employment in environmental geology, particularly hydrogeology, applied
              geophysical techniques that focus on these fields are of growing importance.
              This institution has developed and taught for 6 years a successful Field
              Geophysics course that emphasizes environmental and hydrological applications.
              This project augments the standard undergraduate teaching suite of geophysical
              instruments (seismograph, gravimeter, magnetometer, and DC electrical
              resistivity) with two electromagnetic sensors that are of emerging importance
              in environmental studies:  a ground-conductivity profiling system and a
              transient-pulse sounder. These instruments give undergraduates experience with
              electromagnetic methods in both the frequency and time domains, allow them to
              investigate a range of relevant environmental problems not previously possible,
              and provide interpretive techniques that are complementary to those used for
              other data.
