Abstract    :
               This project is developing an undergraduate laboratory in the behavioral
              neurosciences to be included as a requirement in the psychology curriculum.
              This laboratory is designed to introduce students to research in the
              neurosciences that spans basic structural neuroanatomy and neurocognitive
              processing. To achieve this end, students complete laboratory exercises that
              encompass three domains:  gross structural neuroanatomy and cell morphology,
              single neuron electrophysiology in simple invertebrate preparations and in
              freely moving rats, and human cognitive psychophysiology. Both traditional
              laboratory and computer-based exercises are designed to reinforce and augment
              the traditional laboratory exercises. Students will also be required to read
              both classic and contemporary papers in the areas covered by the laboratory
              exercises. Approximately 120 students can complete this laboratory each
              academic year.
