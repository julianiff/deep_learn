Abstract    :
              Millikin University Biology Department will use computer- interfaced field data
              collection equipment to expand the kinds of field problems that can be
              addressed by students at all levels, both biology majors, and education majors
              and other non-majors. Accurate, data-logging field sensors of light quality and
              intensity, air and soil temperature, and of dissolved oxygen and temperature at
              various depths of aquatic systems, will be coupled with portable and durable
              field microscopes, night vision glasses, and instrumentation to measure plant
              moisture stress and photosynthesis, for individual and group problem-solving in
              courses using the Lake Sara Retreat Center as a field site. Improved
              environmental measurement systems, plant response meters, and field observation
              tools will provide rapid and unambiguous answers to student-initiated
              questions, reinforcing investigative skills. Students can then focus on the
              scientific thinking involved in formulating and refining hypotheses, designing
              experiments, and interpreting data. This will lead to better understanding of
              processes and therefore better research and/or dissemination of concepts to
              their future students.
