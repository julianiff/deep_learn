Abstract    :
               Capillary electrophoresis is becoming increasingly important as an analytical
              tool in many areas of chemistry and related fields. Several colleges and
              universities have begun to introduce capillary electrophoretic methods into
              their undergraduate programs, but there remains only one published report of
              the use of capillary electrophoresis for undergraduate education.   The project
              begins the process of modernizing the instrumental facilities with the purchase
              of a capillary electrophoresis system with photo diode array detector and
              workstation for data acquisition and analysis. Through the use of this
              instrument, students can be exposed to several areas of chemistry and
              instrumental analysis previously lacking in the department. Laboratory
              exercises are being developed for an instrumental methods laboratory and a
              biochemistry laboratory. The capillary electrophoresis system is also made
              accessible to undergraduates conducting research in chemistry and related
              disciplines.
