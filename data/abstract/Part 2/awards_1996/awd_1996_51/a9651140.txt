Abstract    :
              The project's main objective is to give students in the Microscale Organic
              Laboratory experience with a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer so
              as to better prepare them for careers as scientists and/or science teachers.
              The diverse student population that will benefit from the project includes over
              30% Black and Hispanic students and over 60% female students. In the Microscale
              Organic Laboratory, the spectrometer will be used by students week after week
              to analyze products and characterize unknowns. This will give them concrete
              reinforcement of lecture topics related to infrared spectroscopy.  Interested
              students will analyze byproducts of the reactions they run, and will be asked
              to adapt a synthetic route found in the literature to the microscale level.
              Among other ways, the impact of the project will be evaluated by monitoring
              student progress throughout their post community college education. The
              emergence of microscale chemistry over the past decade has led to a regular
              feature on the subject in the Journal of Chemical Education. This is an
              excellent forum where successes from the project, such as new or adapted
              microscale techniques, will be disseminated to the scientific community.
