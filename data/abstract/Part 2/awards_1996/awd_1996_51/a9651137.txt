Abstract    :
                 At Harrisburg Area Community College, as in many community colleges, students
              majoring in business and social sciences are required to take at most two
              courses in mathematics or science disciplines.  Often these students elect to
              take college algebra which neither prepares them for a data oriented
              environment in the workplace nor exposes them to scientific methodology.  These
              students, who typically comprise one-half of the enrollment in college algebra
              in many colleges, need an interdisciplinary course which will provide them with
              the requisite skills and knowledge.  Further, such a course should provide a
              sound foundation for continued course work in mathematics, including applied
              calculus, and should address the learning styles of students historically
              underrepresented in the sciences and technology.  This project is developing a
              laboratory manual and textbook for an interdisciplinary course in quantitative
              and scientific literacy.  In this laboratory course, data collected by the
              students is being analyzed to determine both the scientific principles it
              illustrates and the properties of the function category for which the data is a
              numerical representation.  The project is providing an avenue to ensure that an
              increasing number of non-science majors will have the requisite skills and
              knowledge that will enable them to be competitive in their careers and
              successful in their lives.
