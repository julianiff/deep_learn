Abstract    :
              Florida International University (FIU) opened it's Southwest Miami campus in
              1972, and a second smaller campus, the North Campus, in 1977. The proposed
              project is being developed at the North Campus. We are establishing a computer
              laboratory for biology and chemistry students, to purchase an absorption
              spectrophotometer, specialized physiology equipment, and computer software to
              enhance and expand our current laboratory curriculum. The requested
              instrumentation allows us to conduct computerized experiments that will
              reinforce concepts such as kinetics, equilibrium, muscle, cardiac, nerve, and
              respiratory physiology, data analysis, and spectroscopy. The University has a
              diverse student population of approximately 28,000 with 66% of the students
              being minority. The North Campus, the site of this proposed project has the
              following distribution: 35% black, 28% Hispanic, and 26% white. Our departments
              are striving to stimulate early interest in science and encourage students to
              pursue scientific careers. Minority students, being in the majority at this
              university, would, therefore, be the beneficiaries of the proposed project. To
              teach and motivate students, it is imperative to provide them with current
              technology in the laboratory, a well balanced program of exciting experiments,
              and facilities to increase computer science literacy. It is our belief that
              implementation of this project will have a significant impact on both science
              and non-science majors with the potential expansion of innovative programs to
              other courses at the North and South campuses.
