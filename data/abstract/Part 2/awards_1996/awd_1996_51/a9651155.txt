Abstract    :
               This project provides funding to complete assembly of a working paleomagnetic
              laboratory, which furnishes students with a practical tool with which to
              examine fundamental geological problems. The lab provides an example of how
              real, vital, contemporary paleomagnetic and tectonic studies are done and
              allows undergraduate students to participate directly in such research.
              Undergraduate students are now introduced to a number of geophysical
              instruments and techniques in a freshman-level course. The instruments
              previously used are mainly for looking at small-scale features and local
              geologic problems. Paleomagnetism is one of the most important geophysical
              tools used for examining `big-picture` tectonic processes. The ability to do
              paleomagnetic analyses fills a need in this area and complements the previous
              geophysical program perfectly. In addition to use by introductory-level
              students, the lab can be used by upper-level geology majors as part of a
              well-supported, faculty-advised undergraduate science research program at the
              university. The equipment fits into continuing and proposed student research
              projects involving all faculty in the Geology Department as advisors. This
              innovative project affords students the unusual opportunity to be involved in a
              significant way in a young, rapidly developing field of geological research.
