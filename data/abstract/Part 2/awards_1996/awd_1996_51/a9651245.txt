Abstract    :
               This department is developing several new experiments in modern inductively
              coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) with an aim to motivating
              and inspiring curiosity in undergraduate students enrolled in two analytical
              service courses, quantitative and instrumental analysis for nonmajors and in
              the Integrated Laboratory program for chemistry majors. Students are learing
              first-hand how to prepare real samples by microwave digestion and the power of
              quantitative multi-elemental analysis for all important metals.   Since the
              advent of the first commercial ICP in 1975, the spectrometer has experienced a
              redesign and growth due to the use of composite materials instead of steel to
              make the spectrometer lighter, microcomputers to control the instrument and
              display results for multi-element analysis, and the use of a solid-state radio
              frequency generator to produce an Argon atom plasma that can reach 6,000 to
              9,000 degrees, a temperature sufficient to atomize and excite significant
              emission from almost any element.   There are several new generation
              spectrometers that are appropriate for use in the undergraduate teaching
              laboratory. Since fast sequential detection of 10 to 20 elements is possible,
              the technique is very well suited to the analysis of major, minor, and trace
              constituents found in real but complex environmental samples such as rocks and
              soil, foods and biologicals water, and air.
