Abstract    :
              This research is on design reuse and design process assessment.  Design reuse
              can  be in any part of the design cycle from initial phases (capture,
              processing, and  organization of design information), to final phases
              (matching, retrieval and  actual reuse of design information).  Mechanisms for
              supporting this activity are  being explored.  Attention is being paid to
              maximizing opportunities for reuse,  and assessing the impact on productivity
              of the reuse infrastructure.  Issues  being addressed include the
              characterization and representation of design objects  and design processes,
              automatic capture, indexing, retrieval and reuse of design  information.  The
              second investigation is developing a framework, including risk  assessment and
              planning tools, for design process assessment.  Metrics or  measuring
              management objectives and parameters of the design process are being 
              identified and characterized.  Results of the research are being tested and 
              validated in the design of large embedded systems.
