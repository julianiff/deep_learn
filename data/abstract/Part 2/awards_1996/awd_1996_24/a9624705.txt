Abstract    :
                    9624705  Mackin  This CAREER award is to study the connection between
              microscopic  and macroscopic mechanical properties.  The educational plan will 
              provide state-of-the-art programs to experimental and theoretical  mechanics
              for undergraduates as well as a connection with current  industrial problems. 
              The research emphasis will be given to  internal stress and strain
              distributions in composites and how  these change as damage accumulates.  The
              combined use of a non-  contact stress measurement technique known as SPATE and
              a newly  developed strain mapping method called DAiSleS will provide the 
              experimental data needed.  ***
