Abstract    :
              9624306  Gido  An integrated career development plan is proposed which  includes
              strong components in both research and education.  The major components of this
              plan are:  (1) to build a  research group of graduate students; (2) to assemble
               laboratory facilities and equipment; (3) to develop a  nationally and
              internationally recognized research program;  (4) to develop educational
              programs in graduate research  training as well as class work for graduate and 
              undergraduate students.  The research component of this  career development
              plan is interdisciplinary in the sense  that the system of study is natural or
              biological in origin,  but the aspects of this system that are of primary
              interest  fall into the realm of polymer science and materials  science.  It is
              proposed to investigate natural silk  spinning processes in silk worms and
              spiders so that these  incredibly efficient processes may to be used as models
              for  aqueous processing of genetically engineered biopolymers.  The techniques
              employed in this research will be mainly  electron microscopy, electron
              diffraction, energy dispersive  X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and electron energy
              loss image  filtering (Gatan Imaging Filter) on cryogenically prepared 
              samples.  Using these techniques, structure will be  corrolated with protein
              concentration in the aqueous silk  solution and the concentration of various
              salts which are  naturally present in the silk gland, and are thought to 
              influence chain conformation and phase behavior.  %%%  The educational
              component of this CAREER grant involves  outreach to high-school students and
              teachers, summer  programs, and field trips.  Results from this research will 
              be incorporated into classroom teaching in order to  illustrate general
              principles of polymer morphology,  crystallography, electron microscopy, etc. 
              The techniques  discussed in classes are general techniques of polymer  science
              and materials science.  ***
