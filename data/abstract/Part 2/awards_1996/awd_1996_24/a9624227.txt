Abstract    :
              9624227  Symans  This CAREER award is for establishing a Structural Dynamics 
              and Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory (SDEER) to be  used for both
              research and educational purposes.  The main  objectives are to further the
              development of passive, semi-  active and hybrid seismic response control
              systems with an  emphasis on the viability of hybrid control systems; to 
              expand the graduate student research program in earthquake  and wind
              engineering, and structural control as well as  exposing undergraduate students
              to these fields; and to  provide students in local public schools with the 
              opportunity of working together with natural hazards experts  and of learning
              about recent advances in these fields of  research.  ***
