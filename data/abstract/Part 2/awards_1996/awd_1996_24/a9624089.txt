Abstract    :
              While the Fourier transform is an indispensable tool in signal  processing and
              linear time-invariant (LTI) systems analysis, as  well as a staple of the
              electrical engineering education, many  natural and man-made processes are not
              time-invariant but rather  exhibit frequencies that change over time (e.g., FM
              communication  systems, the Doppler effect, speech and other biomedical
              signals).   The conventional short-time, or "quasi-stationary," extensions of 
              LTI concepts for studying such processes is often inadequate; for  example,
              depending upon the short-time analysis interval length  selected, dramatically
              different results can be obtained for the  same process, particularly when the
              signal contains both transients  and harmonics.  Accordingly, there is a need,
              both in engineering  practice and pedagogy, for the development of new methods
              for time-  varying (or nonstationary) signal processing.    This research
              involves the development and application of a general  method of nonstationary
              signal processing that surmounts the  limitations of methods based on the
              extension of LTI concepts to  time-varying situations.  The principle
              objectives of this research  are to: (1) develop new joint density-based
              methods for  nonstationary signal processing (e.g., scale); (2) apply these new
               methods to challenging, practical problems in biomedical signal  analysis and
              machine health monitoring (which fall under the  biotechnology and
              manufacturing Federal Strategic Areas); and, (3)  develop a general educational
              framework for nonstationary signal  processing based on the new methods, via
              new instructional  laboratory courses and research opportunities for college 
              undergraduate and graduate students.
