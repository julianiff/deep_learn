              Research Infrastructure:  System Support for a Hierarchy of Distributed
              Applications        This award provides infrastructure support for the
              researchers at the University of Texas at Austin to conduct the basic and
              experimental research necessary to address the problems that lie at the core of
              the emerging applications.  Specifically, the research proposes projects at
              three levels:  (1) core projects that will create an infrastructure for
              storing, accessing, and transporting large, heterogeneous information objects;
              (2) exploratory projects that will develop infrastructure which will facilitate
              the development of the core projects; and (3) realistic and ambitious
              applications from each of the following three  classes.  The first class is
              information retrieval applications, such as digital libraries.  These
              applications will support browsing of large-scale, distributed databases of
              multimedia information.  The second class of applications adds the requirement
              that the multimedia information be processed, not simply browsed.  Finally, the
              third class of applications adds the requirement of real-time interactivity.
