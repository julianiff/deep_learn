Abstract    :
                  9624364  Espinosa  A CAREER award will support research and education in the
               area of nanostructured ceramics and coatings.  In  particular, the wear and
              friction properties and the crack  initiation and blunting phenomena will be
              studied with  varying nano-crystalline microstructures.  Instrumentation 
              employed in the work include SEM, TEM and AFM.  Also  measured will be the
              emanating elastic waves, resolved  interferometrically with nanosecond
              resolution.  The  education plan includes mini-design projects, outreach to 
              high schools, and the use of team work and of open ended  problems.  ***
