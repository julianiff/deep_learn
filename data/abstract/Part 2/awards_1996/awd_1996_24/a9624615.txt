Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9624615    The proposed research focuses on the microphysics and
              flow of viscous multiphase fluids under conditions where the dispersed-phase
              volume fraction is moderately high (up to 50% and drop deformation is
              significant).  This project is an attempt to work towards a theory that
              directly relates to the rheology, drop size distribution, and spatial
              correlations between drops in a concentrated emulsion to a micro-physical
              description.     The goal of the proposed education plan is to promote
              creativity and interest in science and technology.  The educational plan is
              designed to provide an enriching, accessible environment for graduate and
              undergraduate research; fully integrate research and educational activities;
              enhance general scientific and technical literacy; and promote a wider
              involvement of women and people of color in science and technology.
