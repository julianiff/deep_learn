              $73,706    Title: Conference on State Strategies for Improving Teacher
              Preparation and Certification Consistent with Science Education Standards    A
              national conference is being held to focus attention of state education leaders
              on the implications of the recently released National Research Council (NRC)
              Science Education Standards and other national and state standards for K-12
              science content for the preparation of science teachers. Three important
              factors inform the preparation of   science teachers: 1) state policies;  2)
              teacher preparation programs designed by schools of education; and 3)
              undergraduate science curricula. Leaders from each of these areas will be
              speakers and/or panelists in several plenary sessions. Conference participants
              will be state education and science leaders who will attend as teams to
              facilitate: 1) discussion of the need for improving science teacher preparation
              in light of the new standards; 2) consideration of various models and
              approaches toward improvement; and 3) initiation of intra-state strategies for
              co-ordinated reform of policies and programs of science teacher education.
