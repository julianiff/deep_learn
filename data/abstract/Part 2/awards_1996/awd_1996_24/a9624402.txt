Abstract    :
              9624402  Shi   Most existing quality control techniques are off-line, i.e., they
              depend on the occurrence of defects that are removed or reworked to improve the
              outgoing quality level.  To improve quality during the manufacturing process
              involves emphasizing defect prevention rather than defect removal, on-target
              production with minimum variance rather than within tolerance, and continuous
              improvement rather than acceptable quality.  To achieve these goals, this
              research develops statistical process control algorithms for multivariate,
              correlated processes that are then integrated with on-line automatic process
              control algorithms.  The central ideas are to develop engineering models and
              anticipate fault patterns from product/process knowledge, to apply advanced
              statistics to extract features/indices of the process characteristics based on
              in-process sensoring, to identify the inherent relationship between the
              patterns from the engineering model and the indices obtained from the
              statistics, and to use this knowledge in automatic diagnosis, predictive
              maintenance and automatic compensation of process changes.  Automotive body
              manufacturing will be used as the application area of the research.  Two new
              courses are to be developed, and results from this effort will be incorporated
              into existing quality control courses.   Manufacturing quality is a significant
              factor in global market competition, particularly in the automotive sector, a
              vital part of our industrial infrastructure.  The variability inherent in
              equipment status contributes substantially to poor quality and productivity. 
              This work provides the technical basis for integrating on-line sensor
              information with operational control, and it has the potential to lead to
              improved equipment maintenance strategies that result in significant
              improvements in both product yield and equipment availability.
