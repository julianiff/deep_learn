Abstract    :
              Wavelet based numerical techniques are becoming important in many areas of
              science and engineering because they provide powerful analytic and algorithmic
              tools.  This project consists of a broadly based program of fundamental and
              applied research directed at advancing the state of the art of wavelet based
              numerical modeling, computation, and analysis tools.  This program is centered
              around three fundamental components: 1) Second generation wavelets; 2)
              hierarchical geometry descriptions; 3) construction of robust and scalable
              algorithms for the numerical solution of potential problems over 3D domain. 
              This research will go hand in hand with educational initiatives which aim to
              move insights from research directly into the relevant practice of students and
              external engineers and researchers.
