Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9624841    The goal of this research is to develop methods of
              generating silica-based ceramics in the form of porous bulk gels or as thin
              membrane films that have well-defined porous morphologies and pore chemistries.
              This work develops sol-gel routes to the synthesis of  hybrid organic/inorganic
              materials that can be converted to porous ceramics by the total or partial
              removal of the organic component of the hybrid materials through pyrolysis or
              solvent extraction.  Hybrid materials incorporate organic constituents either
              as molecularly well-dispersed solid solutes in the silica- ceramic network or
              as phase-segregated mesoscopic or macroscopic domains  are  formed and used as
              precursors to microporous ceramics or to mesoporous and macroporous ceramics,
              respectively.  Methods that selectively remove non-covalently bonded organic
              polymers from hybrid the materials and leave covalently bonded organic ligands
              on the porous silica networks are also developed.  These molecular templating
              approaches  are used to generate well-defined porous films with several
              specific goals:    polymerizable organic ligands (e.g., through free radical,
              ionic, or elimination mechanisms) are incorporated as molecular, templates for
              the generation of porous thin films that exhibit high degrees of  pore
              connectivity and orientation;    metal-chelating organic templates are
              incorporated, together with particular metals or metal ions, in the synthesis
              of hybrid thin films that are used to form porous ceramic membranes that
              exhibit high thermal stability, selective transport characteristics, and/or
              catalytic activity;    organic ligands exhibiting specific molecular
              recognition properties are incorporated into hybrid materials such that, after
              a porous thin film is formed from them, the organic ligands are localized
              preferentially on the surface of the porous network and hence can be used in
              the development of  porous matrices for chemical sensing applications.    
              Education developments include the revision an d improvement of specific
              aspects of the undergraduate and graduate chemical engineering curricula,
              including the establishment of an individualized instruction program for
              at-risk undergraduate students in chemical engineering the establishment of
              undergraduate research programs, especially for students from underrepresented
              ethnic groups, and the development of cross-disciplinary, industrial and
              federal (National Laboratory) collaborations that will expose students to
              aspects of the fields of chemistry, materials science, and microfabrication.  A
              major component of this educational plan is the implementation of an
              undergraduate research program whose main goal is the preparation of students
              from underrepresented groups for entry into graduate school.  This is done in
              cooperation  with several minority educational programs already in place  at
              the University of  New Mexico to enhance the access of minority students,
              especially members of  New Mexico's relatively large Hispanic and Native
              American communities, to research careers.
