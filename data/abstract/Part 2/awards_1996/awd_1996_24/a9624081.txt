Abstract    :
              9624081  Koseff    This  project will complete development and testing of
              laboratory  techniques  for  measuring  the  mixing  efficiency  of  breaking 
              interfacial (internal) waves, evaluate methods for estimating the  mass flux by
              measuring the flux directly and measuring the small-  scale structure of the
              turbulence, and study the evolution of the  turbulence  created by the breaking
              wave. The specific techniques  to  be  tested are a Digital Particle Tracking
              Velocimeter (DPTV)  and Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF), which yield data in a
              plane  rather  than  at a single point.  In addition, a novel  technique  for 
              generating  a breaking interfacial wave at a specified  (and  fixed) location
              will be attempted.  ***
