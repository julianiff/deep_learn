Abstract    :
              9624578  Durlach     This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project
              will focus concurrently on  developing   Visual Performance Instruments (VPIs)
              that enables the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing to perform in a medium   that serves
              as a visual analog of music, algorithms to process digitally sampled acoustic
              music and cause   VPIs to dance in accompaniment, and closely related science
              museum and commercial advertising displays   that utilize the same underlying
              hardware and software control environments. Phase II objectives include:   -The
              creation of a working prototype for a new VPI called the Tower of Triangles
              (TOT). TOT is made out   of mirrored triangular columns which function as
              linear torsional wave-mediums for small excitation energies   and chaotic
              systems for high-excitation energies, and may be "played" in real-time via a
              computer-mediated   user interface. -Adding the ability, in an existing
              performance artwork constructed out of iron dust in a   computer-controlled
              electromagnetic field, to dance automatically in response to music. The Phase
              II tasks   for implementing this system include the further development of an
              algorithm for extracting rhythmic   information from music in real-time, and
              software physics simulations whose initial conditions and   evolution
              parameters are modified in real-time by data extracted from the music. -The
              creation of a set of   computer-controlled turntables which function both as
              the drive mechanism for the first VPI mentioned above,   and collectively in
              their own right as a display device to animate, in sophisticated and complex
              ways, retail   point-of-purchase products and trade-show exhibit items.  
              Commercial applications of the science/artworks, VPIs and automatic music
              response control   software include: VPIs for the deaf, responsive dancing
              corporate logos for trade-show; retail store, and   nightclub environments;
              interactive science museum exhibits on wave mediums and chaotic systems;  
              kinetic signs for commercial use; an interactiv e option for coin-operated
              dancing artwork displays.
