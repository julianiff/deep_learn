Abstract    :
              This research focuses on the preparation of beta-lactones by the   development
              of Lewis acid mediated (2+2) cycloaddition chemistry and   tandem
              aldol/lactonization methodology.  New transformations of   beta-lactones
              including intramolecular allylsilane additions  and ferric   chloride mediated
              tandem debenzylation/transacylation will be probed.     The educational plan
              focuses on the development of a `transition` course   for first year graduate
              students, including minorities, minority outreach   to local high schools  and
              development of multimedia presentations for   use in the teaching of organic
              chemistry.  With this CAREER award, the   Synthetic Organic Program is
              supporting the research and educational   activities of Dr. Daniel Romo of the
              Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M   University.  Professor Romo will focus
              his research effort on the   asymmetric synthesis of a class of compounds known
              as beta-lactones.    These compounds serve as useful intermediates in organic
              synthesis, are   utilized as polymerization substrates and the basic structural
              unit   appears in a variety of physiologically active natural products.  The  
              educational plan will focus on the development of a `transition` course   for
              educationally disadvantaged first year graduate students and the   development
              of multimedia presentations related to organic chemistry
