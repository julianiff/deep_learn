Abstract    :
              A major obstacle to building robust systems that can read, summarize, and
              extract information from text is the need for large amounts of linguistic
              knowledge to handle the myriad syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic ambiguities
              that pervade virtually all aspects of text analysis. The objective of this
              research is to address this knowledge engineering bottleneck for natural
              language processing (NLP) systems. The work extends a general knowledge
              acquisition framework that allows an NLP system to bootstrap its own knowledge
              bases directly from text using standard inductive machine learning techniques
              in conjunction with an annotated corpus and robust sentence analysis.  In
              particular, the framework is being extended to handle additional problems in
              lexical and structural ambiguity resolution and is being evaluated using Penn
              Treebank data within the context of a larger NLP task. The work is of both
              theoretical and practical significance. First, the research will begin to
              determine the conditions under which machine learning techniques can be
              expected to offer a cost-effective approach to knowledge acquisition for NLP
              systems, especially in comparison to existing statistical techniques.  Second,
              the work will expand the current system into an integrated tool that uses
              machine learning techniques to guide NLP system development.
