Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to investigate the factors responsible for
              curvature in the phalanges  (the bones of the fingers and toes) in higher
              primates.  Primates that regularly grip branches  during movement appear to
              have more curved phalanges than those that walk on the ground.  As  such,
              finger bones have historically been very useful for interpreting behavior in
              fossil species,  including early human ancestors. However, we do not understand
              1) what aspects of the  mechanics of arboreal locomotion lead to phalangeal
              curvature and 2) how curvature develops.   This research will incorporate new
              analytical (i.e., finite element analysis) and data acquisition  (i.e.,
              pressure sensor pads, strain gauges on cadavers) techniques to test existing
              hypotheses  regarding phalangeal curvature by comparing how living arboreal and
              terrestrial primates use  their hands during locomotion.  Finally, the debate
              over how to interpret primitive morphology,  important to all paleontologists
              interested in the reconstruction of behavior from fossil  morphology, will be
              addressed by examining whether or not phalangeal curvature develops in 
              response to loads experienced during growth or whether curvature is merely
              `phylogenetic  baggage`.
