Abstract    :
              This proposal describes the design and implementation of VLSI vision systems for
               real-time dynamic tasks.  The two part career plan develops smart application 
              specific and general purpose visual computational sensors which may be used
              with  other intelligent systems to realize solutions to various robot vision
              and image  processing problems.  The three part research tasks are: (1) the
              development and  implementation of compact VLSI algorithms for image
              acquisition, edge detection  and motion detection; (2) applications of these
              algorithms to specific problems  such as image velocitometry, target tracking
              and rudimentary line-following auto-  navigation and (3) development of a
              general purpose VLSI computational sensor  which performs image acquisition,
              edge detection and 2D optical flow measurement  in a single compact system.   
              The goals of the educational component of this proposal include inclusion of
              VHDL  tools into introductory undergraduate digital design courses, and the
              development  of VLSI courses in imaging technology and mixed digital/analog
              signal processing  with fabrication and testing requirements.
