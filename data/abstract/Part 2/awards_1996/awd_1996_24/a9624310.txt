Abstract    :
              This project is building a high-performance distributed storage system using 
              communication switches and workstations.  Data to be stored will be distributed
               across the workstations and will be retrieved using the communication network 
              between the workstations.  Research issues to be addressed include
              identification  of hardware and software bottlenecks, limits to system scaling,
              scheduling of  multimedia I/O in a distributed system, and the implications of
              I/O on switch  architecture.  Education is a part of this project; plans
              include a graduate  course on I/O systems, an undergraduate laboratory in
              computer architecture, and  use of the machine developed during the research as
              a testbed for the graduate  course.
