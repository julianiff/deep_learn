Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to develop a set of Virtual Environment
              Readaptation Mechanisms (VERM) that facilitate user recovery to normative
              conditions after exposure to a virtual environment (VE).  While considerable
              work is being done to characterize motion sickness and identify the potential
              maladaptive aftereffects from human-virtual environments, there are currently
              few efforts focusing on the actions to be taken when post-exposure aftereffects
              are identified.  This research focuses on demonstrating the feasibility of
              developing provocative activities conducive to visual and visuomotor
              recalibration of known post-exposure disturbances, including ataxia (i.e.,
              postural instability), vestibulo-ocular reflex gain/phase changes, and degraded
              eye-hand coordination.  The approach consists of testing the effectiveness of
              three post-exposure readaptation mechanisms (locomotion activities, visual
              tracking tasks, and peg-in-hole tasks) to facilitate user readaptation under
              varying degrees of exposure duration, user initiated control, and visual scene
              complexity.  The results of this research will provide an understanding of
              post-exposure readaptation, as well as provide mechanisms that facilitate a
              timely recovery from VE exposure.  The VERM have possible application by VE
              system developers in specifying post-exposure protocols that verify when the
              aftereffects from VE exposure have dissipated, thereby maintaining the safety
              of users and minimizing the liability of developers.
