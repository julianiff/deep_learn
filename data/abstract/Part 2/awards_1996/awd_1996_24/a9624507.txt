Abstract    :
                    9624507  Soltis    This  dissertation project explores biological
              diversity  in  the  flowering plant genus Heuchera and its relatives.   The 
              primary goal is to explain how developmental patterns evolve  to create
              diversity.  DNA sequence variation will be used to  infer    evolutionary  
              relationships   in    this    group.  Traditionally,   floral  evolution  has  
              been   viewed   as  proceeding  from  superior ovaries towards inferior 
              ovaries  within   taxonomic  groups.   Preliminary  studies  of   the  Heuchera
               group  suggest other reasonable alternatives  that  should  be  tested.   To 
              explore the  avenues  along  which  inferior  ovaries  have  evolved I  will: 
              (1)  analyze  DNA  sequence  variation  to  reveal  relationships  within   the
               Heuchera  group; (2) characterize the floral development  of  crucial  taxa
              with electron and light microscopes;  and  (3)  map  developmental data onto
              the hypothesis of relationships  to   deduce  how  changes  in  development 
              create  specific  patterns  of  diversity.  Hence, this project  combines  the 
              strengths  of  analysis of DNA variation with  developmental  approaches to
              understand the generation of plant diversity.
