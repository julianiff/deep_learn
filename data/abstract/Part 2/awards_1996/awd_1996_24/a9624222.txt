Abstract    :
              The area of transaction processing in multilevel secure (MLS) database
              management systems (DBMSs) has substantially progressed in the past few years.
              Despite this activity, research in this area has been limited to traditional
              transaction concepts. Moreover, even for traditional transaction models,
              existing solutions for secure transaction processing are not completely
              satisfactory. This research (1) investigates the impact of multilevel security
              constraints on transaction processing in advanced database applications, and
              (2) examines whether the properties of the advanced transaction models, in
              particular nested transaction models, can be utilized to solve the secure
              concurrency control problems in traditional databases. It develops multilevel
              secure workflow and multilevel secure long duration transaction models, and the
              necessary extensions to the nested model required by MLS DBMSs. The results of
              this project enable incorporating multilevel security in advanced database
              applications such as process modeling, engineering design and long-running
              activities, and provide efficient secure transaction processing protocols for
              conventional database applications. Besides MLS databases, the results of this
              work are directly useful in other non-secure database environments such as
              hierarchically decomposed databases. The education plan includes development of
              three new courses at undergraduate and graduate level and student involvement
              in this research.
