              Paulius  This  Research  Planning  Grant will support  the  study  of  the 
              magnetic  flux  lines  in  high temperature  superconductors.   A  systematic 
              study is planned of the evolution of the first  order  melting  transition  in 
              very clean YBCO  single  crystals  as  a  function   of  controlled  point 
              disorder  created   by   proton  irradiation.  The dependence on the critical
              point, the  critical  regime, and the scaling exponents on the introduced
              disorder will  be  determined.   Insight  will be gained  into  the 
              fundamental  nature  of  the  vortex-defect  interactions,  a  parameter  also 
              important  for  technological  applications.  The  project  is  a 
              collaboration  between  Western Michigan University  and  Argonne  National
              Laboratory.  %%%  This  Research  Planning  Grant will support  the  study  of 
              the  magnetic flux lines in high temperature superconductors (HTS).  A 
              systematic  study is planned of the evolution of  the  flux  line  motion in
              very clean single crystals of the yttrium-barium-copper-  oxygen HTS as a
              function of controlled disorder created by proton  irradiation.   Increased 
              current flow  in  HTS  materials  in  a  magnetic  field  is  important for
              technological  application  of  these materials. The research will examine how
              the magnetic field  flux lines can be controlled in the HTS to reduce
              dissipation and  thus  increase  current  flow. The  project  is  a 
              collaboration  between   Western   Michigan  University  and  Argonne  
              National  Laboratory.  ***
