Abstract    :
              Graphical probabilistic models, such as Bayesian belief networks and influence
              diagrams, offer an attractive knowledge representation tool for reasoning in
              knowledge-based systems. As many practical systems tend to be large, the main
              problem faced by this approach is the complexity of probabilistic reasoning,
              shown to be worst-case NP-hard both for exact and approximate inference. Since
              the complexity proofs are for the worst case, it is important to study the
              properties of real models and subsequently to develop algorithms that will
              explore these properties. The purpose of this research is to develop efficient
              algorithms for approximate belief updating and decision making in very large
              probabilistic models. These algorithms explore asymmetries in joint probability
              distributions over model variables and search for the most likely states of the
              model. Very often a small set of states covers the bulk of the probability
              space. The project includes theoretical studies of methods for prediction of
              convergence speed and error bounds in search-based algorithms and empirical
              verification of the theoretical predictions on practical models. The algorithms
              developed in the course of the project are implemented and empirically
              evaluated in very large knowledge-based systems. As the complexity of
              probabilistic inference in belief networks is one of the main obstacles to wide
              application of probabilistic methods in knowledge-based systems, the
              theoretical results and the algorithms developed in this project can be
              expected to have a major impact on  the field.
