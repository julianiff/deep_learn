Abstract    :
               The aim of this project is to integrate research and education in advanced
              computation and artificial intelligence as applied to problems in molecular
              biology.  The underlying research theme is the relation of structure to
              function in complex systems.  The specific application focus is on enhanced
              protein structure prediction capability and its subsequent relation to
              function.  Structural models and empirical objective functions are extracted
              from the existing scientific databases, thereby capitalizing on an enormous
              scientific investment compiled over decades.  Structural predictions for novel
              protein sequences are made by aligning the sequence to the models so as to
              optimize the objective function.  A novel branch and bound algorithm permits
              the true global optimum alignment to be found even though the underlying search
              problem is NP-hard.  The education program creates a collaborative setting
              wherein computer scientists and biologists both can interact within an
              interdisciplinary research program.  Students from both disciplines can get
              hands-on experience ``learning by doing'' research on real and important
              problems.  The research will lead to improvements in our ability to predict
              protein structure and function from sequence, a crucial step toward design of
              novel pharmaceutical compounds, realizing the full potential of the human
              genome project, and understanding fundamental life processes.
