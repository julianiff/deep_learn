Abstract    :
              Abstract - Daoutidis - 9624725    A research program is planned to develop new
              analysis and controller design methods for nonlinear lumped parameter processes
              with input constraints and nonlinear distributed parameter processes.  The
              motivation is provided by the inherent presence of nonlinearities and spatial
              variations in chemical processes, the presence of manipulated input constraints
              in all practical control systems, and the lack of rigorous and practical
              methods that can deal effectively with these features.  The research will
              provide fundamental insight on the nature of the control problem for such
              systems and will develop concrete control algorithms with well-characterized
              stability, performance and robustness properties.  It will also study practical
              implementation issues and will apply the developed methods to representative
              chemical processes.      A series of educational activities is also planned,
              including improvement and development of undergraduate and graduate chemical
              engineering courses, the strengthening of the education and research
              infrastructure in control science and engineering at the University of
              Minnesota, the implementation of  collaborative and cross-disciplinary
              activities, the utilization of available resources for improving teaching
              effectiveness, and the development of an education initiative for colleges in
              the state of Minnesota.
