Abstract    :
              This  research  investigates  the  algorithmic  and  systems  issues  that 
              arise  in  on-line  and  off-line  distributed  manipulation  and organization
              tasks with cooperative  teams  of robots.  The objective is to develop a
              framework in which  it is easy to synthesize and reason about complex
              strategies  for  manipulating and organizing objects in  structured  and 
              unstructured environments, with teams of robots. Distributed  manipulation 
              systems  can be used for  tasks  that  require  reorganizing large objects in
              an environments,  for  example  waste   cleanup,   mine  sweeping,  and 
              furniture   moving.  Manipulation and organization can be formulated as
              placement  problems.   In  a  distributed  placement  problem  multiple  robots
              combine their skills cooperatively to move objects so  as  to  satisfy a
              desired global property of the environment  (for  example,  all  the movable
              objects  are  placed  in  a  designated  area.)  The research agenda is  to 
              develop  (1)  models for the information requirements of robot tasks;  (2) 
              algorithms  for  single robot manipulation  strategies  that  relay  on  given
              information requirements; (3) a  method  of  analyzing the structure and power
              of such algorithms; (4)  a  method  for  composing  reliable single  robot 
              manipulation  algorithms to obtain fault-tolerant cooperative manipulation 
              protocols  with  performance guarantees; (5)  a  method  for  establishing  
              trade-offs  between  sensing,  communication,  planning, and learning in
              distributed systems of robots; and  (6)  to implement, design, and test
              distributed manipulation  systems that use (1-5)
