Abstract    :
              9624488  Little  This is an award to support research to be conducted by this 
              investigator on factors that influence the quality of indoor air as  affected
              by building materials that are the potential source of  volatile organic
              compounds of pollutional significance.  The  investigator plans on developing
              fundamentally-based, mass-transfer  models for three generic classes of
              building materials and evaluate  procedures that can be used to evaluate the
              quality of the  parameters that can be used in those models.  Methods he plans
              to  use include screening measurements for sample selection,  formulation of
              mechanistic mass-transfer models, solutions  involving analytical and numerical
              methods, dynamic microbalance  experiments to determine diffusion and partition
              coefficients and  limited, large-scale chamber validation procedures for the
              models  devised during his research.    The research proposed is expected to
              provide a sound theoretical  foundation for the characterization of a wide
              range of building  materials as sources of volatile organic carbon compounds. 
              The  models that are an expected product of this research may prove to  be
              especially useful in reducing the number of costly and time-  consuming studies
              of materials conducted in test-chambers.  The  proposal leading to this award
              was submitted in response to NSF 95-  118, Faculty Early Career Development
              (CAREER) Program Guidelines  for Submission of Proposals.  As such, it not only
              addressed the  proposed research but related the investigator's career
              development  plan to the current state of knowledge in the field and of the 
              potential impact work supported under this award would result in  educational
              innovation and effective teaching in the investigator's  discipline.
