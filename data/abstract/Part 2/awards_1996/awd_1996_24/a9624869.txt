Abstract    :
              System designers have long assumed that memory cannot reliably store permanent 
              data because of memory's volatility and vulnerability to software corruption.  
              Memory's unreliability slows system performance by forcing some applications to
               write data through to disk and hurts reliability for forcing applications that
               care about performance to throw away 30 seconds of data on a crash. The
              primary  research goals of this CAREER plan are 1) to enable memory to reliably
              store  permanent data even in the presence of operating system or database
              errors; and  2) to measure how often software faults corrupt memory, both with
              and without  extra protection.    The primary education technique of this
              CAREER plan is relation instruction:   spending time and effort relating with
              students personally.  This plan suggests  several simple ways, such as group
              lunches, to do this effectively with large,  undergraduate classes; prior
              experience attests to how caring for students in a  personal manner motivates
              them to learn.
