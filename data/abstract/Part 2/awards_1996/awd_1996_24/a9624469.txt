Abstract    :
              9624469  Nakayama  This project involves the development of asymptotically valid
              simulation procedures for comparing the steady-state behavior of a small number
              (less than 20) of different systems.  Most steady-state comparison results for
              simulation assume that the underlying populations are normally distributed, and
              that observations from each population are independent and identically
              distributed.  These assumptions are violated in many practical situations,
              particularly in complex dynamic systems, where observations may be highly
              correlated and not normally distributed.  This research develops simultaneous
              confidence intervals for steady-state parameters of stochastic processes under
              a much weaker assumption, namely that the underlying stochastic process
              satisfies a functional central limit theorem.  The research focuses
              specifically on developing simultaneous confidence intervals for pairwise
              comparisons of means, contrasts, linear combinations of means, multiple
              comparisons with a control, and multiple comparisons with the best.  A software
              package will be developed that incorporates the new techniques developed.  The
              educational component entails the development of two new courses and simulation
              and modeling laboratory.             The development of efficient techniques
              for comparing simulated systems can have a great impact on a wide spectrum of
              industrial problems, including many large-scale problems in manufacturing and
              telecommunications where simulation may be the method of choice for analysis
              and decision-making.
