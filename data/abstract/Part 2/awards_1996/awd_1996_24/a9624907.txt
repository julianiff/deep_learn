Abstract    :
              CTS - 9624907  Russell Stewart  University of Utah    ABSTRACT    The project is
              on the fabrication of a microanalytical separation device incorporating the
              microtubular motor protein (kinesin) into nano-fabricated machines.  A
              prototype active chromatography device will be built to recognize, separate and
              detect specific DNA fragments on a single micromachined chip.  A
              fluorescent-labeled DNA fragment in solution will attach selectively to the
              motor protein and move along aligned microtubules in a microchannel to a
              detector.  The potential impact of the project is strong in bioseparations and
              chemical process monitoring.  If successful, it may be possible to mimic
              intracellular transport in fabricated machines.   The educational plan includes
              development of a new lecture and two laboratory courses on protein engineering
              and microfabrication.  Students will be trained to apply biological principles
              to conventional engineering problems.
