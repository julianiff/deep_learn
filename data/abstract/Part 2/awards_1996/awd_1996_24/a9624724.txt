Abstract    :
              CTS - 9624724  James Farrell  University of Arizona    ABSTRACT     The project
              deals with adsorption and transport phenomena in water-saturated microporous
              materials.  The mechanisms controlling the release of hydrophobic contaminants
              from aquifer sediments will be investigated using both model solids and
              acquifer sediments.  The research will focus on exploring the potential for
              capillary phase separation (CPS) of a hydrophobic solute within previously
              water-filled pores of molecular dimensions.  The solute-filled micropores may
              contribute to both adsorption/desorption hysteresis and the desorption
              resistant fraction.  Synthetic zeolites will be used as model sorbents to
              determine the effects of surface type, pore size, solute hydrophobicity and
              solute concentration.  Temperature programmed desorption experiments and NMR
              measurements are planned.  The research may lead to improved techniques for
              catalytic destruction of chemical pollutants from manufacturing processes and
              recovery of organic compounds from aqueous and high humidity vapor streams. 
              The educational plan includes both chemical and environmental engineering
              students.  It focuses on the use of case studies, relevant software packages
              and research experience for undergraduates.
