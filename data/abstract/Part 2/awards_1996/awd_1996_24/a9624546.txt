Abstract    :
              "STEP 2000"-Student Teacher Equity Program 2000:  The Comprehensive  Partnership
              between the East Side High School District, ESUHSD, and  San Jose State
              University, SJSU, will build the capacity of ESUHSD  to ensure that all of its
              students will take high level math and  science courses.  By the year 2000, all
              minority students,  graduating from high school will have completed the Math
              and  Science components of the California A-F college entrance  requirements at
              a level of 40%, which is at parity with the average  for Santa Clara County. 
              The project will continue the reform begun  by the Equity 2000 project and
              build upon The enlarged based of  students in the ESUHSD who are completing
              Algebra by the 9th Grade  and who are now eligible to take the higher level
              college  preparatory math and science courses.  New math and science  curricula
              adopted in some schools to accomplish reform will be  achieved at all schools,
              including the acquisition of new resources  and the necessary teacher training.
               Student supportive activities  in the form of Saturday Academies, Summer
              Institutes,  Career/Resource Centers, and Homework Assistance Centers will be 
              expanded during the project period to provide increased support for  math and
              science learning and to increase students' knowledge about  math, science,
              engineering and technology careers.    STEP 2000 will train all of the
              Districts 150 mathematics teachers  and all of the Districts 120 science
              teachers.  STEP 2000 will  affect all of the Districts' Grade 9-12 students,
              which will reach  24,000 during the Project period.  The underrepresented
              African  American, American Indian and Latino students, who presently 
              represent 46% of the students, will be especially affected.  At the  end of the
              project period, the number of them that will be eligible  to enter college and
              pursue math, science, engineering and  technology careers will have doubled
              from the start of the project.   STEP 2000 will complement and greatly help the
              other NSF funded  programs at  San Jose State University.  Specifically, the
              NSF  Alliance for Minority Participation program and the NSF  Collaboratives
              for Teacher Education Program will now have adequate  numbers of
              underrepresented math, science and engineering students  to recruit from.  ***
