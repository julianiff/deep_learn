Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9624785    Principal Investigator: Hsiu C. Han    Microwave
              Nondestructive Testing    Research in advanced microwave nondestructive testing
              for the inspection of civil engineering structures and modern composite
              materials will be performed.  The following aspects will be developed (1)
              application of theoretical models to properly characterize the scattering
              process in complex constructions consisting of both small-scale random
              inhomogeneities and large-scale deterministic structures; (2) development of an
              adaptive coherent microwave imaging algorithm to efficiently retrieve host
              medium properties, structural information and the locations and characteristics
              of any embedded defects; and (3) employment of the probability of detection
              concept to measure the effectiveness and reliability of microwave inspection
              under the prescribed conditions.  The significance of the proposed research is
              that it systematically integrates the knowledge in the forefront of microwave
              remote sensing and data processing research to construct a practical microwave
              imaging system.  The ultimate contributions that will be made by this program
              are to the upkeep of the aging national physical infrastructure as well as
              maintaining the leading position of U.S. manufacturers through improving their
              capability of quality assurance and process control.
