Abstract    :
              9624353  Gao   This CAREER award will investigate the research issues associated
              with "smart" bearings that embed and integrate transducers and microelectronics
              for data processing for diagnostics and predictive maintenance. The educational
              plan will produce globally oriented engineers that understand competitive
              pressures and have experienced cross-disciplinary teaming.  The research plan
              starts with quantifying bearing failure signatures, considers microelectronics
              and miniaturization of sensors and data processing into a prototype smart
              bearing, and bench scale and cooperative industrial experiments for
              optimization reliability.   The educational program has components of percolate
              outreach  through the University of Massachusetts-Amherst's K-12 Outreach
              Committee, and undergraduate course in mechatronic system design, and a
              graduate course on random data analysis and measurement.     The impact of this
              innovative research plan is that it is a key component of predictive
              maintenance, with implications for productivity, availability and most
              importantly, safety, of manufacturing machines and transportation systems.  
              The educational plan will enable the students to think critically and 
              communicate better in a team environment, making the nations human resources
              more competitive in a global environment.
