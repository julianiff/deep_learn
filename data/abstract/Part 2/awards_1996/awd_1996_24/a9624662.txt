              Hill    CISE Research  Infrastructure:  Infrastructure for Research in
              Collaboration Systems    This award is to support an  established, on-going
              program of research in distributed, collaborative, and multimedia systems.  The
               infrastructure will enable new basic research in system support for
              distributed collaboration.  Projects include:  Multimedia Networking,
              Hypermedia Systems, Application-Sharing, Collaborative  Virtual Environments,
              and Interoperable Collaborative Environments.    In addition, researchers at
              the  University of North Carolina will also work with a group of forensic
              pathologist, located at the Armed  Forces Institute of Pathology to build a
              digital library of `pattern-injuries` containing text,  images, audio/video
              sequences, charts, diagrams, and numerical data.  This testbed will enable
              groups  of forensic pathologist to consult a large repository of case data as
              well as consult with one another,  and jointly create new cases using
              conferencing and collaboration tools.
