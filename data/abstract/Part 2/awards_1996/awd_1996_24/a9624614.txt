Abstract    :
              9624614  Boothy  This is a CAREER Award.    The project will develop new repair
              techniques for historic  structures and will develop educational activities
              that will  cultivate a respect for historic buildings, structures, and civil 
              works, and an interest in their maintenance, repair, and  rehabilitation.  The
              teaching and research activities will adopt  a multidisciplinary perspective,
              including architectural history,  architectural history, architecture,
              civil/structural  engineering, and landscape architectural input.    The repair
              techniques to be studies involve the application of  new composite Fiber
              Reinforced Plastic (FRP) materials, and their  application to historic
              structures is considered a demanding test  bed for the more general use of FRP
              materials in the repair of  concrete, steel, and masonry structures.  The
              specific types of  structures to be included in the study are masonry and
              concrete  arch bridges, metal truss bridges, mid-20th century slab girder  and
              slab bridges, unreinforced load bearing masonry buildings,  and thin-shell
              reinforced concrete structures.   The specific  issue to be addressed for these
              building types include transverse  effects in filled arch bridges, load
              distribution and floor  system issues in truss bridges, the hazard of parapets
              and  cornices of URM buildings in Eastern locations in moderate  earthquakes,
              environmental damage to thin-shell concrete  structures.  The repair techniques
              to be studied include  replacement of critical elements with FRP materials,
              externally  bonded FRP sheet reinforcement, external unbonded FRP 
              reinforcement (banding), and chemical and mechanical prestressing  using FRP
              repair materials.  ***
