Abstract    :
              Brooks Pate of the University of Virginia has been awarded a CAREER grant   in
              the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to initiate studies of   laser
              control of molecular conformations for practical laser chemistry.    The goal
              of these investigations is to selectively populate a single   molecular
              conformational structure, resulting in an enhanced reaction   rate along the
              desired pathway.  In the two-laser experiment, molecules   are first excited to
              an energy region where the vibrational states   localized around the different
              conformational minima are coupled through   intramolecular vibrational energy
              redistribution (IVR).  Since the   vibrational frequencies depend on
              conformation, a second (resonant) laser   is then selected to stimulate
              emission to a lower state.  This lower   energy state lies below the onset
              energy for IVR, hence the final   structure is localized around the one desired
              conformation.   Little is   known about the conformations that a vibrationally
              excited molecule can   assume, yet reaction rates are strongly dependent on the
              conformational   structure.  These techniques will provide the first
              information of this   type and hence may lead to truly ground-breaking results.
                 The educational component of Prof. Pate's CAREER award will emphasize the  
              development of a physical chemistry course along the lines of a `research  
              training` course for those students interested in physical chemistry   careers,
              better utilization of computers in the curriculum, e.g.,   symbolic math
              software for problem manipulations, and incorporation of   modern research
              instrumentation in the laboratory courses.
