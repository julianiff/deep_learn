Abstract    :
              9624832  Prausnitz  This career development plan contains both research and 
              education activities.  The objective of the research is  to develop a
              mechanistic understanding of the effects  of ultrasound on molecular transport
              cross lipid  bilayer membranes, with particular regard to drug  delivery
              applications.  Flow cytometry, fluorescence  microscopy, and impedance
              microscopy will be used to  assess transport rates and test for the presence of
               various transport mechanisms.  This research will also  investigate the effect
              of ultrasound on increasing  molecular transport rates across skin.  The goal
              of the  educational plan is to broaden the community in which  students
              interact with other scientists in various  disciplines.  Some aspects of this
              include the use of  nontraditional problems in standard chemical  engineering
              courses, and the development of a new  bioengineering course which emphasizes
              cross-  disciplinary thinking and interaction with people  outside the
              university.  ***
