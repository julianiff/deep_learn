Abstract    :
                    9624980  Ostertag  This CAREER award project will combine education and
              research in  a new class of hybrid fiber reinforced composite cementitious 
              (HFRCC) materials in which both large and small fibers are used  to achieve
              high strength with better toughness.  The primary  research objective involves
              the study of crack initiation and  propagation in the HFRCC materials.  A
              secondary objective is to  optimize the properties at low reinforcement values.
               The  educational project involves modernizing the civil engineering  materials
              courses and related activities.  ***
