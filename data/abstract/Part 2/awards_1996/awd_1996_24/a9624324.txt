Abstract    :
              The vast majority of serious software design flaws are due  to incomplete,
              inconsistent, or obscure requirements  documents. It is in the very first
              stages of software  development, the requirements specification phase, that the
               fewest formal procedures exist to aid the analyst.  Techniques to capture,
              verify, and validate requirements  specifications for embedded systems are of
              demonstrable  importance. This project focuses on validation of  requirements
              specifications, specifically on executable  specifications.  An integrated
              framework is being  constructed for the development, analysis, and execution of
               high-level requirements specifications for embedded systems.  The framework is
              intended to support (1) execution and  simulation of embedded system
              requirements (hardware-in- the  loop simulation), and (2) requirements reuse
              and  requirements synthesis based on the structure and design of  the physical
              system. This environment will enable an  executable high-level requirements
              specification to interact  with: (1) models of the assumed behavior of the
              environment,  (2) software simulations of the environment, or (3) the  actual
              physical components in the environment.  The approach  taken is to extend an
              existing formal specification  language, RSML, with the capability to define
              system-level  inter-component communication in an embedded system.    The
              educational component of this CAREER project seeks to  increase industrial
              involvement in undergraduate and  graduate education through case studies and
              industrial  projects.  A remotely-accessible embedded systems laboratory  is
              being established, where students can gain realistic  hands-on experience with
              software development for real-time  systems.  ***
