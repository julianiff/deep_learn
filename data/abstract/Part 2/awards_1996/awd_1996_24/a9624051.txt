Abstract    :
                    9624051  Rausher          Natural  populations of the ivyleaf morning 
              glory  (Ipomoea  hederacea)  contain two distinct leaf shapes:   some  plants 
              possess  leaves  with  three  lobes,  while  others  possess  unlobed  leaves. 
              Leaf shape differences of  this  magnitude  have been shown to affect leaf
              temperature regulation (lobed  leaves  dissipate  heat  more  effectively), 
              and  herbivore  preference (some insects use leaf shape to recognize  edible 
              plants).   However,  an affect of leaf  shape  variation  on  plant 
              performance in the field has never been demonstrated.  Preliminary  results
              from field observations of  this  plant  species   suggest   that  lobed  and 
              unlobed   plants   are  specialized  for  different environmental  conditions. 
               The  study  will  use large scale field experiments  to  quantify  plant 
              performance as a function of leaf shape in a  natural  setting.  The study will
              also use greenhouse experiments  to  precisely  control  relevant 
              environmental  factors.   This  approach  allows  the determination of the 
              effect  of  leaf  shape  on  plant performance; may lead to an explanation  of 
              how  this  peculiar  polymorphism  is  maintained;  and  may  provide some
              insights into the importance of leaf shape  for  survival of plants in
              different environments.
