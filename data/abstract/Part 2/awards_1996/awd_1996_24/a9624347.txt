Abstract    :
              This Career award emphasizes the development of tools for  modeling
              identification, and response of mechanical systems  that include dynamical dry
              friction. Typical examples of  such systems include automobile squeak,
              rail-wheel squeal,  metal cutting processes, and many other manufacturing 
              applications. These phenomenon are inherently nonlinear and  their realistic
              modeling is crucial to understanding their  true dynamic behavior primarily
              applied to automotive  squeak. The approach involves wavelets to quantify the 
              frequency-time characteristics of the stick-slip and noise  events. Modern
              dimensionality theory incorporating state  space variables is used to
              accommodate the nonsmoothness of  stick-slip systems. Direct measurements of
              friction during  velocity reversals lead to establishing relationships  between
              the friction and the displacements, velocities,  accelerations, and time.
              Educational innovations include  developing a nonlinear oscillation course for
              off-campus  delivery, incorporating computers in courses, projecting 
              animations in lectures, and performing physical  demonstrations in the
              classroom to illustrate complex  dynamic phenomena.
