Abstract    :
              9624022  Filipowski   This research will formalize the inclusion of knowledge to
              the theory of approximate data for determination of algorithmic complexity. 
              Algorithms will be constructed that use knowledge about the feasibility,
              sparsity, and linearity of actual problem instances to decrease the data
              accuracy necessary to provide approximate solutions.  The techniques will be
              applied to numerical problems such as linear programs, convex quadratic
              programs, positive definite programs, and the linear complementary problem
              given only an approximation to the data of the actual problem instance.  The
              algorithms to be developed will be computationally efficient and will use
              nearly minimal data precision as measured by a condition number.  The research
              will further investigate the simultaneous use of condition measures and
              knowledge for problems specified with real exact data.   The results will be
              used to develop a unified theory of approximate data.  The investigator will
              develop a new graduate course on optimization and will continue the development
              of a seminar series in industrial engineering and operations research.  
              Traditional complexity theory based on the Turing machine model of computation
              has several limitations.  First, it assumes that problem data are rational and
              exact.  Second, it measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the bit
              length of the input, without consideration of the intrinsic difficulty of the
              particular problem instance.  Developing new measures of complexity that
              reflect the intrinsic difficulty of solving particular problem instances
              represents an important thrust in computational science.  The theoretical
              insights gained from this research have the potential to be translated into
              practical insights for mathematical programming and computer science.
