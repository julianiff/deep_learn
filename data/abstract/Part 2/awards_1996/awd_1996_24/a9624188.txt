Abstract    :
              9624188  Tsiotras  This CAREER project integrates the research and educational 
              aspects of dynamics and control of nonlinear systems.  Specifically, a special
              class of nonlinear systems, namely  those with rotating components is
              emphasized. A wide variety  of engineering systems such as aircrafts, robots,
              lathes,  milling machines, and underwater vehicles fall in this  category. An
              in depth analysis of the dynamics and  kinematics of the chosen system is
              carried out including  effective modeling of system equations, stabilization
              and  optimal control of each subsystem, synthesis of individual  controllers at
              the subsystem level into a complete  controller for the original system, and
              controller  implementation under actuator/sensor failure. The research  results
              are verified experimentally in the rotating  machinery and
              controls(ROMAC)laboratory. The educational  activities include introduction of
              new courses at the  undergraduate and graduate levels, participation in a 
              minority mentoring program, outreach activities at local  schools, and
              development of a dynamics and controls  laboratory for both research and
              teaching.***
