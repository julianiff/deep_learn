Abstract    :
              9624640  Jawahir   Cutting tools that provide the correct three dimensional
              (3-D) chip flow are a way to increase tool life and improve chip handling in
              machining.   Often chip breaking is achieved with a groove on the cutting edge,
              but a poorly designed groove can cause premature failure of the cutting edge. 
              Designing a 3-D edge geometry for controlling  the chip's contact area and flow
              direction requires a model of the mechanics of chip flow that includes groove
              geometry.  This means that fundamental understanding is needed to achieve the
              benefits of grooved 3-D tools.  This project will investigate 3-D chip flow in
              machining with complex grooved tools and the geometry changes caused by  more
              than one type of tool wear.  The research plan is to: document using high speed
              film, the mechanics of chip flow, establish a tool failure and grooved tool
              performance criterion for grooved tools with simultaneous multiple modes of
              wear,  and develop analytical approaches that can be used to design cutting
              edges for both chip control and tool life.     This research will improve the
              understanding of chip formation and tool wear, by extending the theory from
              mechanics based on planar faces to 3-D grooved geometry.  With this knowledge,
              cutting tools can be designed without resorting to extensive and time consuming
              experiments.
