Abstract    :
                This  research addresses two related problems in the design and management  
              in integrated high-speed communication networks. The first problem is to  
              analyze and develop the tools required to support and operate hierarchical  
              source routing algorithms currently under consideration for private and  
              future public ATM networks. This approach to routing aims to simplify the  
              operation of large-scale networks by introducing hierarchical structure and  
              attempts to ensure Quality of Service (QoS), prior to transmitting   connection
              requests, via source routing. Using a combination of stochastic   modeling and
              optimization techniques the principle investigator will study   various
              approaches to estimating, and periodically advertising available   capacity, as
              well as to hierarchically aggregating state information. The   second problem
              to be investigated concerns the design of performance   oriented embedded
              (virtual) networks on an ATM backbone. For specific types   of services, such
              as interactive video, the PI will explore various   architectures and
              complementary management schemes which meet overall   performance requirements
              and maximize throughput/revenue. This work will be   extended to address,
              services requiring heterogeneous resource bundles such   as on-line services,
              distributed computing, and database applications   requiring consistent
              high-levels of performance and for which the use of a   dedicated virtual
              network is justified.
