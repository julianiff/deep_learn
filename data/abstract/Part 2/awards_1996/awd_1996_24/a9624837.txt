Abstract    :
              9624837  Alleyne   This CAREER award will investigate the research issues
              associated with control of fluid power actuator systems to take advantage of
              their favorable load to power ratios, while improving their linear-like
              behavior. The educational plan has two goals: developing a fluid power
              laboratory that integrates the research and learning experiences for
              undergraduate and graduate students, and a plan to increase underrepresented
              minorities in engineering.  The project will develop a standard set of advanced
              control algorithms for generic fluid power systems, they will be implemented
              using open architecture approaches on hydraulic machine tool drives.  The
              target manufacturing applications are high performance drilling and new
              parallel-link manipulator drives.   The fluid power laboratory development is
              strongly supported by industry, and will enhance the University of Illinois at
              Urbana-Champaign's control and manufacturing offerings.  In addition, the
              laboratory plays an important role in the plan to attract and provide
              opportunities for underrepresented minorities, both through existing
              organizations like the local Boys and Girls Club and establishing an
              association for African-American graduate students in science and engineering. 
               The impact of this innovative project will be technical developments that can
              be used to design faster, safer and higher performance manufacturing machines
              and systems.   The educational plan will produce engineers experienced in the
              advances and limitations of high performance fluid drive systems, and provide a
              more diverse and technically competitive workforce.
