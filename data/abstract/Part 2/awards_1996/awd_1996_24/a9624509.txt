Abstract    :
                      9624509  Singh  This project provides support for an official Chinese
              Earthquake  engineering delegation to visit several U.S. research institutions 
              during the summer of 1996.  The delegation is made of members from  the Chinese
              Ministry of Construction and the Earthquake Resistant  Office, Yunnan Province
              where many damaging earthquakes have  occurred in recent years.    This project
              is an important international cooperative research  activity which has been
              recognized as a cost-effective means of  advancing knowledge base and obtain
              important data in the  scientific field of earthquake engineering research. 
              Such efforts  are effective because they utilize the complementary strengths of
               two countries to collect relevant data, disseminate information and  carry out
              research of mutual interest with joint human and material  resources.    This
              activity is a part of US-PRC Earthquake Protocol for  Cooperative Earthquake
              Studies, Annex III program which is jointly  administered by ENG/NSF and
              Ministry of Construction, China.  ***
