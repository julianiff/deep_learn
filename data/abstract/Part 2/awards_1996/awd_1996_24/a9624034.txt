Abstract    :
              Real-time analysis of large-scale data sets is becoming increasingly important
              in a variety of relativity new fields, including computational oceanography,
              geotechnics (earthquake engineering), metal forming (car and aerospace
              industry), elasticity (analysis of plates and beams), casting, aeroelasticity,
              impact analysis (crash simulation), and biomedical engineering (protheses and
              artificial teeth).  This project will develop techniques and prototype software
              systems for the representation and visualization of two-and three-dimensional,
              time-varying scientific data sets (including scalar, vector, and tensor fields)
              resulting from computational field simulations or physical measurements. The
              research issues being addressed are data reduction, multiresolution methods,
              spline representations, and visualization techniques or multiresolution
              representations based on triangular and tetrahedral grids.  This research will
              impact the design of next-generation scientific visualization systems
              supporting real-time rendering of large-scale time varying data sets
              represented on triangulated domains
