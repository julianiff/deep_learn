Abstract    :
              9624013  John-Alder   Inbreeding can cause developmental problems, increase
              susceptibility to parasites and promote the frequency of genetic disorders,
              limiting the capacity of individuals to make use of different environments and
              survive sudden environmental changes.  Because of the potentially negative
              effects of inbreeding, it is thought to be instinctively avoided by many
              wildlife species. The research funded by this award will test whether
              inbreeding is differentially avoided in four mammalian species having different
              social structures and dispersal patterns.   Disruption of normal dispersal
              patterns through habitat fragmentation creates small, isolated populations in
              which animals are unable to leave their natal ranges.  Findings from this
              research will address whether habitat fragmentation increases the frequency of
              inbreeding  for mammalian species with particular dispersal modes or kin
              avoidance behaviors.  These results can be used to inform reserve managers and
              wildlife biologists on species-specific behavioral attributes that exacerbate
              the negative effects of  habitat destruction and fragmentation.
