Abstract    :
              The research component of this program has two major thrusts: 1) an
              investigation  of the mathematical and computational aspects of the multiframe,
              bilinear image-  recovery problem; and 2) the development and application of
              solutions for  problems in the areas of high-resolution transmission electron
              microscopy, and  ground- and space-based astronomy.  Theoretical advances in
              this program are  providing a unified approach to many imaging problems in
              which intensity data are  recorded, including those for which satisfactory
              solutions have not been  previously discovered.  Collaborations with materials
              scientists on problems such  as the study of atomic scale processes in solid
              batteries are providing exciting  applications for which new methods developed
              in this program are being used to  enhance the resolving and
              information-gathering powers of electron microscopes.    Through the teaching
              component, an educational program is being established with  emphasis on 1) the
              development of a multidisciplinary laboratory in which faculty  and students
              from many departments jointly explore problems in remote sensing and  imaging;
              2) the development of multidisciplinary courses in remote sensing and  imaging
              in which students from many departments are included, and the educations  goals
              for each student - ranging from theoretical foundations to specific 
              applications - are tailored to his or her individual needs; and 3) the use of a
               strong research-teaching exchange in which cutting-edge technology is used in
              the  classroom and laboratory as a tool to excite, motivate, and retain
              enthusiasm in  the students
