Abstract    :
              9624186  ASKEW  This project will support shipboard scientific support equipment
                 for the research vessel SEWARD JOHNSON operated by the Harbor  Branch
              Oceanographic Institution and dedicated to use in support of  ocean science
              research.      The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides
              funds  for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct  of
              ocean science research. This Program provides support for such  items as deck
              equipment including winch systems for the deployment  and retrieval of
              scientific instruments, navigational equipment  such as radars, gyroscopes and
              earth satellite receivers to pin  point the location of research sites,
              communication equipment  including radio transceivers and satellite
              transceivers for voice  and scientific data communications and other equipment
              such as  motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data 
              retrieval sites.    The Project Director, Tim Askew, is fully qualified to
              direct  this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the 
              acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.      This project will
              allow the institution to replace under rated  blocks in the winch wire handling
              system, acquire a portable  hydraulic power pack and install a video system for
              monitoring  science activities on deck.  ***
