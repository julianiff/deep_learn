Abstract    :
              The continued growth and expanded applications in engineering,  economics, and
              sciences have greatly increased the need for  advanced computational methods
              for solving some highly complex  nonlinear complementary problems and
              variational inequalities.  The proposed investigation will focus on several
              major aspects:  (a) foundational---convergence properties and posteriori error 
              analysis of new and existing solution methods, (b) numerical---  computer
              implementation and testing and software development of  new algorithms, and (c)
              practical---the efficient solution of  important classes of engineering and
              economics problems.  The  class of mathematical programs with equilibrium
              constraints will  also be investigated.  ***
