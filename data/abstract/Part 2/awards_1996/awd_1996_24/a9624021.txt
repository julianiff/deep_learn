Abstract    :
              9624021  Anlage    The objectives are: to understand the basic nature of the 
              superconductor (SC) proximity effect, use this understanding  to engineer
              qualitatively new SC materials, and study the  physics of cuprate Scs through
              their microwave surface  impedance (MSI). Both low-Tc and high-Tc SC materials,
              in  both thin-film and bulk form, will be prepared and  characterized. The MSI
              will be measured by two resonance  techniques developed by the group. The
              research should lead  to our deeper understanding  of low-Tc superconductivity,
               the symmetry of the ground-state wavefunction of cuprate  Scs,  the influence
              of fluctuations on the physical  properties of cuprates, and a clarification of
              the physical  properties of the rogue electron-doped cuprate SC, as well  as
              some novel applications of superconductors.    %%%    Superconductivity is one
              of the many intriguing phenomena  that have come to light as scientists have
              explored the  realm of very low temperatures.And one of the most  astonishing
              features has been the "proximity effect"  whereby a superconductor can
              sometimes induce  superconductivity in a nearby normal material. In this 
              program, we shall conduct experiments designed to deepen our  understanding of
              this effect and of superconductivity in  general, and to engineer qualitatively
              new superconducting  materials.  ***
