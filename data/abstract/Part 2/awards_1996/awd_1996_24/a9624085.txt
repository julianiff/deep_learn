Abstract    :
                9624085  Frangos  Almost all tissues are subject to physical and environmental
               forces.  These tissues, in response, adapt and remodel to  accommodate these
              forces.  Two prime examples are blood vessels  and bone.  The former respond to
              the fluid shear and pressure of  blood flow by adapting vessel diameter and
              undergoing wall  remodelling.  The latter responds to the stress, pressure and 
              interstitial fluid flow due to mechanical loading by adapting and  remodelling
              bone tissues.  Using cell culture techniques, the  Principal Investigator's
              (PI) research efforts have focussed on  understanding the nature and the
              specific mechanisms of tissue  response to physical forces.    Having laid down
              the foundation in terms of techniques and  understanding of the force-cell
              interactions, the I proposes to  engineer force bearing tissues such as bone
              and cartilage.  The  overall objective is to develop several types of
              scaffolding  materials (collagen, bioerodable polymers, and hydrogels) as the 
              structural framework for bone and cartilage induction to be used  as implants
              and grafts.  ***
