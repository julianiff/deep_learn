Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT  Goodson  9624696    This work was awarded under the CAREER program
              and includes objectives for both research and education. The research plan is
              to create a Nanoscale ThermoElectroManipulator which applies heat and measures
              temperature with a 50 nm tapered, metal-coated, optical fiber. The fiber tip 
              will be used to pick up and anneal groups of atoms, to induce highly-localize
              chemical reastions at surfaces and to form, cut, and solder nanostructures with
              extreme spatial resolution.    The educational plan is to sponsor a national
              competition for thermal design of MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS).  The
              competition would be announced on the World Wide Web, and electronic mail would
              be used to mentor design teams and submit design proposals. The MEMS designed
              by the five finalist teams  would be prototyped at the Stanford Nanofabrication
              Facility with joint industry/NSF support and the students invited to Stanford
              for a symposium.
