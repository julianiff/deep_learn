Abstract    :
                9624396    Huang    A Shared distributed Facility for Multimedia Signal
              Processing and Visualization with Applications to Human Computer Intelligent
              Interaction.    This Infrastructure award supports the acquisition of
              computational, networking, and human interface equipment for multimedia
              laboratory for the investigation of human centered information systems.  The
              facility will connect three institutes:  the Beckman  Institute for Advanced
              Science and Technology; the Coordinated Science Laboratory; and the Digital
              Computer Laboratory.    The research supported by this laboratory will include
              research in multimodal human computer interaction, multimodal imaging and
              visualization, multiresolution representation and processing, and multimedia
              storage, networking, and communication.
