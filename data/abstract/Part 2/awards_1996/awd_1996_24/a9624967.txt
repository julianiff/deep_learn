Abstract    :
              This project establishes an active research effort in microelectronic systems 
              architecture that enhances the undergraduate curriculum in Computer
              Engineering,  Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, and introduces
              students to new  computer architectures, new technology and microelectronic
              systems.  The ideas  developed will be incorporated into the microprocessor and
              computer architecture  curriculum along with new cooperative learning
              techniques.  The focus of the  research component is to devise and test
              Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP)  techniques and mechanisms.  Programmable
              Logic Devises, such as FPGAs, are used  to implement rapid system prototyping
              of custom computer designs and are also  used to implement custom components in
              reconfigurable architectures.  Engineers  and computer Science students are
              taught with highly participatory "active  learning" methods such as cooperative
              learning which stimulate student interest  and learning.  By introducing
              students to teamwork in the engineering classroom,  learning is enhanced,
              fruitful networking relationships are developed and  students are able to adapt
              easily into other team environments.  The rapid-  prototyping platform
              developed for this effort is used for several upper division  computer
              architecture and microprocessor courses and the cooperative learning  pedagogy
              serves a national model.
