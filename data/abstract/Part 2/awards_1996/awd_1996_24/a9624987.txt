Abstract    :
              This project will develop software architectures capable of supporting user
              applications requiring a heterogeneous set of parallel or distributed modules. 
              The major thrust is to develop a set of tools and techniques to support the
              generation of interfaces designed to link parallelized packages.  In order to
              establish a general methodology, it is necessary to develop a testbed that
              utilizes many of the types of packages that must be integrated.  The project
              will develop a testbed that will act as the substrate for a medical informatics
              project and a project in computational aerospace.  The distributed packages in
              this testbed will include parallel databases, computerized medical records,
              High Performance Fortran programs, statistical package, and programs developed
              with parallel C++ class libraries such as LAPACK ++ and CHAOS ++. The ultimate
              goal of this research is to develop a framework that provides efficient
              integration of heterogeneous, parallel/distributed program modules.
