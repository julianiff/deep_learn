Abstract    :
                    9624698  Zavaliangos  The objective of this CAREER development award are
              to study the  mechanics of densification and the development of residual 
              stresses in heterogeneous powder mixtures.  Emphasis will be  placed on the
              design and manufacture of functionally gradient  materials which constitute a
              new class of composites that allow  spatial optimization of properties because
              they are characterized  by a significant variation in composition across a
              composite.   Beyond instructional activities of course and laboratory 
              development and outreach activities, the educational plan  involves the
              development of interactive, media rich computer-  aided instruction modules for
              materials engineering courses.  In  addition, it is also intended to establish
              prototype paradigms of  experimental facilities that can be remotely controlled
              over a  computer network.  ***
