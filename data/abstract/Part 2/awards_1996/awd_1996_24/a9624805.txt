Abstract    :
              This research focuses on the synthesis of syringolides and syringolide  
              analogs,  compounds of a type known to trigger disease resistance in   plants. 
               These synthetic molecules will be used to isolate and   structurally
              characterize their receptor proteins.  The ultimate goal is   the molecular
              cloning of the resistance gene responsible for producing   the receptor
              protein.  The research has important potential for   developing new methods of
              crop protection.   The educational plan focuses   on undergraduate course
              development.  With this CAREER award, the   Synthetic Organic Program is
              supporting the research and educational   activities of Dr. John L. Wood of the
              Department of Chemistry at Yale   University.  Professor Wood will focus his
              research efforts on   understanding microbial-plant signal transduction as well
              as the   biochemical events leading to the hypersensitive response mechanism of
                plant defenses.  The work has important potential for the agricultural  
              industry.   Dr. Wood's  educational plan focuses on course development at   the
              undergraduate level.
