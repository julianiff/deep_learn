Abstract    :
              Future high speed networks will carry traffic from a variety of   applications,
              including distributed computing/database applications.   The primary motivation
              to use high speed networks for this application   class  is to achieve very low
              latencies, and more  importantly, to   obtain guarantees on the delay bounds at
              the application level.  This   project will investigate application level
              performance in high speed   networks for this application class.  The
              objectives of this research   are to (1) characterize traffic from this
              application class using   actual traces, (2) determine application-level QoS
              requirements for   this application class, (3) translate the end-to-end
              application-level   QoS requirements to network level per node QoS (for
              instance,   cell-level QoS for switching nodes in ATM networks), and (4) assess
              the   effectiveness of existing techniques (both at the network as well as  
              the  application level) to guarantee QoS requirements for this   application
              class.  Analytical and simulation techniques assisted by   measurements will be
              used in this research.  The significance of this   research will be its
              contributions to the fundamental understanding  of   the interaction between
              distributed computing/database applications and   high speed networking
              architectures and protocols.
