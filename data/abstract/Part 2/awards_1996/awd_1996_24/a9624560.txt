Abstract    :
                NOTE: This CAREER award is a companion project to the CAREER  award
              CCR-96-24439, ``Cryptography, Proof Checking and  Approximation'', University
              of California, San Diego.  This  project focuses on the new area of provable
              security.  Provable security is achieved for a problem, when one  provides (i)
              a definition of security for the problem, (ii)  a protocol, and (iii) a proof
              that the protocol meets its  definition, assuming, for example, the
              intractability of  factoring.   Instead of just producing triples (definition, 
              protocol, proof), the goal of the project is to utilize  reductions as a
              technique for making precise statements  about the security of concrete
              cryptographic schemes; for  example, ``if you can break authentication protocol
              P with  resources X, then you can break the Data Encryption Standard  with
              resources Y''.  In particular, applications of these  techniques have already
              lead to a treatment of asymmetric  encryption, message authentication, entity
              authentication,  and key distribution. Protocols designed employing practice 
              oriented provable security have resulted in protocols used  in products of IBM
              and Microsoft, and in a proposed  International Standard.  The Integrated
              Educational Plan of  this CAREER Grant includes developing (a) a new graduate 
              course in modern cryptography; (b) undergraduate security  projects which are
              difficult, open-ended, and design  oriented; (c) course and course materials
              for a new  undergraduate course in graphs, games and coloring.***
