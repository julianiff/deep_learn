Abstract    :
              9624798  Farmer  The CAREER award treats ultra-thin oxides on silicon and
              ultra-thin wafer bonding.  The former is for the scaling of the CMOS technology
              in silicon-based microelectronics, while ultra-thin wafer bonding is applicable
              to Silicon on Insulator (SOI) technology.  Ultra-thin oxides less than 3.4 nm
              and nitrided oxides will be investigated during the program.  The educational
              program concentrates on a computer-assisted laboratory.  ***
