Abstract    :
              9624927  Hampikian    Combustion chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a novel 
              approach to chemical vapor deposition.  Because CVD is  carried out in an open
              atmosphere, it has the potential to  be a new cost-effective coating process. 
              In this CAREER  program coatings of alumina are applied to prototype nickel- 
              base alloys to assess improvements in oxidation imparted to  the alloys by the
              CVD coatings.  Several key issues related  to reactive element effects are
              examined through use of CVD  applied coatings containing various concentrations
              of  reactive element dopants.  The effectiveness of reactive  element additions
              in suppressing cationic diffusion in  alumina scales is addressed through study
              of doped and  undoped alumina scales and subsequent characterization.  The 
              mechanism of such suppression is explored for a critical  concentration effect
              to ascertain the validity of the  segregant/defect pair postulate.  The
              mechanism of  degradation of the uncoated and coated alloys to high 
              temperature corrosion is explored with the goal of adding  significantly to the
              current knowledge base in this area.  %%%  Work of this type is vital for
              optimum design of coating  systems for parts experiencing aggressive
              environments.  For  example thin ceramic coatings can be used to improve the 
              corrosion resistance of bulk materials. The coatings act as  barriers between
              the environment and the substrate to  protect the substrate from erosion and
              gaseous and liquid  corrodants.  ***
