Abstract    :
              9624151  Matthew  This career development plan contains both research and 
              education activities.  The objective of the research is  the development of
              cell-seeded tubular prostheses that  will allow for the proliferation of smooth
              muscle in  its matrix and endothelial cells on its luminal  surface.  The
              primary chemical constituent of the  matrix will be glycosamioglycans, a
              biologically active  polysaccharide from connective tissues.  The research 
              will focus on characterizing the physicochemical  properties of the prostheses,
              evaluation of the growth  of vascular cells on these materials, and the 
              development of a simulated in vitro system for overall  evaluation.  The goal
              of the education plan is to  engage in curriculum development with an emphasis
              on  Problem-Based Learning and Group Learning, and to  foster minority student
              recruitment, retention and  mentoring activities.  ***
