Abstract    :
              Many software developers view evaluation as a burden both because  it  
              currently   takes  significant  effort  and   because   most  programmers  are
              not trained in it.  In the context of  the  PI's  area  of  expertise 
              (planning and  agent  design  in  Artificial  Intelligence), the purpose of
              this project is to address two gaps  in  current  methodology and pedagogy: the
              dearth  of  evaluation  methods  for AI software agents and the absence of
              empirical  and  evaluation  methods  in the undergraduate and  graduate 
              computer  science  curricula.  Towards these ends, the  research  component 
              creates  new methods for evaluation that support AI agent  design  and
              development in the context of two agent projects: a simulated  robot  and  an 
              information gathering  agent  for  the  WWW.  The  teaching   component 
              integrates  evaluation  methods  into   the  undergraduate and graduate CS
              curriculum by incorporating modules  into  existing courses where possible and
              designing  new  courses  where  necessary.  Each  component  exploits  existing
               and   new  research   projects  for  exploring  issues  of   evaluation   in 
              motivating design. The expected results are not only new software  evaluation 
              methods, documented examples of  their  use  and  two  thoroughly  evaluated
              software agents, but also experienced,  new  practitioners.
