Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics program of the Chemistry Division   of
              NSF, and within the Faculty Early Career Development Program,    Professor
              Miguel A. Garcia-Garibay of the University of California, Los   Angeles, will
              study photochemistry in  crystals of  organic compounds.    The study will
              emphasize the selection of crystalline precursors which   upon photolysis will
              produce biradicals within the crystals.  Since the   biradicals will
              consequently be in highly constrained environments,   unusual
              structure-reactivity behavior is expected.  The magnetic   properties of the
              biradicals will also be determined.  A new Physical   Organic Chemistry course
              will be developed, as will a new approach to   General Chemistry for Life
              Sciences majors.  Dr. Garcia-Garibay will   place a special emphasis on
              mentoring of students from underrepresented   groups.   Crystals of organic
              compounds involve close packing of the molecules, and   the consequent
              constraints on the structures of products and intermediate   species in solid
              state reactions are profound.  This work will define   some of the chemical and
              physical properties of an important class of   reactive intermediates when
              placed under such constraints.  Courses will   be developed at both
              undergraduate and graduate levels.
