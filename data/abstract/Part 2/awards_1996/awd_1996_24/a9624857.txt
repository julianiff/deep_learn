Abstract    :
              This research focuses on operating system support for  collaborative information
              systems, in which multiple users or  programs cooperate to maintain a shared
              information resource on a  computer network.  The central focus is development
              and  evaluation of a "network virtual store", a virtual memory based  storage
              repository for networked clusters of 64-bit computers.  The network virtual
              store represents a convergence of distributed  file systems, software-based
              distributed shared memory systems,  and "object-oriented database systems"
              supporting transactional  access to persistent data structures.  The goal of
              the project is  to explore new storage management approaches for group
              computer-  aided design systems, scalable database servers, and other 
              applications that require high-performance access to recoverable  state in a
              distributed environment.  ***
