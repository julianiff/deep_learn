Abstract    :
               This research will formulate and develop a method for controlling the   traffic
              carried on a broadband communication network, specifically for the   case of
              carrying diverse real traffic sources with difficult to model and   analyze
              queueing properties; inter-source correlation; slowly varying   statistical
              properties; diverse heterogeneous source types; mis-specified   traffic
              descriptors; and inadvertent network traffic shaping. The focus is   the case
              when the traffic sources are given quality of service guarantees   and the goal
              is to maximize utilization of network resources. The method is   based on
              statistical classification techniques that use historical data as   to what
              were acceptable combinations of carried traffic and what were not.   Problems
              addressed include efficient representation and storage of   historical data;
              choice and modification strategy of classifier model;   noise on the data;
              confidence intervals on decisions; directed and   undirected exploration of the
              decision space; filtering out uninformative   data; and implementations. The
              effectiveness and advantages of the methods   developed will be experimentally
              tested against alternative methods on   simple models and real traffic traces
              such as ethernet data; variable rate   video; and ISDN traffic.
