              Infrastructure:  Network of Symmetric Multiprocessors : An Infrastructure for
              Research in Scalable Systems and Applications    This award provides support
              for a research infrastructure based on commodity PC-based Symmetric
              MultiProcessor (SMP) servers, high-speed networks, and customized network
              interfaces and communication software.  It will enable new research activities,
              extension of on-going research activities and will generate synergy among the
              several research efforts.  Key research areas which will be enabled by the
              infrastructure include virtual memory-mapped communication, efficient shared
              virtual memory, scalable virtual storage servers, efficient message passing,
              and performance measurement.  Application areas include scalable DNA computing
              simulations, parallel fluid dynamics, particle-based computation in a
              homogeneous medium and projects in parallel computational biology.  The
              infrastructure consists primarily of stock hardware, but in quantity large
              enough to investigate the viability of  building a large-scale scalable system.
                 The infrastructure will be constructed in three phases:  an initial phase, 
              a building phase, and a large-scale experimental phase.  In the initial phase,
              four PC-based SMP servers will be connected together with a custom-designed
              network.  In the building phase, 16 PC based SMP servers will be connected with
              a high speed commercial network and a Myricom/Princeton customized network.  In
              the experimental phase, 32 next generation PC-based SMP servers will be
              connected with a commercially available high-speed network and a
              Myricom/Princeton customized network.  All research projects will utilize the
              infrastructure to conduct large-scale experiments.
