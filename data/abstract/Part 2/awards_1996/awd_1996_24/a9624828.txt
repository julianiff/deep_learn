              Algorithms and  Biology: Theory and Practice  Combinatorial optimization
              problems arise in fields as diverse as  transportation,communication,
              large-scale computing, and biology.  This project focuses on three fundamental
              areas in combinatorial  optimization:(1) Scheduling, including good
              average-case  scheduling algorithms and algorithms for scheduling a network of 
              processors;(2) Flows and Cuts, including multicommodity flows,  minimum cuts,
              and shortest paths;(3) Computational Biology,  including problems that arise as
              part of the human genome  project, algorithms for DNA folding, and techniques
              for studying  evolution.  The Integrated Educational Plan of this CAREER Grant 
              includes curriculum reform, new course development, training of  teachers in
              new technologies, and outreach to high school  students. ***
