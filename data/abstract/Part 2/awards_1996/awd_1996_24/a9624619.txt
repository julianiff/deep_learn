Abstract    :
              9624619  Edwards  This career development plan contains both research and 
              education activities.  The objective of the research is  to develop an analysis
              of cell volume response to  osmotic stress conditions that include
              unsteady-state  intracellular transport, dependence of intracellular  transport
              phenomena on the gel structure of  cytoskeletal proteins and on the occlusions
              posed by  internal organelles, and absorption of solutes onto  external and
              internal membranes and partitioning into  organelles.  The primary anticipated
              application is  cryopreservation of human, animal and plant cells.  The 
              rationale is that increased understanding will improve  the predictive
              capability and design of appropriate  freeze-thaw cycles.  The goal of the
              educational plan  is incorporate knowledge of mass transfer fundamentals, 
              including new applications, into undergraduate and  graduate curricula.  Also,
              a textbook on Mass Transport  in Biology is planned.  ***
