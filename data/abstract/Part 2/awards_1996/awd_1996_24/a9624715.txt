              Abstract  ATM-9624715  Dunbar, Robert  William Marsh Rice University  Title:
              Lake Titicaca: Toward a Detailed Record of the Quaternary  Climate in
              Subtropical South America    This award supports a pilot study that has two
              operational  objectives: (1.) to undertake a high-resolution survey of Lake 
              Titicaca, Peru/Bolivia and (2.) to recover several short (3 meters)  piston
              cores from the large, deep basin of the lake.  These cores  are expected to
              span the entire Holocene and latest Pleistocene.   Analysis of the cores will
              be limited to a preliminary survey,  including determination of accumulation
              rates using radiocarbon  dating, sedimentology, bulk chemistry, stable isotopic
               geochemistry, and composition of diatoms and pollen.  This study  will
              determine the best sites for location of the long cores and  begin to address
              the many important questions about the climatic  record of subtropical South
              America during the Holocene and latest  Pleistocene.  Lake Titicaca is one of
              the most important climatic  archives in South America.  The recovery and
              preliminary analysis  of the proposed cores will provide unique,
              well-calibrated  paleoclimatic records of wide-spread significance.
