Abstract    :
              9624245  Butler       A balanced career development program is proposed which 
              integrates a research plan focusing on the design and development  of an
              incipient failure detection and predictive maintenance system  and an education
              plan which utilizes that research in enhancing  undergraduate and graduate
              courses.       This research proposes the design and development of  analytical
              signal processing techniques, new heuristic and  probabilistic techniques, and
              an expert system method which will  perform incipient fault detection and
              predictive maintenance for  distribution systems.  This system will reduce
              unscheduled down-  time, increase quality up-time, and decrease overall
              maintenance  cots.       The proposed education plan includes the enhancement
              of the  undergraduate power systems courses to expose and train students to 
              use new power system technologies.  These revitalized courses will  be made
              available to universities with small power programs through  distance learning
              technology.      ***
