Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9624433    The objective of this research is the design of novel
              heterogeneous catalysts for emission control  applications.  In particular, the
              research  focuses on two applications:  the removal of NOx via its selective
              catalytic reduction with hydrocarbons (hydrocarbon-SCR) under excess oxygen
              ("lean") conditions; and the simultaneous removal of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and
              chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The proposed research uses
              kinetic and in-situ spectroscopic characterization techniques. The different
              reaction pathways involved in the overall reaction networks, the reactive
              intermediates, and the active surface sites are identified. These findings are
              correlated with the structural properties of existing catalysts and used to
              provide important leads for the design and synthesis of the next generation of
              catalytic systems.  This research could lead to a novel, hydrothermally stable
              hydrocarbon-SCR catalyst that would find commercial use in both mobile and
              stationary emission control applications, while a new bifunctional catalyst for
              the simultaneous removal of NOx and clilorinated VOCs would find an immediate
              use in controlling emissions from municipal and medical waste-incineration
              units and a long-term use in controlling emissions from the chlorochemical and
              the coating industries.     The proposed educational plan includes the
              development of new courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels and
              the continuous involvement of  undergraduate and graduate students in research.
              The new courses include a freshman-level course in chemical manufacturing, a
              senior-level elective course in environmental engineering, and a graduate-level
              course in heterogeneous catalysis.
