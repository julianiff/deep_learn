Abstract    :
              Image Compression reduces the number of bits required to represent an image, and
               thereby allows image and video information to be stored more efficiently, or
              to  be transmitted much faster from one place to another.  Some compression
              methods  degrade the quality of the image.  This research involves designing
              compression  methods which examine the content of an image in order to control
              or eliminate  the degradation for some portions of the image.  The intent is to
              increase the  visual quality or scientific utility of the images.  This work
              also involves the  design of multiresolution methods for region-based image and
              video compression,  and the development of novel methods for quality evaluation
              for such codes.    Dividing an image into regions can allow a compression
              algorithm to employ  different encoding strategies in different portions of the
              image, and can allow  some regions to be represented at higher quality or finer
              resolution than others.   Methods for segmentation, bit allocation, and code
              selection at different levels  of resolution will be examined in the course of
              our investigations.    The main objects of the education plan are to promote
              interactive and hands-on  learning, to be highly accessible and supportive to
              students whom I advise, and  to facilitate interdisciplinary as well as
              academic/industrial discourse.
