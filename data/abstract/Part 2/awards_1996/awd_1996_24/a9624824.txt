Abstract    :
              Flach  9624824  This award provides funding for a project in Arithmetic
              Algebraic  Geometry. The project centers around the conjectures about  special 
              values of L-functions attached to varieties over number  fields. More
              specifically, the investigator will work on the  Tamagawa number  conjecture
              for the adjoint of a modular form,  and on the study of  Galois module
              theoretic invariants whose  definition is motivated by the conjectures on
              special values of  L-functions.  This project falls into the general area of
              Arithmetic Algebraic   Geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas
              of  mathematics: Number Theory and Geometry.  This combination has  proved
              extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems  that withstood
              generations. Among its many consequences are new  error correcting codes.  Such
              codes are essential for both modern  computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
