Abstract    :
              Dr. Wornat's proposed research on pyrolysis mechanisms and kinetics of
              polycyclic aromatic compounds is aimed towards determining the pathways and
              kinetics of reactions involved in the formation, transformation, and
              destruction of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) and soot from coal and other
              fuels.  Experiments will be conducted using a flow reactor with samples being
              withdrawn at specific reaction times and analyzed using HPLC/UV.  From
              measurements of intermediates and products, reaction mechanisms will be
              developed and kinetic parameters derived.  Connections will be made to soot
              formation.  This work is distinct from the usual acetylene route used for soot
              formation from lower hydrocarbons.  The educational plan is innovative and
              includes several attractive features including student research, guest
              lecturers and visits to power plants.
