Abstract    :
              9624189  Wilkening    Unequivocally endorsed by the Chancellors and the UC
              Regents, CAMP  has become the standard bearer for ensuring diversity among our 
              student populations systemwide.  CAMP has come far in the first  four years,
              laying the groundwork for exiting new possibilities  that extend the program in
              various ways to further develop the  pipeline to baccalaureate degrees and
              beyond.  NSF funding phase II  will allow extending the project by
              strengthening the quality and  quantity of B.S. degree recipients among
              underrepresented students;  expanding curricular reforms; integrating and
              institutionalizing  programmatic components; linking with teacher preparation
              through  K-12 collaboration; continuing to disseminate successful efforts,  and
              extending the use of evaluation to decision-making.  Phase II  offers a set of
              experiences that engage the entire educational  continuum and also extend to
              the development of minority teachers  in science, mathematics, engineering and
              technology fields.   Through summer and academic year programs that have seen 
              unprecedented success, and through new bold plans that address the  transition
              to graduate and professional school, Phase II promises  to advance the
              faculty-driven momentum that the Alliance has  achieved.  New collaborations
              and synergy with related initiatives  will fuel our endeavors.  Similarly,
              linkages with business and  industry will be strengthened through the Statewide
              advancement  officer who will be dedicated to developing corporate partnerships
               at each UC campus.
