Abstract    :
                The purpose of this research is to analyze the dynamics of  competition in the
              hard disk industry using a structural model of  differentiated demand for the
              industry and detailed product-level  data on price, quantity, and product
              characteristics.  The model  will be used to estimate cross price elasticities
              between  products and markups over marginal cost.  The marginal cost  estimates
              will then be used to observe the rate of decline of  monopoly markups.  This
              will allow the investigators to see  whether declining prices due to increased
              productivity is due to  learning by doing or reduced markups due to
              competition.  The  cross price elasticities will be used to analyze
              "spillovers":  the effects on each firm's productivity of R&D activity by other
               firms.  By putting all these estimates together the investigators  can compare
              the social rate of return with the private rate of  return to R&D.
