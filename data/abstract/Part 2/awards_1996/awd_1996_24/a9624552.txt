Abstract    :
                This project focuses on two lines of research: (1) program  correctness and
              (2) the problem of learning deterministic  and probabilistic finite
              automata:(1) Because the simplest  of programs can be full of elusive errors,
              the study of  program checkers, self-testing programs and self correcting 
              programs, was introduced, in order to permit the use of a  program without
              trusting that it works correctly. In this  area, the goal of this project is to
              develop a core of  algorithmic techniques for writing fast and simple checkers,
               self-correctors, and self-testers;(2) The goal in the area  of learning
              deterministic and probabilistic finite automata  is to study the applications
              of automata learning algorithms  to on-line page replacement strategies,
              reinforcement  learning, game theory, part-of-speech tagging, phoneme 
              modeling, and parsing. The Integrated Educational Plan of  this CAREER Grant
              includes designing new projects to  facilitate undergraduate and graduate
              student involvement in  the research process and mentoring undergraduates. ***
