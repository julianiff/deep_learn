Abstract    :
              The main objectives of the proposed research are: (1) to develop  an integrated
              multimedia computing environment that supports  efficient mechanisms for
              storage, transmission, and presentation  of information in multiple forms
              (e.g., video, audio, images,  text, and numeric data); and (2) to utilize it to
              develop  innovative methods for delivering education.  To achieve these 
              objectives, the proposed research promises to develop an  end-to-end
              architecture consisting of: (i) a multimedia file  system that supports
              efficient means for storage and retrieval of  multi-resolution multimedia
              objects, (ii) network algorithms and  protocols for efficient transmission of
              multimedia objects over  networks, and (iii) processor scheduling mechanisms as
              well as  transport and higher layer protocols that support efficient 
              processing and streaming of data at the end-station. The  end-to-end system
              architecture thus created will form the basis  for: (a) creating a digital
              repository of educational material  containing video-lectures, notes,
              presentation slides, simulation  packages, animation, images, etc., on several
              inter-disciplinary  topics, and (b) providing efficient methods for organizing
              and  browsing through the information space. In addition to being a  realistic
              testbed for evaluating the end-to-end system  architecture, this digital
              library prototype will provide an  excellent environment for evaluating the
              effectiveness of various  methods of distance learning and self-paced
              education. The  findings of this research will significantly impact the design
              of  large-scale digital libraries and distance learning tools of the  future.
