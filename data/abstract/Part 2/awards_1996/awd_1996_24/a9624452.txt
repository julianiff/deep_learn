Abstract    :
              9624452  Thouless  An objective of this CAREER development award is to 
              establish a research program in structural adhesives.  The  proposed research
              will combine experimental and theoretical  aspects in a micro-mechanical
              approach to understanding the  mechanical behavior of adhesive joints.  The
              research will  provide a fundamental and unified understanding of the  strength
              of adhesive joints and it will also address the  critical need in the
              automotive industry to understand how  to optimize the energy-absorbing
              capacity of adhesively  bonded structures.  The educational plan involves 
              establishing multi-disciplinary courses in which physics  based aspects of
              materials science are combined with  traditional mechanics aspects for the
              undergraduate and  graduate curriculum.  ***
