Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT  Xu  9624890    This work was awarded under the CAREER program and
              includes objectives for both research and education. The research plan
              addresses the mechanisms of laser-material interactions and the possibilities
              for novel laser-assisted materials processing techniques.   In-situ diagnostic
              techniques to determine the properties of  laser-induced plasmas will be
              developed and a "particulate-free" pulsed laser deposition technique will be
              explored.  In addition, in situ diagnostics for measuring the temperature
              field, fluid flow, and melt front propagation during laser micromachining are
              planned. A combined numerical and experimental approach will be applied to
              understanding the phase change process and a novel "clean" micromachining
              process will be developed.    The educational plan includes the development of
              an instructional "Laser-Assisted Microscale Materials Processing Laboratory"
              for undergraduates. In addition, two undergraduate/graduate courses entitled
              "Laser processing in Manufacturing," and "Photothermal Non-Destructive
              Evaluation" will be developed.
