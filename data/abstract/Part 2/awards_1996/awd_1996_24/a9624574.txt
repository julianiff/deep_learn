Abstract    :
              9624574  Howell   This award provides resources to support research and teaching
              in the area of compliant mechanisms.  Compliant mechanisms gain some or all of
              their motion from the deflection of flexible members rather than from
              traditional joints only.  In the past, compliant mechanisms have been limited
              to simple applications due to difficulties associated with their analysis. 
              This research focuses on the development of methodologies to simplify compliant
              mechanism analysis and design.  The pseudo-rigid-body model concept will be
              developed for analysis of these non-linear systems, and will be used to unify
              compliant mechanism and rigid-body mechanism theories.  New and recent research
              results will be integrated into the curriculum in the form of a new course on
              compliant mechanisms for graduate and upper-level undergraduate students.  
              Compliant-mechanism theory offers a new way of solving many mechanical-motion
              problems.  Advantages of compliant mechanisms include decreased manufacturing
              and assembly time and decreased cost due to reductions in part count.  Other
              advantages include reductions in weight, vibration, noise, and wear.    
              Compliant mechanisms also simplify the design of microelectromechanical systems
              (MEMS), and allow them to be constructed using methods similar to those used to
              fabricate integrated circuits.  The research will enable the design of
              mechanisms that were previously considered unlikely, if not impossible,
              applications of compliant mechanisms.
