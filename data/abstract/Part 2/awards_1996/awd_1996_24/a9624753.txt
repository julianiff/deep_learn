Abstract    :
              9624753  Himpsel    This  project  aims  at finding new, universal  methods  for
               obtaining  self-assembled  one- and  zero-dimensional  metal  structures by
              decorating step edges at vicinal surfaces. The  surface energetics and the
              conditions for smooth, row-by-row  growth will be determined by coupling STM
              with sophisticated  growth  and spectroscopy techniques. Particular emphasis 
              is  placed  on  magnetic  nanostructures  for  use  as  magnetic  sensors and
              storage media.  %%%  The  goal  of  this  project  is the  design  of 
              artificial  materials that consist of ultrafine wires, about one hundred  times
               narrower  than  those produced  with  current  micro-  structure  fabrication 
              techniques. New  patterning  methods  will   be   developed   where   atoms  
              arrange   themselves  automatically at a stepped crystal surface. Applications 
              of  the new materials in magnetic data storage will be pursued.  ***
