Abstract    :
              This is a Faculty Early Career project, the research part of which deals   with
              titanium dioxide as a photooxidation catalyst for environmental   remediation
              by degradation.  The project will study the organic   intermediate buildup and
              decay during titanium dioxide catalyzed   photooxidation.  Many groups have
              studied titanium dioxide for the   present purposes but the usual approach is
              to investigate the initial   step and to assume that subsequent intermediates
              are rapidly mineralized.   Use of titanium dioxide with dilute solutions of
              toxics (as in the real   world one must) will leave intermediates largely to
              decay spontaneously   and the biological consequences will only be known when
              the nature and   concentrations of the intermediates are known.  The project
              will be one   of only a few, and the only led by a synthetic chemist, using
              this   approach.  The  educational work centers on making students more active 
               participants in the learning process.  Dr. Jenks will develop   undergraduate
              laboratory experiments along the lines of this research.  In this project the
              intermediates in one possible future technology,   catalyzed light-induced
              decomposition of organic environmental   contaminants, will be studied. The
              project will provide information from   which the possibility of introduction
              of biohazards will be studied. The   project will also emphasize
              student-centered learning and the integration   of this research into
              undergraduate laboratory teaching.
