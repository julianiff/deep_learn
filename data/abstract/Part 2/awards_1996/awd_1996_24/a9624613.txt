Abstract    :
              CTS - 9624613  Michael Tsapatsis  U of Massachusetts Amherst    ABSTRACT    The
              proposal research deals with the preparation of mesoporous molecular sieve
              films using a surfactant liquid crystalline template.  The existence of liquid
              crystalline mesostructure allows for a processing strategy similar to polymeric
              liquid crystals.  An induced macroscopic ordering of the mesostructure may
              result in macroscopic perfection of the inorganic structure.  Flow and magnetic
              fields will be used to induce ordering and obtain oriented mesoporous molecular
              sieve membranes and films.  Spectroscopic and microscopic characterization of
              the film structure will be performed and related to the processing conditions. 
              The potential impact to the project is strong in separations, catalysis,
              sensors, and advanced electronic, magnetic and optical materials.  The
              educational plan includes new undergraduate and graduate courses in materials
              characterization and mathematical modeling.  Undergraduates will be involved in
              research and trained to formulate and solve open-ended problems.
