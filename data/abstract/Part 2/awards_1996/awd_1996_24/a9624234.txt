Abstract    :
              9624234 Leeb The proposed research seeks to develop diagnostic, load use, and
              power quality monitoring technologies for electrical loads in commercial and
              industrial settings by continuing development of a Nonintrusive Load Monitor
              (NILM) incorporating an advanced transient event detector.  The NLM identifies
              and determines the operating schedule of the major electrical loads in a
              building from measurements made solely at the electrical utility  service
              entry. Career funding would also contribute to the development of a novel
              interdisciplinary "capstone" course be offerred to seniors in the Department of
              Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and also Mechanical Engineering. 
              This class is an exciting experiment to introduce industry and
              cross-disciplinary particpation into the late undergraduate, early graduate
              part of a student's experience in my department.  Each student in the class
              will be challenged with a term-length project derived from an actual problem in
              industry. ***
