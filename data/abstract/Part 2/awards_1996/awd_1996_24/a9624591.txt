Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT  Thole  9624591    This work was awarded under the CAREER program and
              includes objectives for both research and education. The research plan
              addresses the effects of free-stream turbulence on turbine blade heat transfer.
               Experimental study of a up-scaled version of a first row stator vane will
              yield information on the flow field and the heat transport.  Optimization of
              film cooling of the turbine blade, using both numerical simulation and
              experimental measurements will then follow.    The educational plan includes
              recruiting women engineering students, retaining women engineering students and
              restructuring courses in the thermal sciences area.  Seminars at rural high
              schools in southern Illinois will be aimed at attracting women and at informing
              guidance counselors of opportunities in engineering. In addition, an optional
              all-women engineering design course will be offered at the University of
              Wisconsin-Madison.
