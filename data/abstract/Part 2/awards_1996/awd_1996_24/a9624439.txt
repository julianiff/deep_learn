Abstract    :
                NOTE: This CAREER award is a companion project to the CAREER  award
              CCR-96-24560, ``Practice-Oriented Provable Security'',  University of
              California, Davis. This project focuses on the  areas of (1) provable security
              and probabilistic proof  checking with orientation towards developing
              practical, but  proven secure protocols and (2) probabilistic proof checking 
              (PCP) with application to the derivation of  nonapproximability results for
              NP-hard optimization  problems. The problems examined cannot be solved by some 
              kind of ``technology transfer'' from theory to practice;  rather the
              theoretical principles have to be used to develop  new models and solve new
              problems.  Applications of the  techniques of practice-oriented provable
              security are  applied to such problems as: session key distribution, use  of
              block cyphers to provably achieve basic cryptographic  goals, and balancing
              between individual privacy and law  enforcement, via key escrow or other means.
               In the area of  PCP, the problems studied include determining tight results 
              for the approximability of Max Clique, and improved results  for Max SNP
              problem. The Integrated Educational Plan of this  CAREER grant includes
              developing: (a) new undergraduate and  graduate courses in principles of sound
              protocol design,  with joint university/industrial training projects; and (b) 
              an undergraduate algorithm design course in which proof  checking tehniques for
              determining good approximate  solutions are taught and applied to NP-hard
              optimization  problems.***
