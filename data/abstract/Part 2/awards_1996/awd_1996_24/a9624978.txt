Abstract    :
              9624978  Pruitt  The  broad objective of this CAREER development award is  to 
              develop  a  strong, well-integrated research and educational  program  focused 
              at the understanding of structure-property  relationships in advanced
              engineering materials with special  emphasis on advanced polymers.   The focus
              will be on ultra-  high   molecular   weight  polyethelene,  because   of   its
               importance in biological applications, and the evolution  of  its structure
              and mechanical integrity as a result of  post-  sterilization  aging.   The
              educational plan will  integrate  the  research  into curriculum development
              and undergraduate  research opportunities leading to a strong multidisciplinary
               curriculum  in the area of mechanical behavior  of  advanced  materials, 
              including the implementation of new  courses  in  polymer engineering and
              biomaterials.  ***
