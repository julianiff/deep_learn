Abstract    :
              9624808  Lacks  This CAREER grant supports the work of a young assistant 
              professor at Tulane University, chemical engineering  department.  The PI has
              been trained in molecular simulation  methods as applied to a study of
              polymers.  The work  proposed here focuses on the vibrational properties of 
              polymeric glasses and their influence, on the one hand on  the dynamical
              relaxation in glasses and on the other, on the  thermodynamic properties.  The
              essential educational  component consists of a revision of the chemical
              engineering  curriculum to include more moleculap theory and computer 
              simulation.  %%%  This is a CAREER grant to a young assistant professor at 
              Tulane University chemical engineering department.  The  grant contains a
              research component consisting of a computer  simulation study of the
              vibrational properties of polymeric  glasses (plastics). In the educational
              component, the PI is  proposing revision of the chemical engineering curriculum
              to  include more molecular theory and also computer simulation.  ***
