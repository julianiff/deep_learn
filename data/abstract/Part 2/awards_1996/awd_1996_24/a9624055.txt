              Dutta    The   project   employs  synchrotron  radiation  to   study   the 
              intermolecular  correlations within very thin liquid films. These  are a
              relatively easily controlled and geometrically well defined  class   of  
              `confined'   liquids,  whose   properties   can   be  significantly different
              from those of bulk liquids. Systems to be  studied  include thin films of
              concentrated metal salt solutions,  spreading  films of viscous liquids, and
              wetting films  on  solid  substrates.  The structures within and normal to the 
              film  plane  are  to  be  probed as functions of film thickness,  temperature, 
              solute  concentration, and applied potential. The  investigations  are  of 
              fundamental  interest and are relevant  to  applications  involving not only
              lubrication, wetting, and  spreading, but also  to  other  confined systems
              such as liquids in  droplets,  porous  minerals, capillaries, and biological
              cells.  %%%     This  project  investigates  the  structural  arrangement   of 
              molecules within very thin liquid films. Synchrotron radiation is  used  to
              measure the structure as it can be quite different  from  bulk  liquids. The
              properties of liquids change when they are  in  the  form  of  very thin films
              or in other `confined' geometries.  The  investigation is not only of basic
              interest but  is  related  wetting and spreading processes (such as occur in
              painting or oil  spills),   and  related  industrial  processes.  The 
              information  obtained  is  likely  to lead to a better  understanding  of  the 
              properties of other confined systems such as droplets in a cloud,  oil   in 
              porous  rocks,  and  fluids  in  biological  cells  and  capillaries.  ***
