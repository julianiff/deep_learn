Abstract    :
              The emerging field of resource-bounded reasoning is concerned with the
              development, composition, and meta-level control of flexible  computational
              methods that allow small quantities of resources, such  as time, memory, or
              information, to be traded for gains in the value  of computed results.  A
              better understanding of these techniques is  essential for the construction of
              useful intelligent systems for  automated planning, diagnosis, decision making,
              and control. There are two primary components to this research project.  One is
              the development of resource-bounded techniques for automated  information
              gathering from a network of heterogeneous, dynamic information sources.  The
              approach extends the classical theory of information value by formalizing the
              effect of such factors as information reliability, retrieval costs, real-time
              operation,  and uncertainty.  A second and closely related activity improves 
              current planning technology by constructing planning systems that  can operate
              in real-time under uncertainty and under variable  computational constraints.
