Abstract    :
              The  research plan is to develop shape representations for  image  and  video 
              ulderstanding.  The approach is to encode  shape  and  motion  in  terms  of
              nonrigid deformations from prototypical  or  extremal  views.  This research
              builds on previous work in  modal  matching,   an  orthogonal  shape 
              decomposition  for   matching,  describing,  and comparing shapes despite
              sensor  variations  and  nonrigid   deformations.   Shape  and  motion 
              coefficients   are  expressed in terms of the eigenmodes of deformable shape 
              models.  The  project extends this modal matching framework in  four  main 
              directions;    comparison    metrics,    prototype-based    shape 
              representations,  including intensity information,  and  encoding  motion and
              shape.  Primary system evaluation is on synthetic data  sets  specifically
              designed to characterize algorithm limits with  respect  to noise and
              deformation.  System performance is  to  be  evaluated using a large database
              of images collected by  a  world  wide  web crawler.  Towards this end, a web
              robot is being built.  The educational plan addresses course development and
              teaching in  multimedia  computing,  active engagement  of  undergraduates  in 
              research,  and  outreach  for  recruiting  a  greater  number  of  students 
              from traditionally underrepresented groups in  computer  science.
