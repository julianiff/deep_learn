Abstract    :
              Seismic rehabilitation of existing buildings has been a significant area of
              research during the last decade. However, very little guidance exists for the
              evaluation of existing buildings and, other than case studies or qualitative
              descriptions, there are no specific recommendations for the design of
              retrofits.  To this end, the research under this program will focus on the
              seismic evaluation and retrofit existing buildings, in particular reinforced
              concrete frames.  The main objective of this research project is to evaluate
              current methodologies for the evaluation of existing reinforced concrete frames
              and to develop alternate procedures for the evaluation and design of retrofits.
               This objective will be accomplished by conducting analytical studies of
              selected reinforced concrete frame buildings representative of existing
              construction in regions of low-to-moderate and high seismic risk.  The results
              of the analysis will be compared with measured response when possible and will
              be correlated with current procedures for the evaluation of buildings.  Based
              on these results, modifications to existing procedures will be proposed and
              alternate methodologies will be developed.  The investigation will have a
              direct impact on the effort sponsored by the Federal Emergency Management
              Agency (FEMA) to prepare Guidelines for the Seismic Rehabilitation of Buildings
              (ATC-33).  The research undertaken will be combined with an education component
              which focus as on the development of a program in infrastructure rehabilitation
              cover issues broader than the seismic rehabilitation alone.  Also, a program on
              new materials for civil engineering applications being developed.  These
              programs will be implemented through research, development of new courses, and
              outreach and extracurricular activities involving the participation of both
              undergraduate and graduate students.  This is a FY 96 Career award.
