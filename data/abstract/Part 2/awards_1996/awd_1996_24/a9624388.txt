Abstract    :
              9624388      Scott         This project focuses on furthering the scope of
              morphology development of immiscible polymer blends during extrusion (or mixing
              using twin extruders).  Identification and qualitative analysis of the critical
              mechanisms of morphology development are particularly significant.  A numerical
              model will be developed for simulation of melting and morphology development. 
              The model will be used to predict the phase morphology during compounding which
              includes the fraction of each melted component, determine which phase is
              continuous, the phase domain size, and the evolution of material temperature
              along the screw.  The primary impact of this work will be establishment of a
              quantitative basis for the design of more effective compounding processes and
              equipment.  The information will be useful for scale-up, design of processes
              for difficult to mix formulations, maximization of throughput, and minimization
              of polymer degradation.   The success of this project will lead to improved
              design of twin screw processes and equipment and allow commercialization of
              materials that are difficult to produce economically because of mixing
              limitations.  This project also proposes and education plan as a follow-on to
              this research.  This plan will improve students' Team Project Skills at the
              undergraduate level and develop a Polymer Processing course that provides a
              thorough fundamental understanding of the technology in addition to computer
              simulation, design, and industrial aspects.
