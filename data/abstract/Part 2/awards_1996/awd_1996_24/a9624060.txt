Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9624060  Paul J. Marto         This proposal is to investigate
              enhanced film condensation on tubes.  A combination of hydrophilic and
              hydrophobic coatings will be used to selectively control drainage from the
              tube.  The tube surface will be coated with a very thin titanium layer,
              followed by a gold layer to which self-asqembled monolayers of organic
              molecules will chemisorb.  Successful augmentation using this passive technique
              could have important implications for the power generation, refrigeration, and
              desalination industries.
