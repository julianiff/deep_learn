Abstract    :
              9624254  Archer     This career development program combines course development
              and mentoring with fundamental studies of shear-induced slippage of polymeric
              fluids in simple geometry's.  The research focuses on the classic no-slip
              condition.  Recent studies indicate this condition may not be valid at
              sufficiently high shear stresses for polymer melts and solutions and even for
              some Newtonian fluids.   The research uses optical and spectroscopic methods to
              study spatial variations in polymer orientation in the bulk and close to
              confining walls.  The effects of chain length and polymer strand orientation
              close to bounding surfaces will be studied in entangled polymer solutions.  In
              polymer solutions and melts, the influence of inner-species  mixing and stress
              gradients on small molecule migration and slip will be determined.  Information
              of this type has application in polymer processing.   The educational component
              of this program includes further development of two new courses, Polymer
              Engineering and Polymer Dynamics.  These courses will be integrated into a new
              multi-disciplinary undergraduate polymer engineering program.  This is part of
              a strategy to make the chemical engineering program more responsive to changing
              industrial needs.  A special feature of the educational plan is a mentoring
              program whereby talented undergraduates are exposed to industrial research
              problems.  Specific plans are included for training promising underrepresented
              minority students in basic research methodology.  This plan includes efforts to
              improve graduation rates and post graduate enrollment rates for this group of
              students.
