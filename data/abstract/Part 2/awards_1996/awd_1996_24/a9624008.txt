Abstract    :
              This  research can be classified into two major themes, motivated by the 
              following key bottlenecks for wireless systems: the scarcity of radio 
              bandwidth, and the problem of interfacing inherently lossy wireless links  with
              high-speed wireline networks where loss occurs mainlv due to  congestion. The
              first research theme is concerned with enhancing the  capacity and performance
              of direct-sequence CDMA, which holds great promise  as a robust workhorse
              technology for future wireless systems. Since  multiple-access interference
              imposes a major limitation on CDMA performance  two broad methodologies are
              considered for alleviating its effects:  decentralized adaptive reception and
              centralized multi-user reception. The  goal is to further the theoretical
              development of both these methodologies  with a view to developing practical
              receiver structures. The issues  addressed include devising methods for making
              adaptive interference  suppression work over the severe time variations of a
              wireless  multiple-access channel, supporting multiple classes of traffic (and
              hence  multiple rates) using direct-sequence CDMA, inventing near optimal
              adaptive  nonlinear receivers, incorporating antenna diversity into
              interference  suppression schemes with reasonable complexity, and deriving
              receivers  based on multi-user detection and estimation principles for systems
              to  which adaptive methods do not apply.  The second research theme is the 
              development of a theory for designing interfaces that ensure compatibility 
              between wireless and wireline networks while minimizing the use of precious 
              wireless bandwidth. The problem formulations, while of broader interest,  are
              motivated by the fact that two wireline technologies with which a  wireless
              network must be compatible are the emerging ATM networks and  TCP/IP. The
              problems considered include the formulation of service  guarantees over a lossy
              wireless link and the design principles for  implementing them, optimization of
              wireless bandwidth for a broadcast or  multiple-access wireless channel by
              using transmission control based on the  channel state seen by each receiver,
              manipulation of the feedback  mechanisms used by TCP/IP flow control and ATM
              rate control by the wireless  interface to provide good end-to-end performance
              over a heterogeneous  network with both wireless and wireline links, and the
              design of a flow  control mechanism that does not suffer from the shortcomings
              of TCP/IP.
