Abstract    :
                  This proposal is to investigate energetic particle injections  (electrons 
              50keV,ions  100 keV) associated with geomagnetic storms  and substorms in an
              attempt to understand the change of the  magnetic and electric fields in the
              tail and inner magnetosphere  during these events.  Investigations will focus
              upon impulsive  injections associated with isolated substorms and the resulting
               drift echoes observed in the inner magnetosphere.  Drift echoes can  provide
              information about changes in the magnetic and electric  fields in both time and
              space, which can be utilized in models of  the fields that govern the particle
              motions.  Test particle tracing  techniques will be utilized and the simulation
              results will be  compared with observations.
