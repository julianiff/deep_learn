Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the uses of randomization, with  particular emphasis on
              graph algorithms.  In particular,  the problems to be ``tackled''(but not
              necessarily exactly  solved) by the PI's randomized graphical optimization 
              techniques include: (1) The maximum flow and minimum cut  problems can be
              solved exactly, with the major objective  being the design of faster, simpler
              and more practical  algorithms for arriving at a correct answer; (2) Graph 
              coloring and bisection, analysis of network reliability,  and construction of
              low-cost high-connectivity networks,  are extremely hard to solve exactly, with
              the major  objective being to find efficient algorithms that give  answers as
              close as possible to the elusive optimum.  Implementation and testing of the
              algorithmic solutions is  an integrated component of this project.  The
              Integrated  Educational Plan of this CAREER Grant includes the  teaching,
              improvement and development of theoretical  computer science courses,
              including: (1) Undergraduate  algorithms course; (2) Undergraduate discrete
              mathematics  course; (3) Graduate randomized algorithms course; (4) 
              Undergraduate information retrieval and text databases.
