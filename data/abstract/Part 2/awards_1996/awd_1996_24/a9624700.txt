Abstract    :
              Effective computer architecture requires a carefully selected set of workloads 
              that are representative of the target design's software environment.  However, 
              it is becoming increasingly difficult for computer architects to obtain
              workloads  that accurately characterize today's complex software systems.  The
              Architect's  Workload Suite (AWS) project seeks to address this problem by
              developing a  collection of commercial, public domain, and next-generation
              software systems  that architects can use as a source of representative
              workloads.  Using on-chip  performance counters and custom tools, each workload
              in the  AWS will be  accompanied by  Workload Characterization Worksheet that
              summarizes its  architectural requirements including memory-system,
              branch-prediction,  instruction-level parallelism, course-grained parallelism,
              and operating system  support.  Workload summaries will allow researchers to
              carefully screen the AWS  workloads, selecting a set that is appropriate for
              their work.  In addition to  the workload suite, this work is developing
              several hardware/software analysis  tools.  The first, based on Trap-driven
              simulation, characterizes and evaluates  memory systems.  The second, a
              modified version of DECs ATOm analysis tool,  generates accurate software
              traces of the entire system's activity, including OS  and application
              workloads.  Together, the workloads, their characterization  worksheets and the
              tools will help architects determine how best to support  future software
              systems.
