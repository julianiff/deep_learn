Abstract    :
              This is a joint research and educational program that focuses on an
              interdisciplinary study of adaptive behavior in complex systems whole behavior
              is determined by the dynamics of interaction that do not lend themselves to
              simple models, abstraction, or simulation.  The project aims to develop a
              strong, coherent program of courses, seminars, laboratories, and research
              projects within the Brandeis Center for Complex Systems whose goal is to
              promote interaction among faculty from related fields, and to provide
              undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities for interdisciplinary
              research and training.  The project uses imitation as the domain for studying
              multi-representional cognitive systems, and applys it to three experimental
              areas: 1) dynamics simulation, using a physically realistic human model, 2)
              robotics, using a group of up to 24 mobile robots, and 3) software agents,
              using two different multi-agent simulations.  Imitation involves the
              interaction of multiple-representations from perceptual, memory, and
              action/motor subsystems, thus bringing up the key integration issue of
              Artificial Intelligence and Control.  Imitation is a rich domain for scaling up
              complete, multi-modal cognitive systems, and insights from this work can be
              applied to various applications spanning different branches of AI, including
              skill learning, automated assembly planning, cooperative multi-robot systems,
              and multi-agent cooperation.
