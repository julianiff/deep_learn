Abstract    :
              The proposal deals with open issues in ATM networks and mixed ATM wireless  
              networks.  The work will include four topics: 1) Scheduling in the ATM  
              environment.  Work will focus on generalizing their real-time scheduling  
              algorithm, which minimizes the weighted loss at an ATM node, to a network   and
              to non-real time traffic.  2) Traffic modeling and performance analysis   for
              bandwidth allocation in ATM networks.  Work will extend their   analytical
              techniques to capture the queueing behavior over an ATM network   for fairly
              general doubly stochastic arrival processes and address issues   of
              self-similarity, transient analysis, and dynamic bandwidth allocation.   3)
              Video transmission over ATM networks. The PI will capture cell-jitter in  
              order to size the receiver buffer appropriately and determine the startup  
              delay.  Further work will include error-concealment for transmitting video  
              traffic in a lossy ATM medium and ways in which flow control can be  
              implemented on non-real time traffic to improve the overall utilization in  
              the network. 4) Integration of wireless and ATM environments.  Work will  
              focus on ways in which dynamic bandwidth control can be accomplished, and  
              flow control and admission control in the mixed wireless environment can be  
              addressed.
