Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to develop methodologies for the   preparation of
              chiral metallic cavities for catalytic synthesis. The   concept is to build,
              via template methodology, a polymeric cavity into   which a metal can be placed
              and used as a chiral catalyst. In this   methodology, both the outer an inner
              sphere environments of the metal   catalyst shall be controlled. In the
              education portion of this grant, the   overall goal is to integrate organic and
              organometallic chemistry in   courses, research and seminars. Students will
              write papers and give   lectures on current literature topics which cover these
              two   sub-disciplines.  The ability to catalyze reactions efficiently provides
              the basis for   transforming readily available organic materials into numerous
              useful   products. For medicinal products, one additional feature is the
              control   of chiral topology. This research project supported by the Organic  
              Dynamics Program will address this issue by designing chiral polymeric  
              cavities into which chiral metal catalysts can be tethered. A variety of   test
              examples will be used to demonstrate the concept utility. The   education
              portion of this investigation will focus on the integration of   Organic and
              Organometallic chemistry. This will be done by course work,   seminars and
              research at both the undergraduate and graduate level
