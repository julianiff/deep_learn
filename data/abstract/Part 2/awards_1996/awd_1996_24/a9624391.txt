Abstract    :
              9624391  Pollock    Under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research Guidelines,
              the  Association of Science-Technology Centers under the direction of  Wendy
              Pollock and in cooperation with Lynn Dierking of Science  Learning, Inc. will
              examine the literature, current methodology,  and value of front-end studies in
              planning informal learning  projects.  The project "Front-End Studies: A
              Guidebook for Science  Museums" will result in a publication available to a
              broad audience  of practitioners developing informal learning programs.  The 
              objective of this work is to provide a resource that will encourage  more
              extensive and fruitful use of front-end studies.   Dissemination of results and
              abstracts of front-end study reports  will also be posted on the ASTC Home
              Page.  Research in science  learning makes it clear that it is important for
              those who provide  learning opportunities to begin with an understanding of
              what  learners know, what they don't know, what misconceptions they may  have,
              and what they are interested in learning.  The more that the  program design
              team understands about the learner, the stronger the  learning activity. 
              Unfortunately, not all informal educators  realize the value of front-end
              studies and incorporate them in  their program development protocols.  The
              value of this research is  to provide methodological guidance and research
              resources, along  with clearly developed arguments, for practitioners interest
              in  improving the conceptualization of the science learning activities.
