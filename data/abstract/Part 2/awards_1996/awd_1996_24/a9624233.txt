Abstract    :
              9624233  Akinwande  The CAREER proposal is in the area of field emission studies
              on vacuum microelectronic devices.  The research is concerned with scaling the
              operating voltages from 100V to 10V through the use of nanostructure technology
              to control the gate aperture, gate-to-emitter capacitance and emission beam
              spreading thpough the addition of a focus electrode.  In addition, studies will
              focus on the reduction of emitter workfunction and surface conditioning to
              provide current uniformity in the field emission arrays (FEAs).  The
              achievement of lower voltages will permit the integration of vacuum
              microelectronic devices with silicon-based CMOS or MMIC technologies.  Bandgap
              and surface engineering of semiconductors are explored to study the physical
              electronics of electron emission.  The research will impact the area of
              flat-panel displays (FPDs) as well as RF sources for microwave power
              amplifiers.  The education plan is to develop courses and a laboratory which
              emphasizes electronic display technology through the study of material,
              devices, circuits, optics and fabrication techniques.  ***
