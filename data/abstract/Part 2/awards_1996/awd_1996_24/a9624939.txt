Abstract    :
                    9624939  Krause      This  study will investigate the ecological factors
              involved  in  the   diversification of mammals 65 million  years  ago,  after
              the extinction of dinosaurs. Specifically, the goal of  the proposed research
              is to use tooth structure to infer the  diet  and  feeding  ecology  of the 
              archaic  ungulates,  or  "condylarths," the first major mammalian group to 
              diversify  on  the heels of dinosaur extinction. Although "condylarths"  are 
              believed to have given rise to the modern,  herbivorous  hoofed  mammals  -- 
              e.g., horses, cows,  and  elephants  --  "condylarths" themselves are often
              reconstructed as small to  medium-sized,    raccoon-like   dietary  
              generalists.    By  investigating  dental adaptations to diet in  these 
              extinct  animals,  this research will uncover factors that  may  have  been 
              important  to  the  recovery  and  diversification  of  "condylarths" after the
              mass extinction at the  end  of  the  Cretaceous.  Thus, this work is important
              for  understanding  the  ecological  factors critical to  recovery  from 
              biotic  stress and to the generation of biological diversity.
