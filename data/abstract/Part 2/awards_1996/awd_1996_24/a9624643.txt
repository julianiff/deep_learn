Abstract    :
              9624643  Soltis   The appearance of new species in nature is an important event.
              New species may arise in the plant kingdom in a number of ways, one of which is
              through the combined processes of hybridization (cross-breeding) of two
              different species, and polyploidization (chromosome doubling).  The result is a
              new, genetically distinct "polyploid" species that has twice the number of
              chromosomes as its progenitors.  Research funded by this award addresses two
              main questions about this process:  (1) Have the mating systems of the
              relatively young polyploid species diverged from mating systems of the parental
              species? (2) Has this combination of hybridization and polyploidization events
              occurred more than once in each species, and if so, how often?   The research
              utilizes a model system for the study of plant evolution, the genus Tragopogon
              (Asteraceae).  In Tragopogon, this type of species formation has occurred twice
              in the Palouse Region of the Pacific Northwest within the last 60 years.
              Understanding this process can provide new insights into how species can arise
              and what happens shortly after a species' origin.  Because the same events of
              hybridization and polyploidization characterize the histories of some of our
              most important crops (e.g., wheat), information on this evolutionary pathway
              has implications for crop improvement through breeding and genetic engineering.
