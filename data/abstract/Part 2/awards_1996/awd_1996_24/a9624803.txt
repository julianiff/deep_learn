Abstract    :
              Software distributed shared memory (DSM) systems provide the  abstraction of
              shared memory to networks of workstations and  distributed memory machines,
              such as the Paragon, CM-5, or SP-2.  Unfortunately, the latencies for global
              operations in either  environment are several orders of magnitude more
              expensive than  on tightly-coupled multiprocessors.  The result is that 
              current DSMs perform well for only a restricted class of  applications.  The
              Sparks project is designed to address this  restriction by providing a protocol
              construction library that  will allow DSM performance to be improved to within
              a few percent  of tightly-coupled multiprocessors.  Sparks' abstractions allow 
              the design space of high-level synchronization operations to be  explored
              cleanly and systematically, rather than in an ad hoc  fashion.  The emphasis is
              more on creating and investigating the  abstractions that make a broad variety
              of optimizations possible,  rather than on the individual optimizations
              themselves.  However,  the performance gains allowed by the synchronization
              types  created via the Sparks library will be thoroughly quantified. The 
              Sparks interface will be implemented in CVM, a new distributed  shared memory
              system.  In addition to providing support services  to Sparks, CVM implements
              novel coherence protocols and multi-  threading support.  ***
