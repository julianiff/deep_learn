              Colella    Various x-ray diffraction experiments will be carried out on  the 
              icosahedral phase of Al-Pd-Mn.  Since this alloy can be made into  a 
              quasicrystal with a high quality lattice structure,  dynamical  diffraction  is
               feasible.   The basic  question  still  remains,  "Where  are  the atoms?" and
              twelve years after the discovery  of  quasicrystals   this  question  has  not 
              been  fully   answered.  Experiments at Purdue and at the synchrotron light
              sources,  NSLS  and   CHESS,  will  include  quantitative  studies  of 
              anomalous  transmission (the Borrman effect), standing waves, and the use of 
              circularly   polarized   x-rays.   The   basic   issue   of   the 
              centrosymmetry will be examined.  An experiment will  be  carried  out  to
              determine the space group of the benzil molecular crystal  that  can  be  found
               in  two  enantiomorphic  space  groups  and  correlate optical activity with
              structure.  %%%  Various  x-ray  diffraction techniques, including experiments 
              at  the National Synchrotron Light Source and the Cornell High Energy 
              Synchrotron  Source,  will  be used  to  investigate  the  atomic  arrangements
              in quasicrystals.  These are new materials  that  do  not  exhibit  long  range
               periodicity as  do  most  other  solid  substances.   Their  high  strength, 
              low  density,  low  surface  friction,  and  good  oxidation resistance make 
              them  ideal  for  surface  coatings.  A company in France has set up  a 
              production  line  for using quasicrystalline coatings in frying pans  instead 
              of  Teflon.  Applications are envisaged for ball bearings,   Some 
              quasicrystals have exceptional qualities for hydrogen storage.  ***
