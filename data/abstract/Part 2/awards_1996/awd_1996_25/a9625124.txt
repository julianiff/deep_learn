Abstract    :
              9625124  Hout    This Dissertation Improvement research examines the emergence
              of ethnic inequality among Jewish men who immigrated to Israel during the first
              ten years of statehood (1948-1958).  Israel is unique because it was formed
              through massive, concentrated immigration form a variety of countries.  Despite
              significant heterogeneity in educational and occupational attainments among
              these immigrants, a bifurcated social structure emerged, such that Middle
              Eastern and North African Jews tended to be lower in both occupational status
              and control of economic and political resources than European Jews.  Using
              Israel's 1961 census, this research will compare occupation prior to
              immigration with occupation after immigration.  Specifically, the research will
              investigate the effects of ethnicity, class and a number of practical and
              cultural resources that enables an individual to translate prior occupational
              attainment into occupational attainment in Israel.  Using secondary historical
              materials, scholarly and media publications on Israel's ethnic gap, and Zionist
              writings, the investigator will examine the group-level processes that account
              for the role of ethnicity in Israel's occupational attainment system.  This
              research will increase our theoretical and practical knowledge of  the
              importance of ethnicity to individual opportunity, the utility of specific
              individual-level resources in combating ethnic discrimination, the relative
              roles of class and ethnicity in shaping macro-level ethnic inequality, and the
              level of conscious strategy present in ethnic competition for socially valued
              objects.   ****
