Abstract    :
              9625408  Horwitz, Susan  Association for Computing Machinery    Special Project:
               Group Travel Grant for Faculty at Minority/Female Institutions to Attend PLDI
              96    As a step toward improving the representation of women and minorities in
              computer science, the ACM Special Interest Group on Programming Languages
              (SIGPLAN) is working to improve the computer science background of faculty
              members from colleges with a large minority and/or female student enrollment. 
              This travel grant will provide partial support for selected individuals from
              such institutions to attend the annual conference on Programming Languages
              Design and Implementation (PLDI).  In addition to the Conference, the
              participants will attend tutorials targeted specifically to teachers from
              non-research oriented institutions.  For the selected participants, SIGPLAN
              will pay the tutorial and conferences fees and NSF funds will provide for
              travel and subsistence costs.  ***
