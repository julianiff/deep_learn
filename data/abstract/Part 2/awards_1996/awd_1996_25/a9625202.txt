Abstract    :
                In recent years, there has been a great deal of attention in  the software
              engineering community on the development of  techniques and tools that provide
              support for the design and  implementation of applications to be distributed
              across  networks of workstations. Some of this focus has been on  support for
              initial development and configuration of  applications while  other research
              has focused on techniques  to support these types of applications at run-time.
              One  novel aspect of workstation environments is that the number  of processors
              available for use tends to grow and shrink  over time. This aspect has caused
              increased interest in  dynamic reconfiguration techniques that allow
              applications  to adapt to their changing environment.    Much of the current
              research in dynamic reconfiguration has  focused on reconfiguration
              environments and heterogeneous  process migration. This research is developing
              techniques  for supporting dynamic structural and implementation  changes. The
              work has three parts: 1) studying general  approaches to implementing dynamic
              structural and  implementation changes to applications, including those 
              changes that require process participation, 2) determining  what aspects of
              this task can be automated, and 3) building  tools to support dynamic
              structural and implementation  changes. The most promising approach is one that
              enables  mapping the old global state of an application to a new  global state
              based on the structural changes to be made.    This CAREER project includes
              teaching initiatives geared  towards introducing undergraduate students to
              issues in the  design and implementation of distributed applications. The  goal
              is to improve training in an area where many students  get inadequate
              preparation for industry positions that  require knowledge in this domain.  ***
