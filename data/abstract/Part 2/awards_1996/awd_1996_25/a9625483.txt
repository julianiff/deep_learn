Abstract    :
              9625483 Krylov  ABSTRACT   The project concentrates on three areas:
              probabilistic solutions of PDEs, stochastic partial differential equations, and
              numerical solutions of control problems for diffusion processes. In the first
              area, the objective is to further develop the technique based on
              quasiderivatives mf solutions of Ito's equations and apply it for processes
              considered up to the first exit time from a domain.  In the second area, it is
              to investigate smoothness of solutions of SPDEs arising in filtering problems
              and population genetics in order to be able to guarantee certain rates of
              convergence of approximations to their solutions. In the third area, the aim is
              to get  estimates of the rate of convergence.    The project relates to
              investigations of probabilistic behavior of certain objects. Part 1 is aimed at
              better understanding of averaged quantities and is thought of as been important
              for parts 2 and 3. Part 2 aims at problems directly related to many practical
              issues such as image reconstruction or high-performance.  It is also vital in
              dealing with problems like evolution of bacteria populations, which may be
              important in biotechnology. Part 3 deals with problems of optimal control of
              random processes which arise, for instance, in finance.
