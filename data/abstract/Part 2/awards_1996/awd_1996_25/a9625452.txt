Abstract    :
              9625452 Eberlein The proposed research lies in the general area of   Riemannian
              geometry.  The investigator plans to study the geometry of   complete
              Riemannian manifolds of nonpositive curvature and rank 1, a   condition implied
              by but weaker than strictly negative sectional curvature.    Particular
              emphasis will be given to manifolds that are compact or are   simply connected
              and homogeneous.    More specifically, the investigator will pursue the
              following three topics:   geometry of compact rank 1 manifolds; geometry of
              simply connected 2-step   nilpotent Lie groups with a left invariant Riemannian
              metric; homogeneous   spaces of strictly negative sectional curvature. 
              Riemannian manifolds are   an abstraction of curved spaces possessing a
              distance function.  Unlike   curves and surfaces in 3-space these are abstract
              spaces in that they do   not necessarily lie in an ambient space.  The proposed
              research has to do   with understanding the large scale structure of certain of
              these spaces,   and looking at various examples coming from Lie group theory.
