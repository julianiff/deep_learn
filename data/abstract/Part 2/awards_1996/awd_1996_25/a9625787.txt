Abstract    :
              9625787  Wets    The unifying theme of this project is the convergence, in
              particular the epi-  convergence, of integral functions as they arise in
              stochastic optimization,   but also in other variational problems:  optimal
              control problems, the   calculus of variations, mathematical statistics, etc..
              The main reason for   concentrating on approximation questions is that although
              much is known   about the properties of integral functionals and much progress
              has been   made in the design of efficient and reliable optimization routines
              for finite   dimensional linear and nonlinear optimization problems, the use of
              these   routines to solve infinite dimensional problems has been hampered by  
              serious shortcomings in what we know about the approximation of infinite  
              dimensional optimization problems, in particular by finite optimization  
              problems.    Stochastic optimization models provide tools that support decision
              making   under uncertainty. These are ``decision'' problems whose data is only
              known   in a statistical sense, i.e., there is uncertainty about the values to
              assign to   some of the parameters of the problem, and at best one might have
              some   statistical information about these parameters.  Typical stochastic  
              optimization problems are: the choice of a flexible manufacturing plan   when
              the demand is not known with certainty, asset/liability management   problems,
              policy setting for pollution controls that are affected by   atmospheric
              conditions, the design of structures (such as bridges,   skyscrapers) that are
              going to be subjected to (randomly distributed) seismic   shocks, etc..
              Mathematically, stochastic optimization problems are very   difficult to solve
              because one must, in one way or another, take into account   all possible
              outcomes of these random parameters. That is why the design of   an
              approximation theory for such problems is essential, and that is what is at  
              the core of this project.
