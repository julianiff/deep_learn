Abstract    :
              Dr. James Espenson and Dr. Andreja Bakac of the Department of Chemistry,   Iowa
              State University, are supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and  
              Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division for studies to develop a  
              molecular level understanding of oxygen atom transfer. They will probe   the
              mechanisms of oxygen atom transfer reactions of transition metal   oxygen and
              oxo complexes. The studies include the use of the complex,   methylrhenium
              dioxide (MDO), as a prototype oxygen atom acceptor, and   inorganic oxyanions
              and transition metal oxo complexes as oxygen donors.    Kinetic and
              thermodynamic determinations will be carried out to construct   a scale of
              oxygen atom transfer reactivities on the basis of the Marcus   equation. The
              effects of hydrogen bonding on the stability of   superoxometal complexes will
              be studied using deuterium isotope effects,   and the chemistry of superoxo and
              oxo ions of biologically relevant   chromium complexes will be investigated. 
              Chemical reactions in which oxygen atoms are transferred from one metal   to
              another or from metals to non-metals are fundamental to many   biological and
              industrial processes.  However, advances in this area are   currently hindered
              by the lack of a fundamental understanding of these   processes.  In this
              project, Espenson and Bakac will determine the rates   and pathways by which
              oxygen is exchanged between various atoms, and they   will relate these studies
              to the current theory which describes electron   transfer reactions.  They will
              explore oxygen transfer systems with   industrial and biological relevance.
