Abstract    :
              9625549  Prange  This grant supports work of this senior, distinguished 
              theorist whose past contributions have ranged over a variety  of diverse areas
              in condensed matter physics.  More recently  the PI has been involved in the
              general area of quantum  nonlinear science.  This subject, on the interface
              between  quantum disorder problems and such nonlinear properties as  chaos and
              fractals is expected to have strong influence on  the emerging fields of
              nanoscale devices.  The PI has been  instrumental in a major conceptual advance
              in this field,  namely the removal of the divergence in a quasiclassical 
              approach.  This grant will further develop the applications  of the
              quasiclassical approach.  In another project the PI  will explore the synergism
              of the random matrix theory and  the quasiclassical methods in their
              application to the  properties of disorder at quantum scale.  %%%  Small scale
              (nanoscale) devices have properties whose  description sometimes poses a
              special mathematical  challenge.  In this continuing work of a distinguished 
              theorist, attempts are being made to try a variety of modern  mathematical
              techniques, such as random matrix theory and  quasiclassical approximation in
              search of a effective and  efficient computation of the material properties. 
              This work  will advance the state of quantum nonlinear science.  ***
