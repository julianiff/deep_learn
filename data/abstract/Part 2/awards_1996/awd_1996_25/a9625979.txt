Abstract    :
              9625979  Nagarajaiah  This project was submitted to the "Structural Control for 
              Performance, Safety and Hazard Mitigation Research"  competition.  The work
              centers on the development of  variable stiffness structural systems using a
              novel semi  active continuous variable stiffness (SACVS) device which  varies
              the structural stiffness and frequency continuously  and smoothly, without
              inducing impulsive forces and  maintaining nonresonant state under seismic and
              wind  excitation.  The main objectives of the project are: to  characterize the
              non-linear dynamics of the combined linear  structure and nonlinear-SACVS
              device by developing  analytical models and calibrating these models 
              experimentally; to develop control algorithms based on  intelligent control
              strategies such as neural networks; to  perform shake table testing of the
              SAVCS device in a  structural system; and to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
              SACVS system by comparing its controlled and uncontrolled  response, and as
              compared to a fully active system.  Results  from this research will contribute
              to the development of  innovative semi-active continuous variable stiffness
              systems  and their application to structural control which will  require less
              power to operate and will overcome limitations  of existing control systems.
