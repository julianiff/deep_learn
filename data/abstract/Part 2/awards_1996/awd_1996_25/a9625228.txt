Abstract    :
              9625228  Fischer  This research proposal addresses a major bottleneck in the 
              transformation of design information to construction  information: the lack of
              computer-interpretable  representations of construction methods that represent
              the  underlying assumptions behind a construction schedule,  support the rapid
              generation of construction schedules, and  provide the information link between
              a design and its  construction plan.  To support the rapid generation of 
              schedules, this research will develop and test strategies  that support the
              generation of schedules based on formal  construction method models, and
              develop and test a template  that captures construction method information
              necessary to  support the schedule generation strategy.  The educational 
              objectives are to enable students and practitioners to model  underlying
              scheduling assumptions and not just the schedule  itself, and to teach students
              to model and consider the work  of other disciplines in the preparation of
              their discipline-  specific schedules.  ***
