Abstract    :
              9625566  CHAN    "Women in the World of Earth Sciences" will be produced as a 30
              minute video aimed at  youths between the ages of 10 and 18. The video will
              feature women in earth science  careers and is meant to acquaint girls and
              young women with the opportunities available for  them in this male-dominated
              physical science field. The video will convey the idea that  women can enjoy
              and be successful in earth science careers. It will emphasize the relevance  of
              earth science and how women can make meaningful contributions to society in a
              science   field. The video will be professionally produced and distributed
              nationally.
