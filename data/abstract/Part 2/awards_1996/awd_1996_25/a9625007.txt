Abstract    :
              This CAREER proposal addresses new paradigms for exploiting and teaching 
              instruction-level parallelism (ILP).  Statically-scheduled microarchitectures 
              achieve high performance by relegating to the compiler the responsibility for 
              detecting and scheduling ILP.  Drawbacks to this approach include a lack of 
              object code compatibility between generations, the reliance on program
              profiles,  and the erosion of the individual compilation model.  This research
              will develop  new paradigms for ILP that remove the draw-backs by enlisting the
              OS, the linker,  the assembler, the instruction encoding and the
              microarchitecture.  The  educational plan will introduce the compiler's role in
              the undergraduate  curriculum as the sophomore and senior levels by developing
              two courses:  "Introduction to Machine Language Programming" will be modified
              to include an  awareness of performance issues and the role of the compiler;
              and a senior level  course will be developed to teach back-end ILP compiler
              optimization.  An  important feature of this proposal is the training of
              graduate students in a  fundamentally and technologically significant area of
              ILP.   The research and  educational activities will use the TINKER Instruction
              Set Architecture that has  been constructed by the principal investigator and
              his students.
