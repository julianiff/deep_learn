Abstract    :
              9625143  Whitcomb  This program of research pursues two complementary ideas
              toward  the synthesis of robots possessing exceptional yet flexible  dynamical
              dexterity:  (I) precise physical models and  (ii) adaptive learning.  The first
              idea is to incorporate precise  physical models of the robot and its
              environment into a robot's  computer control system.  By knowing the full
              physical dynamical  model of its limbs, a model-based robot controller can 
              automatically compensate for the nonlinear dynamical effects  (e.g., inertial,
              Coriolis, friction, hydrodynamic, and  gravitational forces) acting on the
              robot during motion. The  second idea is for robots to quantitatively learn the
              parameters  of their own physical structure and their environment, and to 
              adaptively compensate for changes in these parameters.  The  result is superior
              speed, precision, and dexterity.    Theoretical problems in robot arm control
              (Section 1.3) are  remarkably similar to the problems of underwater vehicle
              position  (Section 1.4) -- both industrial robots and underwater vehicles  are
              second-order Lagrangian systems exhibiting highly structured  nonlinear
              dynamics.  These ideas are to be employed in these two  real-world problem
              domains:              Nonlinear Adaptive "Learning" Control for Industrial
              Robot         Arms       Nonlinear Model-Based Control of Underwater Robot
