Abstract    :
              9625941  Kostant     This project deals with research in various topics related
              to representations and geometric quantization of classical as well as
              exceptional Lie groups. The investigator proposes to find new approaches to
              representing the character of an irreducible representation as the Fourier
              transform of a coadjoint orbit. Singular representations, the quantum
              cohomology ring of the flag manifold, and representations of a semisimple Lie
              algebra appearing in its exterior algebra are among the topics to be pursued.  
               Lie groups often arise as symmetry groups. For example, so called unitary Lie
              groups describe symmetries in elementary particles. Another example is provided
              by the Carbon 60 molecule, popularly known as the buckyball. Here the full
              symmetry group turns out to be an exceptional Lie group. There are only
              finitely many exceptional groups - whereas the number of classical groups are
              infinite - and much work has been done on how to realize them as subgroups of
              classical groups.
