Abstract    :
              9625451  Schlick  This proposal is directed to the study of self-assembling of 
              perfluorinated and protiated ionomers in the bulk and in  solution, as a
              function of the solvent, the ion content, and  the degree of neutralization. 
              The following experiments are  planned.  (a)  F-NMR spectra of perfluorinated
              ionomers as a  function of concentration will be measured in ethanol,  water,
              formamide and N-methyl formamide, solvents that span  a range of dielectric
              constants from 24 to 182.  The  lineshapes will be analyzed and compared with
              results for  perfluorinated polymers and short-chain perfluorinated 
              surfactants, to deduce the smallest unit that exists at low  concentrations,
              and the degree of aggregation.  (b)  The  diffusion coefficients of neutral,
              cationic and anionic  tracers in perfluorinated ionomers will be measured by
              ESR  imaging and correlated with the degree and type of self-  assembling of
              the polymer chains.  (c)  In an attempt to  understand the contribution of the
              backbone to self-  assembling, poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid) (EMAA) 
              ionomers in solution, and in the dry and solvent-swollen  state, will be
              studied by the spin probe ESR method and ESR  imaging as a function of the
              concentration of the ionic  monomer (MAA), to deduce the dynamics of the
              aggregates and  the curvature of the polymer-solvent interface.  (d)  ESR 
              imaging will be further developed in three main areas.  The  time required for
              data acquisition will be reduced by a  Fourier transform method for image
              reconstruction so as to  increase the range of diffusion coefficients that can
              be  deduced; the hardware and software necessary for 2D spatial-  spatial
              imaging will be assembled; and novel spin probes  designed to enhance the
              spatial resolution will be prepared.  %%%  The methods proposed for the study
              of, and collection of  data on, self-assembled ionomer systems are considered 
              important for the study of transport processes in drug  delivery systems; in
              ocular and intraocular lenses; in  preparation of  new materials, including
              catalysts; and in  biological systems that involve transport through cell 
              membranes.  ***
