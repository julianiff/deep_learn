Abstract    :
              This project involves three aspects.  First, it will attempt to investigate the
              impacts of the changing global climate on terrestrial ecosystems at global
              scale; second, it will tackle the handling of massive data sets from remote
              sensing of vegetation using parallel mechanisms employing the new IBM High
              Performance Storage  System (HPCC) connecting  the SP2 platform; and third; it
              will design parallel algorithms for ecosystems modeling.  All three aspects
              will be integrated to address the following scientific questions.  The seasonal
              amplitude of CO2 concentration has been increasing since at least the mid
              1970's, suggesting an increase in CO2 absorption through photosynthesis and CO2
              release through respiration.  In addition, the trough of the seasonal curve has
              been occurring earlier in the season, with the CO2 draw down occurring faster. 
              Assuming these phenomena are caused by the warming temperature and changing
              patterns in precipitation especially since mid-1970's, the PIs propose to study
              the interaction among climatic variables, terrestrial ecosystems, and
              atmospheric CO2 concentrations employing the massive datasets available through
              remote sensing technology and ground records.
