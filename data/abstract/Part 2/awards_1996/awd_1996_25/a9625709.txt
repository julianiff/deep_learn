Abstract    :
              SBR-9625709  Gregory Stone  Louisiana State University     This Small Grant  for
              Exploratory Research (SGER) supports a one-year program to measure the
              post-storm recovery of a particular barrier island on the north Florida
              (panhandle) coast, after Hurricane Opal (a Category 3 storm on the Saffir
              Simpson Scale, with sustained winds of 130 mph).  The measurements include: 
              beachfront core samples taken at 500-meter intervals monthly;  monthly sediment
              samples at a grid that includes a cross-section of five zones from step and
              mid-tide levels to upper-beach, new foredunes, and backbarrier areas;  daily
              meteorological data;  and daily wind direction and speed.  The most important
              of the process questions to be asked are the roles and the interactions of
              wind, wave, and current transport processes in the sediment erosion and
              deposition processes in post-storm recovery.  The National Parks Service will
              close the area to human activity for at least one year, so the investigator
              will be able to observe the natural process of regeneration     Our
              understanding of the initial phases of island recovery after severe storms is
              based primarily on supposition, largely governed by our interpretation of the
              day-to-day dynamics of barrier islands.  This research will generate
              high-quality field data, culminating in the development of a heuristic model
              designed to identify and elucidate the importance of separate yet interrelated
              post-storm recovery processes and the morphological features of the site.
