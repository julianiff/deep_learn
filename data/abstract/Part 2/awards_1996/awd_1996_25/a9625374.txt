              Infrastructure:  Scalable Multimedia Information Processing        This award
              is for the creation of a computer infrastructure that will enable realistic and
              practical demonstrations for future computing environments.  The award will
              allow researchers at Columbia University to upgrade their storage, networking
              and processing capabilities to conduct interrelated research projects in four
              major areas:  1)  High Performance Integrated Multimedia Information Systems;
              2) Visual Information Processing; 3) Mobile Multimedia User Interfaces;  4)
              Scalable Systems for Mobile and Portable Computing.  The requested research
              equipment, which is critical to support these research projects and will be
              treated as a shared resources, includes a data farm, a multimedia/visualization
              supercomputer, multimedia workstations, high-performance multimedia PC's and
              high-bandwidth networking hardware.
