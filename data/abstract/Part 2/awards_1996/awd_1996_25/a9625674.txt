Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, Shaka will develop a new pulsed nuclear magnetic  
              resonance (NMR) technique called excitation sculpting.  Strong DC   magnetic
              pulsed field gradients (PFGs) will be used in conjunction with   frequency
              sweeps to eliminate out-of-band signals, revealing the desired   excitation
              profile and resulting in significant advantages compared to   conventional
              pulse shaping.  Preliminary results show effective water   suppression using
              the new technique, in which protons bound to carbon-12   nuclei are suppressed
              without loss of the desired signal from protons   bonded to a carbon-13. 
              Combined with superior carbon-13 decoupling,   superb high-resolution
              absorption-mode proton multiplets are obtained.    Nuclear magnetic resonance
              spectroscopy is one of the most useful tools   in the chemist's arsenal. 
              Techniques are constantly being developed   which allow this method to be
              applied to more problems, so that more   information can be extracted from NMR
              spectra with respect to such varied   systems as inorganic materials and
              biologically important molecules.  The   excitation sculpting method being
              developed in this work is expected to   have a large impact on most important
              NMR experiments, including some   `routine` experiments carried out in NMR
              facilities everywhere.
