Abstract    :
              This project will continue a survey of communities of terrestrial vertebrates in
              the dry forests of western Madagascar, and to shift attention to transitional
              forests and some newly identified and remote montane forest islands of unknown
              composition. Twenty-four sites in these various habitats will be surveyed over
              a 36-month period, using methods employed successfully in an earlier study of
              rainforest habitats on Madagascar. The arid forests of western Madagascar
              contain some of the most interesting and unusual species of plants and animals
              in the world, and the biodiversity of these forests is at present poorly
              understood.  The dry forests are degraded and threatened to at least the same
              degree as the rainforests, and their destructionis accelerating as the demand
              for resources increases. The primary purposes of this study are to 1) identify
              areas of high diversity in order to assist in the development of protected
              areas, 2) document species distributions on the Internet, 3) describe new
              species that may be encountered, 4) produce guides for field identification, 5)
              obtain specimens for systematic studies, 6) train Malagasy students,
              scientists, and resource managers, and 7) develop a national Museum of Natural
              History in Madagascar. The results, when combined with data from the earlier
              studies, will give a comprehensive picture of the diversity of most of
              Madagascar's terrestrial vertebrates, which will be essential to conservation
              planning for Madagascar into the future.  |        H H     + (с?сG Р F G ( n
