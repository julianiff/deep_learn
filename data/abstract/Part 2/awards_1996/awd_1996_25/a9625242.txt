Abstract    :
                  The goal of this proposal is to develop a model of turbulent  fluctuations
              and transport in the magnetopause current layer.  It  continues work on the
              microphysics of the magnetopause by applying  the investigator's model for the
              current convective instability to  the magnetopause and to use the results to
              explore some of the  macroscopic consequences.  In particular, a fundamental
              goal is to  obtain anomalous transport coefficients for the current diffusion 
              which can then be incorporated in global MHD codes.  The  theoretical work
              proposed here is fundamental to developing an  understanding of magnetic
              reconnection and anomalous transport at  the magnetopause, which are thought to
              be key mechanisms for the  transport of solar wind plasma into the
              magnetosphere.
