Abstract    :
              This research investigates formalization and automation techniques for design of
               asynchronous systems.  Techniques for design of asynchronous systems. 
              Techniques  for managing multiple, independently synchronized domains under a
              methodology in  which timing and communication can be explicitly specified,
              synthesized, and  verified are being explored.  specific tools and techniques
              being developed for  the design of mixed-timed systems include: a performance
              and power optimizing  compiler; a synthesis tool to produce
              technology-independent circuits; a  technology mapping tool that takes the
              implementation and maps it to high-  performance gate libraries; and a timing
              verification tool.  In addition, new  design methods are being developed to
              produce: high-performance mixed-timed data  paths, and an interface between
              synchronous and asynchronous modules.    The PI's education plan includes: 
              curriculum emphasis on communication skills  through course project reports and
              presentations; development of new computer  engineering courses; promoting
              interdisciplinary activities; incorporating  research activities into the
              curriculum through class and summer projects; and  fostering interaction with
              industry through student summer internships.
