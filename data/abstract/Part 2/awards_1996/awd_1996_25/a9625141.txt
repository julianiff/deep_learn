Abstract    :
              9625141  Farwell    This award is to develop a validated, mobile system for the
              preparation and delivery of test gas mixtures.  In addition to testing
              analytical performance features such as detectability, dynamic range,
              precision, and selectivity, the improved system will enable the assessment of
              method response times by varying the test gas concentrations with time in a
              rapid, controlled manner in order to more realistically mimic atmospheric
              conditions.  Reliable measurements of tropospheric sulfur gases such as sulfur
              dioxide, dimethyl sulfide, and others are important for our understanding of
              the albedo effect of sulfate aerosol produced from marine biogenic emissions,
              acidic precipitation, and the biogeochemical sulfur cycle.  In the absence of
              absolutely known standards, which do not exist for sulfur dioxide and other
              sulfur gases, intercomparison experiments involving several different
              measurement methods present the best forum for assessing the quantitative
              reliability of these methods.
