Abstract    :
              Hao  9625183    This is an award to provide support for research aimed at 
              developing an approach to modeling nutrient removal from  wastewater by use of
              suspended growth bioreactors based on  coupling the use of artificial neural
              networks with  knowledge of the underlying biological processes that take 
              place within the reactors.  The investigators plan on using  a hybrid modeling
              approach that combines a simplified  process model and a neural network, the
              purpose of which is  to correct any errors encountered by use of the simplified
               model.  Two hybrid modeling methods involving a series  structure and parallel
              structure will be used to integrate a  suspended growth reactor model and a
              neural network.  The  approach will be explored for potential use in both 
              sequential batch reactors and in a system for alternating  aerobic and anoxic
              conditions.    Results of this research are expected to enhance the  procedures
              by which complicated biological processes can be  designed, controlled and
              optimized.  The proposed concepts  to be investigated in this project are
              expected to enhance  process control in general and lead to engineering designs
               that save energy in meeting stringent requirements for  removal of nutrients
              from wastewater prior to their  discharge to the environment.
