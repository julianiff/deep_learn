Abstract    :
                 9625420 Deligne   It is almost thirty years since conjectures of Robert
              Langlands changed the direction of research on automorphic forms and
              representation theory.  This award provides support dor a conference on the
              Langlands program. The objectives of the conference are (1) to bring the ideas
              of Langlands before a wide mathematical audience; (2) to describe recent
              developments in major areas of the Langlands program; (3) to attempt to
              anticipate future directions of work on the problems making up the Langlands'
              program.  The Langlands program is part of number theory. Number theory is the
              study of the  properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of
              mathematics. From the beginning problems in number theory have  furnished a
              driving force in creating new mathematics in other  diverse parts of the
              discipline. The Langland's program is a  general philosophy that connects
              number theory with calculus;  it  embodies the modern approach to the study of
              whole numbers.   Modern number theory is very technical and deep, but it has
              had  astonishing applications in areas like theoretical computer  science and
              coding theory.
