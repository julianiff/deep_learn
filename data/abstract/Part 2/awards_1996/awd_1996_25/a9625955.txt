Abstract    :
              Nonsmooth optimization problems involve objectives or  constraints which are not
              differentiable everywhere.  The term  structured nonsmooth optimization means
              that the specific  nonsmooth nature of the problem is known.  One especially 
              interesting class repeatedly arises in many applications:  problems involving
              eigenvalues of matrices.  The proposed work  primarily focuses on various
              aspects of eigenvalue optimization,  including semidefinite programming,
              quasiconvex eigenvalue  optimization, and non-Lipschitz eigenvalue
              optimization.    The goal is fourfold: the development of fast, robust
              numerical  algorithms;  analysis of theoretical questions concerning 
              optimality conditions and algorithm convergence; development of  software which
              can be used by the general scientific community;  application to the solution
              of important interesting problems  which arise in practice.  Application areas
              of particular  interest include combinatorial optimization, robust control and 
              structural analysis.  ***
