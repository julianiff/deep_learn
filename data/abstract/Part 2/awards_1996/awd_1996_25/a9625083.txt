Abstract    :
              This award supports a unified program of research and education in parallel 
              input-output systems for high-performance computing.  Research activities will 
              include development of tools for I/o performance evaluation, applying the tools
               to characterize I/O performance of scientific codes, and provision of compiler
               support for parallel I/O.  Educational activities span the needs of graduate
              and  undergraduate students, and include outreach to K-12 and the community. 
              These  include development of a graduate course, augmentation of undergraduate 
              curricula, and workshops for participants outside the university.
