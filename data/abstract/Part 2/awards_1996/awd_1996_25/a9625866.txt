Abstract    :
              96625866  Horwitz    We seek to replicate, document, and study an informal
              educational  experiment, performed last year, that successfully taught 
              Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity to largely minority  students at an
              inner-city high school.  Although the students had  very little knowledge of
              mathematics and physics, the approach  adopted was similar in all respects to
              that pioneered with second-  year physics students at an excellent suburban
              school during a  previous NSF-supported project. The results, too, were
              similar-a  striking finding given the disparity in preparation of the two 
              student populations. This indicates that the use of advanced  educational
              technology, coupled with research-based pedagogy, may  have an even more
              dramatic effect in inner-city schools than in the  suburban ones in which it
              has traditionally been applied. The aim  of the proposed project is to acquire
              and communicate hard evidence  bearing on this conclusion.  ***
