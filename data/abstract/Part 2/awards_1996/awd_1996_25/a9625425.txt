Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to intestigate the celebrated Hirsch  conjecture using the
              new theoretical framework that was developed  recently by the investigator and
              collaborators for resolving  the conjecture.  In contrast to all of the
              previous attacks on  the conjecture which were inherently combinatorial, the
              new  strategy brings to bear on the conjecture the powerful machinery  of
              continuous analysis and representation theory of continuous  groups. 
              Preliminary results from the new approach include (i)  the discovery of a new
              formulation of the Hirsch conjecture with  connections to Gaussian elimination,
              and (ii) the emergence of  the most compelling theoretical and empirical
              evidence to  date about the validity of not just the Hirsch conjecture but a 
              considerably stronger version of it.    The project aims at proving the strong
              Hirsch conjecture by  employing powerful techniques from differential geometry
              and  cohomology theory.  The strong Hirsch conjecture, if proved,  would show
              the existence of exponentially many paths of linear  length between the initial
              and optimal vertices of a polyhedron,  and would hence revitalize the research
              for polynomial-time  Simplex algorithms.  ***
