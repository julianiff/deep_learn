Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program   will assist
              the Department of Chemistry at Brown University acquire   computer systems to
              upgrade the existing computer network. This equipment   will enhance research
              in a number of areas including the following: (1)    interfacial dynamics of
              hydrogen in metals (2) quantum simulations of   adsorbed hydrogen on metal
              clusters  (3) trial wave functions and   invariants, and (4) vibrational
              relaxation of polyatomic molecules in   liquids.     A network of fast, modern
              computer workstations is a new way to satisfy   the computing needs of
              chemistry departments.  Such a `computer network`   also serves as a
              development environment for new theoretical codes and   algorithms, provides
              state-of-art graphics and visualization facilities,   and supports research in
              state-of-the-art applications of parallel   processing.
