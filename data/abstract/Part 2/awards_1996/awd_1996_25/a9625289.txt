Abstract    :
              This project investigates basic research in computational  geometry that is
              well-motivated by applications in geometric  computing.  Specific focus is
              given to the construction and  maintenance of geometric structures, as well as
              methods for  efficiently searching in such structures, with principle 
              motivating applications coming from computational metrology,  computational
              graph drawing, and geometric information retrieval.  Emphasis is placed upon
              the design of algorithms for single  processors as well as methods for
              exploiting coarse-grain  parallelism such as exists in systems with parallel
              disk arrays  or clusters of workstations.  ***
