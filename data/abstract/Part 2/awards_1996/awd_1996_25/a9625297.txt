Abstract    :
                This project focuses on the design of approximation  algorithms for NP-hard
              problems arising in two important  application areas:  (1) design of networks
              and (2)  computational molecular biology.  The work involves  the development
              of general techniques to solve classes of  problems in both areas, applying and
              extending tools from  the area of approximation algorithms, such as the primal-
               dual schema, bicriteria formulations and approximations,  and using
              graph-theoretic arguments in the proof of  performance guarantee. In
              particular, the issues addressed  in the area of network design include
              improved algorithm  for minimum-cost survivable network design by extending the
               primal-dual method, and a generalization of the Steiner  tree problem with
              covering requirements.  In the area of  computational molecular biology, the
              areas of investigation  include the application of bicriteria approximation
              methods  to the physical map assembly problem, and fundamental  questions in
              multiple sequence alignments -- local, global  and tree based.  The Integrated
              Educational Plan of this  CAREER Grant includes (a) participating as Resident 
              Scientist in the DIMACS High School Teacher Education  Program in Computational
              Biology, (b) developing a``more  modern'' undergraduate cross-disciplinary
              computational  biology at CMU, (c) establishing and running a graduate 
              research seminar for doctoral students in the Algorithms,  Combinatorics and
              Optimization Doctoral Program at CMU, and  (d) developing new graduate courses
              in network design and  approximation algorithms.***
