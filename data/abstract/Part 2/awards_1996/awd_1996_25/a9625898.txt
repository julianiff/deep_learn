              This award supports CES associate Kathryn Fisher. Diagrams are fundamental to
              hardware design.  Designers use them extensively to convey details, to express
              properties, and to reason informally about designs.  Despite this, little
              attention has been paid to supporting diagrammatic reasoning in verification. 
              As a result, a substantial gap exists between design practice and verification
              methodology that makes performing verification difficult for designers.    The
              project aims to bridge this gap through a logic developed around common
              hardware representations.  The logic has five syntactic representations: three
              diagrammatic and two sentential.  The inference rules support reasoning with
              information from multiple representations, thereby providing formal support for
              how diagrammatic information is used in practice.    The practical objective is
              to investigate whether this logic makes verification easier for designers.  A
              verification tool based on the logic will be implemented and evaluated
              alongside existing methodologies by both novices and experienced practitioners.
               The main theoretical objective is to examine how diagrammatic information can
              help refine the current boundaries between automated and interactive
              verification methodologies.  The integration of these approached will be an
              important feature of the tool  ***
