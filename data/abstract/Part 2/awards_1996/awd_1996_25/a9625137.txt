Abstract    :
              9625137  Ma  The objective of this project is to develop a combined research and
              educational program in biomagnetic imaging engineering.  The research work
              includes (1) the implementation of high quality Na, H, and P receiver coils for
              magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy using high temperature
              superconductor materials, (2) the improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio of 
              MRI images for medical applications, and (3) the development of high
              temperature superconducting quantum interference device for magnetocardiogram
              studies.  The research efforts will be incorporated into the development of new
              curriculum for undergraduate and graduate student training in advanced
              biomagnetic sensing and imaging technology.  ***
