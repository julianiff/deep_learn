Abstract    :
              Dr. Hurt's proposed research on carbon formation in flames is designed to
              establish a link between the carbon mesoscale structure (lying between the
              atomic and macroscopic scales) and the combustion conditions.  Experiments
              involving specialized heat treatment techniques using rapid time-resolved
              quenching on model carbons and precursors followed by sample structure
              characterization are proposed.  In addition models will be developed to
              describe the mesoscale structures of the carbons and compared with the
              experimental results.  The PI?s educational plan was considered innovative
              especially the involvement of undergraduates in research.  He has developed
              good relationships with industry and national laboratories.
