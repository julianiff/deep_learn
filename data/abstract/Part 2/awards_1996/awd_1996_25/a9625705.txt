Abstract    :
              The goals of this research are two-fold:  to develop and analyze efficient
              parallel iterative solvers with effective preconditioners that arise in
              solid-liquid computational simulations; and to parallelize a solid-liquid
              computational simulation for the NSF Grand Challenge Particle Simulation
              Project.  In this particle simulation, the motion of solid particles in flowing
              fluid is carried out using an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian finite element
              method with a moving particle-fitted unstructured grid.  This formulation
              results in a nonlinear system of equations that is solved at each time step
              with a modified-Newton method.  Using the modified-Newton method gives rise to
              nonsymmetric linear systems that are solved with a preconditioned GMRES
              iterative method. The first focus of this research is to efficiently solve
              these nonsymmetric linear systems by developing robust and effective parallel
              preconditioners for iterative solving.  Moreover, a library of parallel
              numerical algorithms will be developed to solve nonlinear algebraic systems
              using variants of Newton's method and to solve sparse nonsymmetric linear
              systems using preconditioned iterative methods.  The library will be portable
              across a range of parallel machines and will be placed on the public domain. 
              The parallelization will be carried out using the general methodology and
              optimization techniques developed in Oplus (Oxford Parallel Library for
              Unstructured Solvers).
