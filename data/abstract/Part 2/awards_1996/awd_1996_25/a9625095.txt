Abstract    :
              Abstract - Morrison - 9625095    Research Portion:  The goal of this research is
              to develop a new, fundamental understanding of the chemistry found in radio
              frequency (RF) induction plasmas using novel in situ Fourier transform infrared
              (FTIR) diagnostics.  The research will initially investigate methane plasmas
              and the growth of amorphous carbon films (diamondlike carbon or DLC) while
              performing the in situ FTIR measurements.  Although well known for their
              hardness, recent preliminary research indicates that these films would be
              outstanding gas permeation barriers and useful in field emission displays.     
              Education Portion:  Engineering education has a mismatch between the learning
              styles of the students and the teaching styles of the faculty.  In addition,
              the students have difficulty grasping the interdisciplinary nature of chemical
              engineering which draws on concepts from mathematics, chemistry, physics, and
              other engineering disciplines.  To address these issues, the education plan
              will begin developing hypertexted class notes for an undergraduate class in
              fluid mechanics.  Hypertexted class notes allow the learning process to adapt
              to the learning style of the student as well as provide much opportunity for
              feedback to the instructor; it also frees the instructor to spend class time
              demonstration problem solving skills rather than writing on the board.  As the
              hypertexting grows, links to other course work becomes possible, emphasizing
              the multidisciplinary nature of engineering.
