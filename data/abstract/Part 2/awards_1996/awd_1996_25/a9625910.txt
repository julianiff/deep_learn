              Program:  Research in Computer Aided Design of VLSI Circuits with Emphasis on
              Deep Submicron Technology    This award supports associate John P. Lillis. 
              With the advent of deep submicron technology, the VLSI community is now faced
              with many new technical challenges which are currently inadequately addressed
              by the state of the art in Computer Aided Design for VLSI circuits.  Because of
              the scaling of feature size in the submicron domain, performance of VLSI
              systems is now largely dominated by interconnect delay.  Some powerful
              techniques for addressing this interconnect dominance are timing optimization
              by buffer insertion, wire sizing and performance driven routing.  We propose
              that the time during the award period be used to further develop these
              techniques into a mature, cohesive set of tools.    Among the research
              objectives of the proposals are    (1) development of algorithms for routing
              and buffer insertion to address the problems of electromigration and crosstalk
              noise,  (2) experimental evaluation of gate replication techniques for timing
              optimization and  (3) integration of the optimization techniques at a higher
              level in the physical layout process which included circuit placement.      All
              of these topics are of great practical importance in deep submicron systems of
              today and the future.
