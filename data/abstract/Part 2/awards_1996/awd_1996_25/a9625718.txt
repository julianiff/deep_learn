Abstract    :
              9625718  Pilinis   Atmospheric aerosol particles consist of solid and liquid
              multicomponent phases.  Some aerosol chemical constituents are sulfate,
              nitrate, ammonium, sodium, chloride, water, soot, organic matter, and dust. 
              These species are not distributed evenly among particles of different sizes. 
              As a result, the physical, chemical, and optical properties of particles of
              various sizes may differ. The nonhomogeneous distribution of chemical species
              within aerosol particles of different sizes are factors which currently
              introduce uncertainty into models which attempt to quantify direct forcing
              effects by atmospheric aerosols.   Research conducted under this award will
              support the development of an aerosol model which accounts for the major
              processes that shape the size distribution and composition of atmospheric
              particles.  Aerosol optical properties, including single scattering albedo,
              phase functions, asymmetry factors and upscatter fraction will be calculated
              for use in column radiative transfer models.  The radiative transfer models
              will be used to calculate the direct aerosol forcing over shortwave and
              longwave radiation fields.  The PI will evaluate the model by comparing model
              results with measured aerosol concentrations and aerosol optical properties. 
              Once tested, the model will be used to estimate the effects of uncertainties in
              model input parameters to direct forcing due to aerosols.  ***  ATM-9625718
