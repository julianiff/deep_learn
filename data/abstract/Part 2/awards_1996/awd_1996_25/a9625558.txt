Abstract    :
              This project is exploring the cluster approach to symmetric multiprocessing, in 
              which bus-based multiprocessors are interconnected using a more scalable
              network.   Using the Tempest parallel programming substrate, the project is
              building  clusters that extend the shared memory model with fast references to
              recently  used locations across a cluster.  The key issue is achieving good
              performance  without resorting to extensive custom hardware.    The project
              encompasses design and some implementation of a high-speed Tempest  system that
              can: provide shared memory across a cluster; use cacheable control  registers
              and queues for communication among processors and I/O devices; and  provide
              hardware acceleration of protocols.  The project includes the development  of
              programming tools and compilers that facilitate specification and verification 
              of custom protocols, and use these protocols to hide latency.
