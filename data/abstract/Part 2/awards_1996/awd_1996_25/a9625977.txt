Abstract    :
              9625977  Safinya  This award provides support for a comprehensive research 
              program to develop x-ray microbeam diffraction and direct  imaging techniques
              based on Bragg-Fresnel optics (BFO).  The  objectives of the development effort
              are:  1.) to develop  high quality Bragg-Fresnel optics by employing the state
              of  the art nanofabrication technologies, with an ultimate goal  of producing
              Bragg-Fresnel lenses (BFL) with 50 nm  resolution and efficiencies 40%; 2.) to
              develop experimental  methods for effectively utilizing BFL's in a broad array
              of  x-ray characterization methods, including high resolution x-  ray
              scattering and diffraction, and nanostructure  characterization of electronic
              materials; and 3.) to develop  nanometer resolution hard x-ray amplitude and
              phase contrast  microscopy methods in the energy range of 8 keV - 100 keV.  The
              utilization of BFO-based microfocusing diffractive  optics with third
              generation synchrotron sources (the  Advanced Photon Source (APS) with high
              brilliance and  coherence, will significantly enhance our ability to probe  the
              mesoscale structures of complex materials and biological  systems.    %%%   
              Research projects benefiting from this new instrumentation  covers broad areas
              in complex materials and biological  systems, including structural
              characterization and direct  microscopic imaging with hard x-rays of
              biomolecular  materials, micron sized protein crystals, complex fluids,  and
              nanostructures.    ***
