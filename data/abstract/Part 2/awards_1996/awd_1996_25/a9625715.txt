Abstract    :
                      9625715  Patten  PIs proposed a three year program of research that will
              establish  the effectiveness and implementability of semiactive vibration 
              absorbs (SAVA) for bridge impact vibration control. The purpose of  this
              proposal is to conduct a long term study of the engineering  issues raised by
              the application of SAVA to the ODOT (Oklahoma  Dept. of Transportation) test
              bridge.  The research will examine  the testing of different control algorithms
              including feedback  linearization, and a nonlinear bi-state control that is
              based on an  extension of Lyapunou's method.  Work will be conducted to verify 
              the performance developed and tested.  The research will also  address the
              question of best topologies for actuators, including:  (a) kinematic
              arrangement of actuators; (b) optimal location and  placement of actuators; and
              (3) effect of number of actuators.
