Abstract    :
              9625392  Smyth    This project lies in the area of differential geometry and
              submanifold theory. The investigator plans to pursue the Caratheodory
              conjecture (a sphere in 3-space must have at least two umbilics), the stability
              conjecture for continuously differentiable maps in two variables, and function
              theoretic aspects of minimal surfaces. In addition, they will examine principal
              curvatures of hypersurfaces.    Submanifold theory deals with various
              properties - metric, topological, global and local - of curves and (hyper-)
              surfaces lying in Euclidean and sometimes more general spaces. An important
              consideration in submanifold theory is to understand how extrinsic properties
              of a submanifold interact with its intrinsic properties. This project contains
              two of the outstanding conjectures in this area; attempts to interface with
              other areas of mathematics such as dynamical systems theory and algebraic
              geometry.
