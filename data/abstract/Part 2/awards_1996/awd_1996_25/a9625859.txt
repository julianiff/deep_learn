Abstract    :
              Reasoning  tasks in spatial, temporal, and physical  domains  often involve
              quantities at vastly different scales. A cross  country  trip of three thousand
              miles begins by  backing  up  the  car  six feet; the 150 foot Challenger
              rocket  exploded  because  of a 1/200 inch gap in the O-rings; the shining  of 
              the  sun is explained in terms of the interaction of nuclear  particles. 
              Automating  such  reasoning  raises  issues   of  representations and inference
               techniques that do not  arise  in  reasoning at a fixed scale, particularly in
              cases  where  the  level  of  detail  and  the  precision  of  information 
              available  varies widely across different  components  of  a  single  system.  
              A  number  of different  aspects  of  this  problem  are  under study,
              including  calculi for  order  of  magnitude  reasoning; the use of dimensional
              and  structural  hierarchies;   and the composition of physical  theories  of 
              different granularity. The result of this research will be a  body  of tools
              and  techniques for reasoning across multiple  scales that can be used in
              automated physical reasoners over  many different domains.
