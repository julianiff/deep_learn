Abstract    :
              With this GOALI award the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and the  
              Synthetic Organic Program are supporting the educational efforts of Dr.   Brian
              P. Coppola and Christine E. Evans of the Department of Chemistry at   the
              University of Michigan and Dr. Anthony W. Czarnik, Director of   Biochemistry
              for the Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research headquarters of   the
              Warner-Lambert Company.  This team of academic and industrial   chemists will
              formally extend the integrated architecture that is being   created for the
              professional development stream in the undergraduate   program at the
              University of Michigan chemistry department.  This novel conceptual design will
              have two parallel outcomes.  The first   result is a new undergraduate course, 
              Professional Development in the   Chemical Sciences, taken during the Junior
              year.  The subject matter of   the course will include critical analysis of
              written and oral   presentations, written and oral technical communication
              proficiency, and   an introduction to the multi-faceted features of
              professional life   including professional ethics.  The creation of this course
              is a unique   educational bridge between the traditional content of
              undergraduate   programs and the needs of beginning a professional life in
              chemistry.    Second, it is proposed to strengthen this bridge further by
              creating a   parallel set of course materials and objectives, through an  
              academic-industrial partnership, that also address the needs of  
              post-baccalaureate chemists who are already in practice.  In addition to   the
              traditional undergraduate course structure, the team will explore   alternative
              modes of delivery that might better address the needs of the  
              post-baccalaureate population.
