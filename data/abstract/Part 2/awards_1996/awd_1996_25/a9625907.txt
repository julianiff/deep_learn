Abstract    :
              Zhang  9625907  The investigator studies high order mixed finite element 
              methods on tetrahedral meshes for the 3D stationary Stokes  problems, and the
              iterative solvers for the resulting discrete  linear systems of equations. 
              Preliminary work done by the  investigator finds a family of stable mixed
              elements on some  macro-element type grids.   This result indicates the
              possibility  of finding the minimal polynomial degree of continuous piecewise 
              polynomials for the velocity where one degree less piecewise  polynomials are
              employed to approximate the pressure and the  mixed elements are stable; this
              has been an open problem for more  than a decade.   The investigator studies
              various augmented  Lagrangian methods (including the well-known Uzawa method
              and the  iterative penalty method) where the effective multigrid method  or/and
              domain decomposition method are combined to achieve the  optimal order of
              computation.  The difficulty in the design of  both the mixed elements and the
              iterative methods is to treat the  incompressible condition.  The investigator
              develops computer algorithms for some  well-known equations in incompressible
              fluid dynamics.  Problems  of incompressible computational fluid dynamics arise
              throughout  industry and science.  There are difficult challenges in 
              developing these methods involving limits of computer memory and  speed,  as
              well as accuracy and robustness of the method itself.  The algorithm is
              expected to have applications to areas such as  airfoil design and to
              manufacturing processes involving fluid  flow in complex shapes, for example,
              the chemical industry.
