Abstract    :
              9625593  Holbrook    This Americas Program award will support Dr. Noel M. 
              Holbrook, Harvard College, Cambridge, to visit Caracas,  Venezuela to plan a
              research proposal in collaboration with  Dr. Ernesto Medina, Instituto
              Venezolano de Investigaciones  Cientificas (IVIC), Caracas, Venezuela.  The
              objective of  the visit is to plan the development of a collaborative  study of
              tropical plant physiology and plant environmental  biology using hemiepiphytic
              plants as a model system.  Hemiepihytes are plants that spend a portion of
              their life  without access to the water and nutrients held in the soil,  and
              part of their life with root connection to the ground.  Venezuela is an
              appropriate study location because of the  diversity of hemiepiphytic species
              found there and the wide  range of habitats in which they naturally occur.   
              The purpose of the visit is to select the field areas that  will provide the
              necessary combination of access ,  protection from human disturbance, and
              marked seasonality in  rainfall for the proposed study.  ***
