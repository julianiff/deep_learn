Abstract    :
              The method of Least Squares has been employed successfully to solve problems in 
              many scientific disciplines, including signal processing.  The class of fast 
              Recursive Least Squares Algorithms was introduced in order to address certain 
              desirable performance traits, such as computational complexity, tracking, and 
              misadjustment.  Although these algorithms have evolved over many years and are 
              widely used in signal processing, a common approach addressing the issue of 
              algorithmic stability has been lacking.  This research provides an analysis
              that  fills this critical void in the research and development of these
              algorithms.   Descriptive definitions of stability are being examined which are
              consistent with  current and previous algorithmic analyses.  The effects of the
              forgetting factor  - the extent to which prior information is weighted - with
              respect to matrix  perturbation theory and the control and propagation of
              arithmetic roundoff errors  are being studied.  This research is also providing
              useful and insightful gains  in the important areas of filter misadjustment,
              filter tracking, the conditioning  of the auto-correlation matrix, and the
              usefulness of the filter output.    This research program joins the science of
              Numerical Analysis with the science  of Signal Processing, providing tools by
              which algorithms for signal processing  can be better designed and used, so
              that they will give more accurate results.
