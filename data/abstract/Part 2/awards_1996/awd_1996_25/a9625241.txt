Abstract    :
                The proposal describes an investigation of magnetospheric dynamics  using
              various activity indices and sophisticated non-linear  analysis methods.  The
              proposed research has three goals: 1. to  examine the size and frequency of
              active magnetospheric periods and  to determine the degree of non-linearity of
              the magnetospheric  response to the solar wind drivers, 2. to investigate the
              stability  of the solar wind - magnetosphere - ionosphere system, and 3. to 
              determine predictive functional relationships between input and  output
              variables.
