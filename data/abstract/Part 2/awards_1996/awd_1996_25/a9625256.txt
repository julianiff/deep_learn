Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to design synthetically applicable,  
              regioselective and stereoselective radical chain processes.   One   approach
              will involve improvement of the efficiency of various radical   processes
              through catalysis and, whenever possible elimination of the   need for external
              reagents.  A second area of interest is the control of   regioselectivity and
              stereoselectivity through the use of radical cations   and solvent effects. 
              Thirdly, the effect of beta-oxygen groups in   diastereoselective radical
              reactions will be probed.  With this renewal   award, the Synthetic Organic
              Program is supporting the research of Dr.   David Crich of the Department of
              Chemistry at the University of Illinois   at Chicago.   Professor Crich will
              focus his work on three aspects of   free radical chemistry, namely catalysis
              of radical chain reactions,   chain processes involving radical cations and
              diastereoselective radical   reactions.   These basic studies will lead to the
              development of reaction   chemistry of great potential use to synthetic
              chemists.
