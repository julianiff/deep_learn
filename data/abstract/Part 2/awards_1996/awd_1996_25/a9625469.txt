Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT  EEC-9625469    There is an increasing need for integrated
              industrial relevant research addressing building interior environments and
              energy efficiency.  The United States has been among the leaders in research in
              these areas but has lagged behind Europe and Japan in the implementation of the
              research results.  This planning grant will provide funding for a planning
              meeting to determine if companies will support the research program and the
              viability of a Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for the
              Built-Environment at the University of California, Berkeley.    The research
              proposed for industry's consideration at the planning meeting will address: 1)
              Laboratory and Field Studies of Task/Ambient Conditioning (TAC) Systems, 2)
              Development of Field Methods to Evaluate Indoor Environmental Quality, 3)
              Development of an Advanced Human Thermal Comfort Model, 4) Design Tool for
              Thermal Assessment of the Local Environment (DTALE), 5) Took Kits for Improving
              Building Operation and Energy Performance, 6) Development of Improved Software
              for Thermal Analysts of Windows and Construction Assemblies.      The Principal
              Investigator and his colleagues are nationally recognized researchers in their
              fields and are eminently qualified to administrate this planning meeting.
