Abstract    :
              DMS 9625412  Efromovich        This research on curve estimation focuses on
              optimal   adaptive nonparametric time series estimators that are: (i)
              asymptotically   efficient for different loss functions, (ii) well performing
              for the case   of small sample sizes in comparison with peer oracles based on
              underlying   curve, (iii) efficiently data-compressing for problems arising in 
               environmental problems like monitoring quality of water or the analysis of  
              global change via marine magnetic anomaly; (iv) robust to distribution of noise
                and long covariance observations. The asymptotic analysis is based on the
              study of   local empirical processes, modern probabilistic results for mixing
              sequences   and sharp data-driven estimators of spectral density. Data-driven
              estimators   for the case of small sample sizes are explored both theoretically
              via   oracle inequalities and numerically via intensive Monte Carlo study.  
              %%%     The research involves the development of optimal methods for the   
              recovery of images that arise in different scientific problems including:   (i)
              secretion of  hormones such as insulin secretion where   no other methods have
              been successful so far due to noisy, long-dependent   and indirect data; (ii)
              monitoring quality of water based   on the analysis of large, correlated and
              sparse data sets that have undergone   efficient, computationally intensive
              data-compression;   (iii) timing of geological events, including plate motions
              and climatological   variations; (iv) testing and modeling properties of new
              materials.      ***
