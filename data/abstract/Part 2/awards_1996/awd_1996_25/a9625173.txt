Abstract    :
              9625173  McClamroch    This proposal describes a plan for research on
              stabilization of  an equilibrium solution of an important class of nonlinear 
              control systems.  Although supervisory or logic-based switched  feedback
              controllers have been studied in a variety of contexts,  our interest is to
              exploit them to achieve closed loop  stabilization when alternative smooth
              feedback stabilization  approaches are either not available or do not provide
              the  required performance.  We plan to study stabilization of a  special but
              important class of nonlinear control systems, that  include nonholonomic
              control systems and related nonlinear  control systems as a subclass, using
              supervisory control.  Our  motivation arises from the fact that nonholonomic
              control systems   are well known not to be asymptotically stabilizable using
              smooth  (time invariant) feedback. Fundamental research questions are  posed
              whose solution should provide important new insights into  nonlinear
              stabilization and control using supervisory control  feedback. The proposed
              theoretical research will be carried out  in connection with a parallel study
              of applications of  supervisory feedback control, primarily to classes of 
              underactuated mechanical systems. The outcomes of the proposed  research should
              contribute to the synthesis of classical  nonlinear control methodology and
              intelligent control methodology.  ***
