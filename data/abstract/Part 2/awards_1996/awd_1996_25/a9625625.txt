Abstract    :
                9625625  Ritter  The tribochemical deposition of ceramic surface films on 
              ceramic substrates will be explored under an SGER award.  Initial studies will
              involve ambient temperature rubbing of  alumina substrates by sapphire balls in
              various gaseous  atmospheres.  The resulting films will be characterized for 
              growth rate, microstructure, composition, adhesion, and  strength.
