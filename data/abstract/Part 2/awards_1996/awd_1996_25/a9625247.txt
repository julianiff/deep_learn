Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT  EEC-9625247    This "TIE" project is a two-year collaborative
              research effort of the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC)
              for Engineering Tribology at Georgia Institute of Technology and the
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center Machine Tool Systems at the
              University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.    The research addresses the
              tribological aspects of fixturing for machine applications, finite element
              modeling of the fixture-workpiece system, and experimental verification of
              contact mechanics in fixturing.  The I/UCRC for Tribology Engineering will
              study the behavior of fixture -workpiece contact; the I/UCRC for Machine Tool
              Systems will study the finite element modeling of the system; both I/UCRCs will
              verify the model.    Both Centers are cost sharing this "TIE" Project.
