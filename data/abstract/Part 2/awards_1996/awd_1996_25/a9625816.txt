               This award supports associate Anshuman Razdan.  At a high level, this research
              aims to develop a methodology for the computer representation of complex
              objects such as bone surfaces.    Anthropologists and bio-medical engineers are
              restricted for lack of mathematical structure of data that can be analyzed, an
              example being the surfaces of bones.  Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD)
              techniques will be applied to convert this unstructured data into a structured
              form.  Dense point cloud data will be used to describe the discretized surfaces
              as a smooth parametric NURB (Non Uniform Rational B Spline) surface(s).  Data
              reduction techniques will be developed to reduce the amount of data required to
              describe the surface(s).  3D tools will be developed to facilitate
              interrogation and analysis of these surfaces, to quantify measures  such as
              curvature.  The research will collaborate with a physical anthropologist at the
              new inter-disciplinary facility on campus, called PRISM.  The surface models
              will also generate the STL (stereolithography format) files for 3D hard copy
              outputs on rapid prototyping machines.  These can be used as tactile models for
              research into human morphology and the teaching of comparative anatomy and
              bio-engineering courses.
