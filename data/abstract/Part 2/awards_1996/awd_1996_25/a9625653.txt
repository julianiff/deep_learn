Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT    Dingle & Baker  IBN 96-25653    Fitness Consequences and
              Individual Strategies of Natal  Dispersion         Although movement behavior
              profoundly influences the  persistence and genetic structure of populations,
              and the  spread of favorable mutations, invading species, and  parasites, it
              has been studied less than other behaviors and  life history traits.  Animals
              must balance costs of movement  with potential benefits, and their strategies
              may be  affected both by genetic and ecological factors, and the  algorithms
              used to evaluate habitat.       Dispersal in the desert isopod, Hemilepistus
              reaumuri  will be studied.  The simplicity and manipulability of this 
              semelparous isopod s life cycle make it uniquely suited for  study of movement.
               The costs of dispersal in the field, as  well as habitat selection and
              learning will be measured.  These measurements will be integrated in a dynamic
              model of  natal dispersal to understand how dispersal costs and  habitat
              quality affect dispersal strategies and decisions,  and how decisions can
              change with time and individual  condition.  Dispersal costs will be measured
              in terms of a)  survival as a function of distance or time dispersed, b)  time
              lost to growth or mate  attraction, and c) condition in  terms of lost energy
              or water and its effect on survival and  lifetime reproductive success. 
              Comparisons of the success  of naturally chosen breeding burrow sites and
              experimentally  imposed random sites will be made; the effects of past 
              experiences of habitat quality and its variability on  selectivity and
              dispersal distance will also be examined.
