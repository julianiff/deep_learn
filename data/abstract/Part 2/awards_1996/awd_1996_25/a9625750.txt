Abstract    :
                          9625750  Singh  The proposed research is aimed at developing a
              fundamental  knowledge base concerning crack propagation and fracture 
              behaviors of ceramic fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites.   This
              objective will be accomplished by performing in situ crack  propagation
              measurements of stresses in fibers bridging the crack  at the process zone,
              using Laser Raman Spectroscopy, and relating  these stress measurements to
              local in situ crack opening  displacements and crack profiles.  The proposal
              provides a well  thought out series of experiments which can reveal key 
              information concerning the stress field and crack aperture shape  and the
              effect of varied interfacial traction (coatings).  This  study should enhance
              modeling efforts to determine fundamental  science and behavior predictions of
              importance in ceramic fiber-  reinforced ceramic matrix composites.  ***
