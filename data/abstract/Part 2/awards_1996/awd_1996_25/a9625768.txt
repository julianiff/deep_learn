Abstract    :
              9625768  Beilinson       The project deals with a geometric version of
              Langlands' correspondence  in which the role of automorphic forms is played by
              D-modules on the moduli  space of principal bundles on a complex curve, and
              that of Galois  representations, by the local systems on the curve.  It appears
              that the  theory of chiral algebras provides a powerful method for constructing
               the 'automorphic forms' corresponding to the 'Galois representations,'  which
              may eventually lead to complete understanding of the Langlands  conjectures in
              the geometric situation.       The Langlands conjectures appear to be among the
              deepest visions  of modern number theory; at the moment there seems to be no
              clue to  understanding them in full generality.  However, the parallel 
              statements in the geometric situation (technically, with the number  field
              replaced by the field of rational functions on a complex curve)  seem to be
              much more manageable, because of the machinery of chiral  algebras (originated
              in mathematical physics).  These parallel  statements are to be addressed in
              this project.  ***
