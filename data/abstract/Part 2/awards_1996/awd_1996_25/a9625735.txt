Abstract    :
               Amherst  This starter grant award to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst
                will support the research of Professor Scott M. Auerbach.  The theme of   the
              research is catalysis and transport in molecular sieves.  The present   studies
              focus on aluminosilicates that are microporous (zeolites), as   well as those
              that are mesoporous (for example, MCM-41). Study of the   chemical dynamics of
              zeolite acid proton transport and hydrocarbon   reactivity is advanced by new
              methods in classical and quantum reaction   rate theory.  Chemically selective
              catalysis and transport is modelled by   adjusting the electrostatic and steric
              properties of the framework,   compensating ions, and sorbates.  Also examined
              is how derivatizing   MCM-41 can have different effects on polar and nonpolar
              diffusants.  The   research models selectivity in trapping and storing
              fluorocarbons in   zeolites, addressing how halogen substituent effects control
              diffusion in   micropores.  This research will advance understanding of the
              properties of microporous   and mesoporous materials useful for solving
              important technological   problems.  Zeolites are used for separating chemical
              mixtures, as   environmentally safe detergents, and as catalysts in petroleum
              cracking.    Mesoporous sieves show promise for separating biomolecules and may
              be   useful for making optical electronic materials with substantial quantum  
              confinement.
