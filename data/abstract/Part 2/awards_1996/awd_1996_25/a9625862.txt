Abstract    :
              Whose  aim  is  to  investigate the integration  and  impacts  of  residential 
              Internet  use  among a  sample  of  some  100  urban  families  in 
              Pennsylvania  and  some  200  small-town  Minnesota  families. The Internet and
              commercial online services are growing  rapidly  with  a  substantial portion
              of  this  growth  occurring  through   connections   to  homes.  The 
              telecommunications   and  computing  industries  are  reorganizing  to  provide
               electronic  services to households through computer-based telecommunications. 
              Despite these changes, we have little understanding of how people  at  
              home---in   their   roles  as  family   members,   students,  participants  in 
              the  labor force,  as  members  of  groups  and  communities,   or  as 
              citizens---would  use  the  new   services  available to them. Similarly, we
              have little understanding of how  these  services, once they are used, will
              affect peoples'  lives.  This  research project capitalizes on an ongoing field
               trial  of  residential Internet use that has been developed with  industrial 
              sponsorship. There are three questions driving the research: What  leads to
              diffusion and domestication of technology in homes?  How  do  electronic 
              groups develop? What impact do electronic  groups  have  on  peoples'  social 
              support, information,  and  household  influence?  The  goal of this NSF-funded
              project  is  to  address  these questions by developing new measures, designing
              experiments  and  field  studies, and analyzing data that is  being  collected 
              from the field trial, focusing on intra-family interactions,  the  development 
              of electronic groups, and the impact  that  Internet  use has on relations
              within and among groups.
