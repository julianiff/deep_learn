Abstract    :
              9625597    This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement research examines the impacts
              of social movements on political and social change through a study of the
              Mississippi civil rights movement.  Research on the civil rights movement has
              focused primarily on the period up to the passage of the Voting Rights Act in
              1965 which is often regarded as the final chapter in the southern civil rights
              movement.  Many important struggles took place after 1965 at the local level as
              movements tried to shape electoral politics, increase access and improve the
              quality of public schools and secure public resources like Headstart and
              Community Action Programs.  This research employs two research strategies to
              examine the trajectory and impact of the local civil rights movements in
              Mississippi after the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  First, quantitative
              county-level data will be used to examine the movement's impact on electoral
              politics, primary and secondary educational institutions and social services. 
              Second, an intensive examination of three communities will be conducted through
              archival research and informant interviews.  This will be used to further
              elaborate and develop the quantitative analysis.  The research will increase
              our understanding of the role of social movements in political and social
              change and the outcomes of such movements.
