Abstract    :
              9625557  Kuh  This project will study learning models in  noisy and changing
              environments.  The environments are generally unknown and are learned through
              observation examples presented at discrete times. Previous research  has
              modeled and analyzed how supervised learning algorithms (algorithms where
              inputs receive labels) behave when confronted with slowly changing
              environments.  This research  will continue to analyze the behavior of
              supervised learning algorithms, but will focus on more complex reinforcement
              learning algorithms.  The primary objectives are to obtain a better
              understanding of reinforcement learning methods to problems in signal
              processing and communications.  Two  applications areas that are well suited to
              reinforcement learning approaches are sequential detection problems and
              networking problems. ***
