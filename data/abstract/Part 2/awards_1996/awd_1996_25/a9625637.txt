Abstract    :
              9625637  Hennage  This proposal is for support of an Optical Society of America 
              topical meeting on Biomedical Optical Spectroscopy and Diagnostics.   The
              meeting integrates experts and novices from the fields of  biomedical
              engineering, electrical engineering, chemistry,  biochemistry, chemical
              engineering, biophysics, physics, and  biology in order to discuss new advances
              and create new  opportunities for biophotonics, which overlap with those
              objectives  recently identified in an NSF workshop panel which sought to 
              identify research opportunities for multi-disciplinary research and  education
              in "Optical Science and Engineering," the resulting  initiative in OS&E and the
              National Research Council's "Committee  on Optical Science and Engineering"
              (COSE).  The goal of the  conference is to satisfy these aims by bringing
              together those  investigators who have a common intellectual curiosity in
              tissue  and tissue optics and who have a breadth of experience in the 
              analytical and physical sciences.  ***
