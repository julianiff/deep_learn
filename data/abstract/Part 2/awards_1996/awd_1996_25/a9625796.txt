Abstract    :
                    9625796  Clarke  This project is to examine the small scale electronic 
              interconnect damage processes of electromigration voiding and  interfacial
              decohesion which affect the reliability of integrated  electronics.   These are
              highly localized phenomena which are  affected by temperature (from Joule
              heating) and stresses.  The  length scales are much smaller than those of
              standard mechanics  experiments and therefore new experimental techniques are 
              required.  The proposed measurements are based on the shift and  broadening of
              both the Raman lines of silicon and the R-line  fluorescence of sapphire as a
              function of temperature and stress.   By exciting the spectra with a finely
              focussed laser the local  temperature and stress can be measured.  A novel
              micromechanics  test will also be used to measure fracture resistance of 
              interfaces.  ***
