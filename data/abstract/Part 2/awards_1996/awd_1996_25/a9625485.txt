Abstract    :
              9625485  Muthukumar  Theoretical studies will be done on the following: (1) 
              thermodynamics of polyelectrolyte solutions; (2) relaxation  and transport of
              polyelectrolytes and liquid crystals in  random environments; (3) topological
              frustrations associated  with pattern formation and complexations; (4) phase 
              separation kinetics in liquid crystalline systems.  Full  mathematical
              expressions will be derived to describe the  nonuniversal features of (1) the
              fast and slow dynamics  accompanying the `ordinary-extrordinary' transition in 
              polyelectrolyte solutions; (2) pattern recognition and  transport of
              polyelectrolytes in random media; and (3) phase  separation kinetics and defect
              dynamics of polymer dispersed  liquid crystals.  This theoretical research
              complements many  experimental investigations which are being actively pursued 
              in laboratories worldwide.  The results of this theoretical  research are
              relevant to numerous applied areas such as  separation techniques like
              chromatography and  electrophoresis; preparation and processing of molecular 
              composites and light shutters for devices; and controlled  fabrication of
              nanoscale structures and artificial enzymes.  %%%  This grant supports
              theoretical research on polymers and  complex fluids.  A wide variety of
              problems will be  addressed.  The fundamental issues which will be 
              investigated have ramifications in many applications.  ***
