Abstract    :
                     de Jong 9625417   This proposal plans to investigate one of the
              fundamental questions  currently being studied in arithmetic geometry, namely
              the invariance  of certain cohomologically defined invariants using various
              cohomology  theories, especially l-adic (etale) cohomologies for varying l and
              p-adic  (rigid) cohomology. The questions to be asked are whether dimensions of
               certain spaces are independent of l, whether the eigenvalues of 
              correspondences acting on certain groups are independent of l, whether the 
              eigenvalues of Frobenius are independent of l, etc. It is conjectured that  the
              answers to these questions are all positive.  This project falls into the
              general area of arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest
              areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has proved
              extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
              generations.  Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes.  Such
              codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
