Abstract    :
              9625992  Gastaldo    This grant provides $7,750 in support of the costs  of
              acquiring a modified Fisher 1650 MV aluminum  boat with a 40 hp Mercury
              outboard and an aluminum  vibracore rack and working platform for the 
              Department of Geology at Auburn University.  This  equipment is essential to
              the PI's active field  research programs studying tropical and temperate  plant
              taphonomy in fluvio-deltaic systems both in  the southeastern U.S. and also in
              southeast Asia.  The new equipment will replace a twenty year old  jon boat and
              trailer which are nearing the end of  their useful life and present potential
              safety  hazards.  The vibracore rack and working platform  are necessary to
              conduct both water column and  vibracore sampling from the boat.  The PI's 
              research on the fate of plant materials in recent  sedimentary environments are
              of fundamental  importance for understanding the palynological  fossil record. 
              Additionally, the use of this  equipment provides valuable field experiences to
               graduate and undergraduate students.  ***
