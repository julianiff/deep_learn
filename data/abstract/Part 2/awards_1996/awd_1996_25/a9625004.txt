Abstract    :
              9625004  Pines  This is a Faculty Early Career Develop (CAREER) award.  The 
              project involves integrating  research and education to advance  the technology
              of  smart materials and structures and techniques  to remotely monitor damage
              in large civil structures.  The  research focuses on the development of a smart
              civil structure  with embedded piezoelectric sensors for inferring structural 
              damage.  The research will emphasize the integration of embedded  sensors,
              actuators and processors into load carrying members of  large civil structures
              for the purpose of remote damage  detection.  Throughout the course of the
              research, analytical and  experimental results will be incorporated into the
              Clark School  of Engineering interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate 
              curriculum which includes courses on structural dynamics, smart  structures,
              earthquake engineering and nondestructive evaluation.  The goal is to develop a
              parallel approach that bridges the gap  between theory and reality.  Students
              will be involved at all  levels of the program, including analysis, design,
              construction  and the dissemination of results.  ***
