Abstract    :
              This research is a study of fundamental issues arising in multi-user  
              communications in environments subject to severe interference and/or noise  
              conditions. Important applications include mobile, indoor, and PCS wireless  
              systems and two-way hybrid-fiber coax (HFC) networks for broadband services  
              to the home. The research addresses three broad topics: (i) optimum and  
              near-optimum demodulation of multiple-access signals, (ii) the influence of  
              interference and communications techniques (e.g., modulation, demodulation,  
              coding, power control) on system capacity, and (iii) robust multi-user  
              detection and interference suppression. These topics address important  
              challenges to practical realization of high-performance multi-user  
              communications in wireless, HFC and other environments.
