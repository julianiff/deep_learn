Abstract    :
              9625793  Vesilind    This is an award to support research, the objective of
              which is  to obtain a better understanding than now exists of factors that 
              affect thickening and dewatering of suspensions of biologically  active solids.
               The investigator's initial objective is to  synthesize a suspension using
              polystyrene latex particles to  simulate bacteria, alginate to simulate
              microbial extracellular  polymers, calcium as source of potential bridging
              cations, and as  yet unknown component to simulate flocculation.    Research on
              biologically active suspensions of solids has been  hampered by their
              variability.  Results of this research aimed at  developing a synthetic
              equivalent of these suspension has the  potential of significantly improving
              our understanding of their  behavior when subjected to sedimentation and
              dewatering.  This  improved understanding in turn has the potential for
              improving  the engineering design of new bioreactors processing systems for 
              treatment of domestic and industrial wastewaters and in operation  of existing
              systems.
