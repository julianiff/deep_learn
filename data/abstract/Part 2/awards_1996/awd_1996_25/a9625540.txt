Abstract    :
              This proposal will fund the MISETA (Multi-Instrumented Studies of  Equatorial
              Thermosphere Aeronomy) II Campaign by relocating a  University of Michigan
              Fabry-Perot trailer in Chile and monitoring  the neutral thermospheric winds
              from a second site south of  Arequipa, Peru.  The addition of a second
              Fabry-Perot site will by  critical to understanding wind gradients centrally
              involved in  generating ionospheric structures at equatorial latitudes.  The 
              trailer will be refurbished, relocated to Antofagosta, Chile and  run in the
              oxygen red-line mode to provide thermospheric wind and  temperature
              measurements, and returned to Ann Arbor.***
