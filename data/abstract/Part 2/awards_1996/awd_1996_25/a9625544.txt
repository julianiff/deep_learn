Abstract    :
              9625544  Loveland  This workshop will assess the achievements, opportunities and
               goals of the field of automated deduction.  Some key researchers  of the field
              and a sample of users of the technology will be  assembled to address in
              particular the impact of automated  deduction on other fields, present and
              future.  This workshop  will produce reports to NSF and the larger scientific
              community,  identifying the major accomplishments, and discussing future 
              directions, for the automated deduction field.  ***
