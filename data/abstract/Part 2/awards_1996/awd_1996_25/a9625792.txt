Abstract    :
              This projects focuses on development of scaleable parallel Molecular Dynamics
              (MD) code to study the behavior of diblock copolymers under shear.  Fast
              parallel algorithms have been developed for simple fluids and for short range
              MD, but algorithms that can handle polymeric chains are not available. 
              Besides, current algorithms only deal with equilibrium problems, whereas there
              is a need to study problems with added shear flow.  Several groups, have
              studied the equilibrium phase diagram of diblock copolymers by means of
              simulations.  Simulations have not as yet been used to study their
              experimentally observed, rather complex, dynamic response.  Symmetric diblocks
              in equilibrium make a transition from a low temperature, ordered (lamellar)
              phase to high temperature, disordered phase at the order-disorder transitions
              temperature (TODT).  Application of shear changes the value of TODT.  Ordered
              phases are observed even above the quiescent TODT.  The shift in TODT has been
              predicted theoretically for very long polymers. For short diblocks- on which
              experiments are underway in Kramer's group at Cornell-theoretical predictions
              is not exist and one has to rely on simulations instead.  This project will
              also study factors that influence the orientation of lamellae.  Experimentally,
              different orientations have been observed, but which mechanisms play a role in
              the choice of preferred direction is not, as yet, well understood.
