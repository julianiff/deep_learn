Abstract    :
              This research project investigates the tight integration of  program generation
              facilities into typed languages. Present  program generation technology can be
              classified as either  integrated with the language environment, as are macros
              in  Lisp, or external to the language, as are yacc and lex for  C. Within
              language-integrated generators, the taxonomy can  be further refined into
              tightly-integrated generators,  exemplified by reflective systems, and
              loosely-integrated  generators, such as macro preprocessors. Tight integration 
              of generators into typed languages gives rise to a number of  problems to which
              solutions must be found.  However, the  benefits of increased expressiveness,
              efficiency,  productivity, reusability, reliability, and quality makes 
              research into solving these problems worthwhile. If the  project is successful,
              it will provide a clearer semantics  to a reflective ML-like language tailored
              for building  generator systems, illustrate how such a reflective language  can
              be restricted to maintain the invariants of strong  typing, design a
              meta-programming system to prevent variable  capture or design hiding, and
              build a programming  environment where generated code can be seamlessly 
              integrated with code produced in more traditional ways.
