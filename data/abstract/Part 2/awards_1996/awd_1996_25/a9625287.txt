Abstract    :
                  A fundamental problem of magnetospheric physics is to understand  the
              failure of the magnetosphere to make a smooth transition from  a state of slow
              convection and low dissipation to one of fast  convection and high dissipation
              in response to enhanced coupling of  solar wind energy into the magnetosphere. 
              A magnetospheric  substorm initiates the transition.  The precise physical
              mechanisms  that occur at auroral breakup and trigger the substorm have yet to 
              be determined.  There is a long established theoretical belief that  the
              triggering mechanism involves the growth of a localized plasma  instability in
              the near-Earth plasma sheet.  Plasma simulations in  2-D, however, have not
              been able to produce such an instability.   This proposed effort will initiate
              a series of 3-D particle and  hybrid simulations with the goal to determine if
              the localised-  instability hypothesis is correct.  Various instabilities
              including  (drift kink, collisionless tearing, interchange/ballooning, lower- 
              hybrid drift, cross-field streaming, ion Weibel, etc.) will be  considered and
              examined.  The large-scale 30D simulations will be  implemented on
              massively-parallel computers using a very efficient  General Concurrent
              Particle-in-Cell algorithm.  Only large scale 3-  D kinetic simulations of this
              type can determine the role of  various localized plasma instabilities in
              destabilizing the near-  Earth plasma sheet.
