Abstract    :
              Dr. David A. Atwood, Department of Chemistry, North Dakota State   University,
              Fargo, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic
              Program of the Chemistry Division and by the Experimental   Program to
              Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) for studies of the   chemistry of Group
              13 complexes.  The fundamental chemistry of cationic,   anionic, and neutral
              complexes will be investigated, which could lead to   the development of
              applications in Lewis acid and Ziegler-Naata catalysis   and in nanoparticulate
              oxide synthesis.  The education component of this   project integrates teaching
              with research, and fundamental with applied   chemistry through the formation
              of courses which emphasize synthesis,   catalysis and solid-state materials in
              ways that relate the chemistry to   applications and uses in daily life.  This
              project addressses the synthesis of new compounds with Group 13   metal ions
              such as aluminum and gallium.  Synthetic strategies will be   developed, and a
              wide range of molecular and solid-state characterization   techniques will be
              used to study the fundamental chemistry of these   systems.  Fundamental
              developments in the chemistry of these systems   could lead to applications in
              catalysis and solid-state materials.
