Abstract    :
              This project will address a central algorithmic problem in computational
              physics, namely, reliable calculations for strongly interacting quantum
              mechanical systems that obey fermion statistics.  Some examples of such systems
              include high-temperature superconductors, heavy-fermion metals, and magnetic
              materials.  The challenge lies in the correct and accurate treatment of
              microscopic correlations, which is essential to understanding the properties of
              these systems and their theoretical and technological implications.  The
              project will be based on a recently developed algorithm for treating correlated
              many-fermion systems on a lattice, the Constrained Path Monte Carlo (CPMC)
              Method.  It consists of three separate but closely related parts: (1) The
              Ground-State Properties of Prototypical Lattice models for Electron
              Correlation; (2) Finite Temperature; (3) Continuum Systems.  All of this will
              be done in the context of scaleable parallel computing algorithms, a critical
              aspect of the problem of studying lattice models of great relevance to
              high-temperature superconductors and heavy-fermion materials.  A new version of
              the CPMC algorithms will be developed for finite temperature calculations. 
              This will enable studies of thermodynamically properties and true phase
              transitions.  This project will also extend the algorithm to the continuum,
              which will enable more realistic calculations of materials.
