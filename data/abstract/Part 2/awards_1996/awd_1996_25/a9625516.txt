Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to provide a forum for six  faculty members from
              various institutions to present results  of their NSF-supported research in
              undergraduate engineering  education. The Frontiers in Education Conference
              (FIE'95)  will bring together approximately 400 professors, engineers, 
              information specialists, K-12 teachers, graduate students,  and others involved
              in the advancement of engineering  education for an intense three days of
              interaction. With the  theme "Engineering Education for the 21 st Century," the
               conference will be focusing on new technologies and methods  for improving
              engineering education. Thus the showcase will  provide an excellent opportunity
              for dissemination of  research results to a wide and appropriate community of 
              scholars and practitioners.    Inviting PI's who have developed exemplary
              products such as  computer-based curricula, textbooks, and curricula which 
              attract and retain traditionally underrepresented  populations in the
              engineering disciplines, not only  showcases NSF-supported educational
              research, but also  provides opportunities for one-on-one interaction, hands-on
               interactive experiences, stimulating exchanges of ideas, and  enhancements in
              the uses of innovations in science,  mathematics, engineering and technology
              education at all  levels.
