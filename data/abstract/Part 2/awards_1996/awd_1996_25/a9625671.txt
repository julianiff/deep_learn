Abstract    :
              This project will study the lubrication behavior of confined thin films using
              non-equilibrium molecular dynamics techniques.  In particular, mixtures of
              branched and linear alkanes with ester impurities will be studied.  The goal is
              to understand the effect of the impurities on properties such as the
              generalized shear viscosity and hydrodynamic boundary conditions.  Complicated
              long ranged electrostatic and metal-fluid interactions, plus necessarily large
              system sizes, present a significant computational challenge that will require
              efficient use of massively parallel computing facilities.  Existing algorithms
              and others currently under development employ Nose-Hoover chains and external
              fields to establish the desired velocity profile at the chosen temperature. 
              Furthermore, linear response theory can readily be applied to make the
              connection between phenomenological properties, such as the Navier-Stokes
              equation, and molecular descriptions.
