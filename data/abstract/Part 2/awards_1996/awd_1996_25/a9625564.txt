Abstract    :
              9625564  PFEIFFER         The University of Delaware will operate the R/V CAPE
              HENLOPEN  during 1996 as a general oceanographic research vessel in support  of
              NSF-supported research projects.  The HENLOPEN is a 120' vessel  owned and
              operated by the University.  The vessel is scheduled for  a total of 189
              operational days during 1996, of which 158 are in  support of NSF-supported
              investigators.  The remaining cruises will  support Navy projects.  The
              projects scheduled on the HENLOPEN span  all oceanographic disciplines and will
              fully utilize the  capabilities of the vessel.  All operations are along the
              U.S. mid-  Atlantic coast, including Delaware and Chesapeake Bays.
