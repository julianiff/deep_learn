Abstract    :
              9625489  Tsitsiklis   This project deals with problems of sequential decision
              making under uncertainty that are too large for the classical methods of
              dynamic programming.  The focus is on approximate dynamic programming which is
              a rich field that combines classical dynamic programming, reinforcement
              learning and other methods from artificial intelligence, approximation theory
              and neural networks, and simulation.  The objectives of the research are as
              follows:  (1).  Resolve several outstanding question related to
              simulation-based methods involving lookup table representations.  (2).  Provide
              a theoretical understanding of approximate dynamic programming methods, when a
              compact representation of the cost-to-go function is employed.  In particular,
              identifying classes of algorithm/architecture combinations for which
              convergence is guaranteed, together with error bounds.  (3).  Develop the
              theory and algorithms for average cost approximate dynamic programming.  (4). 
              Develop the theory and algorithms for approximate dynamic programming for the
              case of Markov games.  (5).  Carry out a number of case studies that will
              provide a better understanding of the comparative performance of different
              methods, and to demonstrate the usefulness of the methods on realistic problems
              of real-world importance.  Three case studies involve:  (a) Dynamic scheduling
              of a fleet of trucks (b) Pricing of complex derivative financial instruments.
              (c) The game of football.   The overall objectives are to provide a
              comprehensive mathematical foundation for the field of approximate dynamic
              programming and at the same time succeed in solving some difficult and
              important problems.
