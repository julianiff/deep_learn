Abstract    :
              9625772  Tornatzky    The project, University-Industry Technology Transfer in
              Southern  EPSCoR States, will focus on research universities located in eight 
              southern EPSCoR states (Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana,  Mississippi,
              Oklahoma, South Carolina, and West Virginia) in a  region-wide effort to
              upgrade their technology transfer performance  and practices.  Its operating
              premise is that a more robust  technology transfer relationship between EPSCoR
              state universities  and industrial partners will have positive impacts on the 
              fundamental research and educational activities of the  institutions.  The
              project will conduct an outreach effort focused  on EPSCoR-state universities
              that has the following components:   (1) an annual report to the region (e.g.,
              the Southern Governors  Association) on the state of university-industry
              technology  transfer; (2) an annual practitioner/stakeholder conference; (3) a 
              network of "best practitioners" who can provide outreach assistance  to peers
              in EPSCoR-state universities; (4) a continuing analysis of  performance and
              practice benchmarks; (5) accelerated dissemination  of relevant reports,
              guidebooks, and tools; and (6) continued  professional development services for
              faculty.
