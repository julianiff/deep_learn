Abstract    :
              9625406    This work, a collaboration between researchers at Cornell  University
              and  the University of Oklahoma, is focused on developing  understanding about 
              the mechanisms of rock fracture in compression.  The  research involves 
              formulation and testing, with unique experiments and  computer simulation, 
              necessary to identify the evolution rules for the stable  growth of 
              three-dimensional cracks of arbitrary shape in brittle and  rock materials.  A
              laser will be used to induce three-dimensional cracks in  transparent 
              specimens.  These specimens will be tested under compressive  loading to 
              induce stable growth and crack interactions.  With  transparent material, 
              structural instabilities can be easily observed.  Based on  the test  results,
              three-dimensional crack propagation criteria will  be formulated.  An existing
              computer simulator will be applied and extended  for fully  three-dimensional
              crack growth and interaction.  Evolution  rules for crack  growth will be
              programmed into this simulator, which allows  arbitrary  trajectories of single
              internal cracks, cracks interacting  with free  surfaces, and with each other. 
              The hypothesis to be tested  within this  objective is that, using computer
              simulation, an acceptable  rule is one  that will be able not only to reproduce
              experimental  observations, but also  will be able to predict evolving crack
              shapes in additional  proof tests  before performing them.  ***
