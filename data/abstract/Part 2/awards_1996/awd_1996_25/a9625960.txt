Abstract    :
              9625960  Lanford  This award is to develop a compact, broad range magnetic 
              spectrometer to be used in ion beam analysis for materials  research.  This
              spectrometer is designed to be used as a  detector for Rutherford
              backscattering (RBS) wihich will allow  the measurement of RBS spectra with
              equal ease and precision as  current systems, but with more than a factor of
              ten better  energy resolution.  This order of magnitude improvement in  energy
              resolution translates into an order of magnitude  improvement in the near
              surface depth and mass resolution of  RBS.  With this spectrometer, 4HeRBS will
              have mass resolution  better than (i.e. smaller than) 1 amu for all target
              nuclei and  will have a near surface depth resolution approaching atomic 
              dimensions.  One novel feature of this spectrometer is the  ability to measure
              RBS spectra with a large solid angle  centered at 180o where kinematic
              broadening is minimized  (dE/d=0) for all target masses.  An extended focal
              plane allows  the simultaneous measurement of relative intensity of He+ and 
              He++ ions in order to correct for charge fraction effects.    Although designed
              with the needs of RBS as a primary concern,  this spectrometer can also be sued
              as a detector in nuclear  reaction analysis (NRA) and energy recoil detection
              (ERD),  where the high energy resolution will again translate into  dramatic
              improvement in the depth resolution attainable by  these analytic methods.  %%%
                 This instrument is likely to provide substantially improved  capability for
              materials analysis, and will provide training to  students.  He will provide
              important feedback for processing  development and device fabrication.  ***
