Abstract    :
              This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project,  supported in the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program as a  Grant Opportunities for Academic
              Liaison with Industry (GOALI)  activity, combines intellectual and physical
              resources of San  Jose State University (SJSU) and the IBM Almaden Research
              Center  (IBM/ARC) to offer undergraduate students, graduate students, and  high
              school chemistry teachers an integrated research and  education program that
              focusses on the analytical and surface  chemistry of materials.  During the
              tenure of this thirty-six  month standard grant, Professors Pesek and Scharberg
              and nine of  their SJSU colleagues in the Departments of Chemistry, Physics, 
              and Materials Engineering will join with twenty-two of their  counterparts at
              IBM/ARC to jointly mentor a total of twenty-two  undergraduates, graduate
              students, small college faculty, and  high school chemistry teachers as they
              pursue fundamental and  applied research projects in materials chemistry.  Each
              of the  participants will spend time working in laboratories both at SJSU  and
              IBM/ARC, thereby enabling them to gain a perspective on  academic as well as
              industrial research, and how industrial-  academic cooperation can benefit the
              two organizations.  This academic-industrial integrated research and education 
              program builds upon the pioneering work of these organizations  that was
              supported under NSF grant CHE-9300131.  Participants in  this cooperative
              research activity will gain an enhanced  appreciation of basic and applied
              scientific research which  should encourage the students to pursue more
              advanced degrees,  the small college faculty to initiate or more actively
              pursue  projects at their home institutions and thereby share the  excitement
              of research and discovery with their students, and the  high school teachers to
              motivate more of their own students to  consider science as a career.
