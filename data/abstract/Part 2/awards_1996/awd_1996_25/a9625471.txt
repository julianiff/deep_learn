Abstract    :
              The proposed research deals with developing tools for the design of suspended 
              micromechanical systems.  A Schematic design methodology is to be devised which
               complements and builds upon existing design tools, chiefly commercial CAD 
              packages that handle 3D visualization, finite-element analysis, macromodeling
              and  simulation.  The work includes: general design methodology; schematic
              design,  including validation; identifying reusable components; generalized
              component  interface; creating a set of lumped-parameter component models and
              design,  fabrication and test of prototype components.
