Abstract    :
              This research proposes to develop techniques for concurrent optimization of both
               the circuit cell libraries and the fabrication process.  A key advantage of
              the  proposed approach is that it allows both the circuit designer and
              fabrication  process engineer to work towards the common goal of maximizing
              yield, which will  in turn reduce product cost.  A second advantage is that
              through concurrent  engineering, this approach can significantly reduce product
              development time.   Provisions have been made for validating proposed
              techniques in an industrial  setting.  The research component of this proposal
              is also complemented by an  extensive education plan for integrating studies in
              concurrent design into the  undergraduate curriculum.
