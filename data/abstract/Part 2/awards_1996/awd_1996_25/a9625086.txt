Abstract    :
              9625086  Pao  This CAREER project emphasizes research and educational 
              activities related to control of flexible structures.  Specifically, robust and
              rapid control methods for flexible  systems are developed in presence of
              parameter  uncertainties. These methods exploit the notions of input  shaping
              in order to guarantee robustness for systems with  uncertainties in natural
              frequency and damping parameters.  Input shaping methods are used for single
              actuator systems,  for multiple actuator systems, and for integrated plant 
              controller systems. A priority in the development of these  methods is
              computational efficiency and practical  implementability. The applicability of
              these methods span  several types of situations such as disk-drive read/write 
              heads in computers, flexible robots in manufacturing, cranes  in construction
              material handling, and trusses in space  structures. In the educational arena,
              an innovative control  systems software  is developed, a remote  integrated
              design  environment is advanced, and a Matlab/Simulink based  laboratory book
              is designed, which  may be particularly  useful for those institutions where
              the required hardware  equipment may not be available.***
