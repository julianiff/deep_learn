Abstract    :
              9625682  RALEIGH         The University of Hawaii will operate the R/V MOANA
              WAVE in  1996 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded 
              research projects.  The MOANA WAVE is a 210' research vessel owned  by the U.S.
              Navy and operated as a UNOLS vessel in support of  academic research.  The ship
              is scheduled for 174 days of which 116  are in support of NSF-supported
              programs.  One NSF cruise is in the  south Pacific near Samoa, the remaining
              are of short duration out  of Hawaii in support the Hawaii Time Series project.
               In addition  the vessel will support cruises for NOAA, Navy and the State of 
              Hawaii.         The MOANA WAVE is part of the academic fleet used by NSF to 
              support oceanographic research.  Most oceanographic research  requires highly
              specialized equipment that must be permanently  installed on a ship for which
              the ship must be specifically  designed.  This equipment also requires highly
              trained crew members  for maintenance and operation.  These vessels do not
              operate in the  same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, therefore, NSF
               supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically  dedicated to
              oceanographic research that are operated by  universities and research
              institutions around the country.          ***
