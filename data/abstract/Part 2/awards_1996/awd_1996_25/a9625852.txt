Abstract    :
              9625852  Nutt    This micro-indentation machine will be used for measurements 
              of interface properties in composite materials, as well as a  broad range of
              applications in materials research requiring  measurements of mechanical
              properties with high spatial  resolution.  The newly developed instrument
              mounts to an  existing scanning electron microscope (SEM) and capitalizes  on
              the inherent capabilities of the SEM without compromising  conventional
              functions.  A unique feature of the instrument  is the capability to perform
              measurements at high  temperatures (1000oC) with high spatial resolution and
              load  sensitivity, while directly observing the indentation and  failure.  %%% 
              The equipment will be used in studies of interfacial  phenomena occurring in
              composite materials, including  measurements of interface properties and the
              effects of  fiber coatings, mechanical and thermal history, residual  stress
              state, and test temperature.  A broad range of  applications are planned that
              include studies of hardness in  ultra-fine-grained (UFG) metals, interlayer
              adhesion in  components produced by layered object manufacturing (LOM),  and
              the behavior of nanostructured materials and membranes.  The capability of
              performing mechanical tests with high  spatial resolution and load sensitivity
              at temperatures up  to (1000oC) is unprecedented and will lead to increased 
              understanding of the behavior of interfaces and fine-grained  structures, as
              well as localized phenomena occurring at high-  temperature.  ***
