Abstract    :
              9625903  Seidman  The tomographic atom probe (TAP) is a fundamental extension 
              of the atom-probe field-ion microscope (APFIM or simply atom  probe), which
              provides atomic-resolution depth profiling  capability in one dimension.  While
              the TAP yields three-  dimensional (3D) chemical profiles in direct lattice
              space  at a lateral spatial resolution of 0.2-0-5 nm, and a depth  resolution
              equal to the interplanar spacing along the  direction being probed (<0.2-0.3
              nm).  The TAP's principal  features are:  subnanometric 3D images with
              quantitative  compositional information on an atomic scale, multi-impact 
              position sensitive detector (PSD) with 100 anodes that  allows for the
              detection of up to 8ions per field-  evaporation pulse, an average detection
              rate of 1 ion pulse  -1 and a pulse frequency of 100 Hz, a million individual 
              atoms can be collected and analyzed in three hours employing  a modern work
              station, high mass resolution (m/m = 200) with  atomic scale images in direct
              lattice space.  There is no  other instrument with the above unique
              experimental  capabilities of the TAP.    This award provides support for the
              acquisition of a multi-  impact PSD, associated data acquisition electronics, a
              work  station, and an advanced visualization program for creating  3D images
              from the collected data.  This TAP will be part of  a facility that is named
              "The Chicago-Area Consortium for  Atomic-Scale Chemistry"; in addition to
              Northwestern  University, the University of Illinois' Materials Research 
              Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory's Materials  Science Division are
              involved.  %%%  The proposed research centers around problems that require a 
              knowledge of interfacial chemistry on an atomic scale, and  chemical
              information associated with 0.5-2 nm size nuclei  that form in the
              decomposition of alloys of technological  importance.  ***
