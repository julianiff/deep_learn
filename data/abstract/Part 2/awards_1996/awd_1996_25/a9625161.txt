Abstract    :
              9625161  Bayly  This CAREER project emphasizes the integration of education  and
              research in the areas of dynamic system theory and  control. In the education
              plan, insight into nonlinear  systems is enhanced through physical experiments,
               undergraduate and graduate course development, and outreach  activities. The
              research applications deal with two areas:  rotorcraft dynamics, and the
              dynamics of ventricular  fibrillation. Specifically, stabilization of periodic
              orbits  in rotocrafts is investigated providing a theoretical basis  for an
              autopilot that stabilizes underlying unstable or  neutrally stable periodic
              behavior. In the area of dynamics  and control of ventricular fibrillation, an
              experimental  project is carried out in collaboration with a medical team  from
              the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Cardiac  Pace Makers, Inc. Emphases
              is on the development of  quantitative methods to characterize the dynamics of 
              ventricular fibrillation, algorithms to predict and control  nonlinear
              dynamics, and clinical methods to improve regional  capture of ventricular
              fibrillation by pacing stimuli.***
