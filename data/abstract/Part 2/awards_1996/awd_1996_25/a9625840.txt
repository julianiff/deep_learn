Abstract    :
              9625840  Quintana   This research planning grant involves planning for research
              to determine production strategies that minimize hazardous waste generation for
              a particular family of products. The goal is to develop a state-of-the-art
              audit which can be readily utilized by manufacturers to determine the
              production system which minimizes waste for their given production lines. 
              Planning for this research includes (1) an extensive literature search, (2)
              detailed analysis of the Environmental Protection Agency's waste management
              auditing procedures, (3) database development containing manufacturer
              information, products manufactured, hazardous materials and amounts used, (4)
              identification of production systems to be used in the research, (5)
              identification of  possible measures of effectiveness and performance, (6)
              identification of feasible methodologies for grouping product families with
              respect to hazardous materials and manufacturing processes used, (7)
              identification of feasible models that can be used for comparative analyses,
              (8) identification and solicitation of industry and government contacts for
              support and (9) planning for integration of research results into the
              classroom.   Industry is becoming increasingly responsible for mitigating the
              hazardous effects of production on the environment.  It is therefore useful to
              understand the impact of particular production processes on the environment.
              The proximity and availability of a diverse array of modern manufacturing
              facilities - over 350 industrial factories known collectively as the
              maquiladoras -  provide a unique opportunity for the university research team
              to conclusively deduce firm relationships between production system and waste
              generation for specific families of product lines.
