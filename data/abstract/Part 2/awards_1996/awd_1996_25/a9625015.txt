Abstract    :
              Glenn Martyna is supported by a Faculty Early Career Development Award   from
              the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to study the   microscopic
              aspects of chemical reactions in the condensed phase using   theoretical
              methods and high speed computers. The goal of this research   is to exploit and
              test these modern computational modeling methods on   large systems and to
              compare the results with experiment. Reactions in   many different environments
              ranging from surface confined geometries to   bulk solution will be studied. 
              In particular, problems in electron   solvation, chemical reactions in
              solution, and the structure and function   of zeolites will be studied.  The
              education plan will incorporate   portions of Martyna's research as a
              supplement to both a first semester   graduate Statistical Mechanics course and
              a first semester undergraduate   General Chemistry course.   In both cases, the
              visual microscopic nature   of the computer simulations will be used to
              complement the standard   curriculum and increase the student's interest in
              chemistry.  It will soon become possible to study chemical reactions in the
              condensed   phase on a microscopic level using modern theoretical techniques
              and high   speed computers.  Reactivity will be examined in many different  
              environments including surfaces, bulk solvent, in confined geometries   such as
              found in zeolites, and in clusters.  Simulations of the type   being employed
              by Martyna  will ultimately lead to many improvements in   the development and
              manufacturing of new chemical materials.
