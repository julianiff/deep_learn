Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division   of
              NSF,  within the Research in Undergraduate Institutions Program,   Professor
              Scott Gronert will conduct research on gas phase dianions,   using electrospray
              mass spectrometry as the diagnostic instrument, at San   Francisco State
              University.  The gas phase ion community has worked   extensively with
              monoanion reactants, and a problem frequently   encountered is inability to
              detect the neutral products.  This work   offers a solution: use dianions, from
              which the neutral products will   actually be monoanions, not neutrals, and
              thus detectable by mass   spectrometry.  In this way branching ratios between
              nucleophilic   substitution and elimination, for example, become determinable  
              experimentally.  The work will be supported by ab initio computational  
              studies.    Understanding of substitutions and eliminations, well-known
              reactions   familiar to all students of undergraduate organic chemistry, is now
                possible at a very fundamental level.  This work will compare   experimental
              yields and theoretically calculated product yields for   gas-phase reactions of
              these and other types.  The project will involve   4-6 students per year and
              all will be exposed to the interplay between   theory and experiment.
