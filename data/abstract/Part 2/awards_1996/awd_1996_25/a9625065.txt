Abstract    :
              Dr. George Richter-Addo, Department of Chemistry, University of Oklahoma,   is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program   of the
              Chemistry Division under a Faculty Early Career Development Award    for
              studies of nitrosyl- and nitroso-metalloporphyrins.  Nitric oxide is   an
              atmospheric pollutant and it plays an important role in some   biosynthetic
              pathways.  Organic nitroso compounds may play a role as   physiological
              mediators in reactions of nitric oxide.  Metalloporphyrin   complexes will be
              synthesized, and the chemical reactions and modes of   interaction with the
              metal centers will be investigated.  The education   plan is aimed at involving
              undergraduate students in research, designing   laboratory experiments
              involving metalloporphyrin synthesis, and   developing an undergraduate
              bioinorganic course.  The overall goal of this research is to examine the
              reactions of   synthetic analogues of biologically important molecules known as
                metalloporphyrins.  These molecules, which consist of a metal ion  
              surrounded by a ring of nitrogen and carbon atoms, are ubiquitous in  
              biological systems and have been found to react with nitric oxide and its  
              derivatives.  Nitric oxide is an atmospheric pollutant, and organic   nitroso
              compounds are carcinogens found in some food and in cigarette   smoke.  This
              chemistry has the potential to provide a better   understanding of the role of
              the interactions of metalloporphyrins with   nitric oxides in physiological
              systems. The education plan focuses on   undergraduate research and the
              development of new laboratory experiments   and courses which emphasize the
              biological significance of inorganic   chemistry.
