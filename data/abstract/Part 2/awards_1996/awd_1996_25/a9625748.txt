Abstract    :
              Design, dimensioning and control of high-speed telecommunication networks
              requires a thorough understanding of traffic characteristics of various types
              of communication services and the ability to use these characteristics for
              performance assessment.  Teletraffic modeling techniques existing in the
              literature either lead to very large-scale structured Markov chain solution
              problems for which available algorithmic approaches suffer from huge CPU time
              requirements, or to models for which, at this time, there are no pratically
              analytical results for queuing analysis.  The PIs do teletraffic modeling
              consisting of simple, general and systematic algorithms to model building based
              on D-BMAP's (discrete-time Batch Markovian Arrival Process).  The modeling
              process is desired to capture the first and second order statistics of the
              original traffic streams that are known to play the dominant role in
              teletraffic performance. Moreover, the PIs propose parallel algorithms for
              modeling as an alternative to techniques based on serial procedures for
              large-scale nonlinear optimization problems.  Such traffic models when fed into
              single server queues can be analyzed by the paradigm of M/G/1 or G/M/1 type
              Markov chains.  They propose to use matrix sign function based algorithms for
              the associated invariant subspace computation .   These algorithms have high
              convergence rates (unlike the linear convergence rates of existing algorithms),
              they are amenable to parallelization and, therefore, it is now possible to
              efficiently analyze moderately sized M/G/1 and G/M/1 type Markov chains.
