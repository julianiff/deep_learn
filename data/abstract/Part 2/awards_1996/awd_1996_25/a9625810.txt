Abstract    :
              9625810  Dzenis    With this award, the Departments of Engineering Mechanics, 
              Chemical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering of the  University of
              Nebraska-Lincoln, will acquire a shared system  for advanced thermo-mechanical
              studies of materials,  consisting of differential scanning calorimeter, dynamic
               mechanical analyzer and thermo-gravimetric analyzer with  extended
              capabilities.  This system will provide new  research and education
              capabilities currently unavailable in  Nebraska and will be used primarily to
              support research  projects in science and engineering, including, for example 
              Electrospinning of Small Polymer Fibers and their  Applications in Composites;
              Microscale Mechanics of Fractal  Interfaces in Polymer composites;
              Thermo-Mechanics of  Polymers during Crystallization; Shape Recovery and 
              Thermodynamics of Amorphous Polymers Around the Glass-  Transition; High
              Temperature Durability and Oxidation  Resistance of Thin Film Materials under
              Stress;  Molecular/Mechanical Characterization of Curing  Thermosetting Resins,
              as well as in other projects.  %%%  In addition, the equipment will be useful
              in laboratory  courses that include studies on experimental materials  science
              and mechanics of polymers, composites and coatings,  as well as in courses of
              thermoelasticity, viscoelasticity,  and plasticity.  ***
