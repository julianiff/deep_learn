Abstract    :
              The last decade has seen significant growth in university-industry collaboration
              in knowledge and technology transfer.  The purpose of this research is to
              document the extent to which universities and industry mutually benefit from
              their research and transfer collaboration, and at what possible costs.  The
              investigation assumes that the collaboration is fundamentally a `two-way`
              street where the decision for collaboration is a balancing act for the parties.
               The future of collaboration as public policy therefore depends on how it
              benefits both sectors.  Under examination is the hypothesis that, while there
              are substantial benefits, actual or perceived, to both, the nature and extent
              of benefits vary in accordance with the type of collaborative activities
              (nature of technologies or projects), organizational characteristics (e.g.,
              firm size), interaction mechanisms, and the characteristics of the interacting
              individuals.  The study design focuses on the interacting population or
              `interaction sets` as a basic unit of analysis.  It uses mailed survey
              questionnaires, telephone interviews, and selected site visits.  The sample is
              a three-stage sequential strategy -- a pre-survey questionnaire to academic
              department chairs from whom to identify faculty collaborators, moving to a
              selection of faculty collaborators, and finally selecting their industrial
              partners.  Faculty collaborators are sought from biology, chemistry, chemical
              engineering, computer science, materials science and engineering, and
              mechanical engineering.  Interim and final results of the study will be
              presented at appropriate conferences and submitted for publication.  Upon
              request, the data will also be made available to other researchers for further
              analysis and classroom instruction.
