Abstract    :
              9625633  Kuranishi    This project deals with a number of topics in several
              complex variables, exterior differential systems and differential geometry. In
              particular, the investigator plans to pursue the Cauchy-Riemann embedding
              problem, curvature prescription problems, the Radon transform on symmetric
              spaces and its application to isopectral rigidity, and kernels on weakly
              pseudoconvex domains and holomorphc extension problems.    Many problems in
              differential geometry and complex analysis can be couched in the language of
              exterior differential systems - exterior differential systems are a
              generalization of systems of partial differential equations allowing them to be
              defined globally on curved spaces without having to introduce local
              coordinates. Several of the proposed problems deal with applications of
              exterior systems theory. The curvature prescription problem, in particular,
              seeks to find spaces satisfying a given set of curvature properties by solving
              an associated system of exterior equations on a smooth but otherwise bare
              space.
