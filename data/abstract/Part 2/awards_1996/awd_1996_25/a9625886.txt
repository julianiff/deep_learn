Abstract    :
              Abstract  Hennage    A request has been made for funding to help offset the
              costs of travel and registration fees for invited speakers, faculty and student
              presenters in order to attend the 1996 Laser Applications to Chemical and
              Environmental Analysis Topical (LACEA) Meeting, to be held March 20-22, 1996 in
              Orlando, Florida.  This meeting is sponsored by the Optical Society of America
              and will provide a forum which will include topics in new applications of laser
              devices to chemical analysis of the atmosphere and environment, for diagnostics
              of flames, plasmas, and material processing, and to chemical analysis of gas,
              liquid, solid, and biological samples.  LACEA provides a forum not generally
              available at most regular scientific meetings because of its focus on optical
              diagnostics measurement techniques.
