Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Lee of the  
              University of Houston will investigate new and versatile approaches to   the
              preparation of artificial enzymes. The research will focus on the use   of
              alkanethio units to bind a monolayer of cyclodextrin moieties to a   gold
              surface. Further, within the cyclodextrin cavity, additional   alkanethio units
              shall be bonded to the gold surface and used to position   the reactants for
              enhanced catalytic activity. For the education portion   of the investigation,
              the principal investigator will facilitate student   understanding of the
              industrial environment by inviting several lecturers   from the local
              industries to talk in a new course on `Process Chemistry   and Environmental
              Aspects of Petrochemistry`. In addition, a second   course will be added on the
              subject `Chemistry in Context`.  Control of  reaction topology to facilitate a
              desired reaction is the   main goal of many scientists. This award from the
              Organic Dynamics   Program addresses this theme by tethering artificial
              catalytic units to   gold surfaces and using alkanethio units to tune the inner
              catalytic   environment. The education portion of the award will focus on
              preparing   undergraduate and graduate students for their post-graduate careers
              by   introducing two new courses. The first course will teach them how  
              chemistry is involved in the everyday life and is titled, `Chemistry in  
              Context`. For the second course, industrial scientists will be invited to  
              give several lectures and perspectives of industrial careers.
