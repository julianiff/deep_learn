Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT  EEC-9625197    In order to provide the advantages of electronic
              meeting technology to the 55 I/UCRCs, the Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for Information Management has embarked on a project to install
              Group Systems software at the 55 Centers.  The Center for information
              Management envisions that the future Industrial Advisory Board meetings may
              take advantage of video, audio, and data links, supported through Group Systems
              technology, to enable participation by Board members without the need for
              travel from their regular business.  Board members from their desktops, will
              take full part in meetings using these tools.  Future Center Director's
              meetings might also be able to take advantage of this technology to enable
              Center Directors with competing commitments to scamlessly attend and fully
              participate.
