Abstract    :
              9625200  Hu       This CAREER award is to develop methods that reduce variation
              in sheet metal assembly and joining, and an educational plan of curriculum and
              laboratory development.  The technical approach to minimize variations in sheet
              metal assembly will: (1) develop a generic simulation model of the sheet metal
              assembly process that takes into account compliance of the sheet, (2) model the
              resistance welding process so its effects can be included, and (3) develop a
              robust design criterion that can assess the quality of sheet metal assembly
              processes.  The educational plan will team the investigator and his colleagues
              as they develop a unique curriculum for both traditional and non-traditional
              students on automotive assembly engineering.  Mentoring and outreach to
              underrepresented minorities, both through industrial projects and in
              collaboration with Focus:  Hope in Detroit, will be complemented by the
              development of a laboratory for assembly and joining that will be used for
              teaching and research.       The success of this project will generate new
              knowledge and methodologies that produce higher quality sheet metal assemblies.
               This will impact industries such as automotive, aerospace, furniture and
              appliances,  making their products more competitive  because of improved
              quality and lower cost.
