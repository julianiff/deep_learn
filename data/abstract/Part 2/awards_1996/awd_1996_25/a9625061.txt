Abstract    :
              9625061  Duenyas   The research focus of this CAREER award is on new techniques,
              structural results, and approximations for dynamic production control in the
              presence of variability.  The research develops effective control mechanisms in
              three main areas:  batch processing machines, machines with significant setup
              times, and time-constrained ("perishable") processors.  The investigator will
              apply results from semi-Markov decision theory, closed queueing network
              analysis, and stochastic ordering to obtain structural results for small
              problems that guide the development of heuristic techniques for larger
              problems.  The teaching plan includes the development of a new course
              integrating manufacturing processes and planning that will be offered in
              conjunction with a federally-funded educational coalition whose mission is the
              development of manufacturing expertise in a disadvantaged, inner-city
              population.   Production control problems addressed in this research are
              particularly relevant in the manufacture of semiconductor devices and
              flat-panel displays,  both critical industries for U.S. military and economic
              competitiveness.  The investigator will work closely with manufacturers in both
              industries, including a developer of commercial factory planning/scheduling
              software for the flat-panel display industry.  This research has the potential
              to increase both yield and throughput in these manufacturing facilities.
