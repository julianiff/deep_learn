Abstract    :
              9625829  Suzuki  This award provides support for the acquisition of a squid 
              magnetometer for use by the materials scientists in the  departments of
              chemistry and physics on the Binghamton Campus  of the State University of New
              York.  %%%  This instrument enables the characterization of important 
              materials including graphite intercalated compounds and  magnetic glasses, for
              projects sponsored by NSF and DOE as well  as state and industry.    The
              magnetometer will be installed in  a facility under renovation by an NSF STI
              award, which will  house all the materials chemists and physicists, and will be
               available for use by students.  ***
