Abstract    :
                  This project explores a new approach to sequencing by  hybridization (SBH),
              which uses     interaction to  dramatically reduce the number of
              oligonucleotides for de  novo sequencing of large DNA fragments, while
              preserving the  parallelism which is the primary advantage of  SBH.  The  goals
              of the project include: (1) Development of efficient  algorithms for the
              interactive design of sequencing chips;  and (2) Utilization of simulation
              results to establish that  64kb fragments can be sequenced (obtained using 
              approximately ten  rounds of standard-sized 64k oligonucleotide arrays).  The 
              project includes the following theoretical and laboratory  research in
              interactive SBH: (a) In a collaborative effort  with  biochemists at Oxford
              University, England, algorithmic  issues in the design and  manufacture SBH
              arrays, under a variety of fabrication  technologies, are examined; (b)
              Algorithmic issues inherent  in reconstructing DNA sequences from hybridization
               data, under complications such as non-classical chip designs  and
              hybridization errors, are studied; and (c) Algorithmic  issues inherent in
              other novel variations of SBH,  particularly  photolithography-based
              interactive SBH and positional SBH,  are investigated.  This project is jointly
              funded with the  Computational Biological Activity.***
