Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division,  
              Professor Howard E. Zimmerman of the University of Wisconsin - Madison   will
              study  mechanistic fundamentals of organic photochemistry, via   computational
              approaches to understanding of hypersurfaces and   radiationless processes, and
              computationally supported systematic   approaches to solid state
              photochemistry. The project includes   examination of ways to predict the
              ability of alternative transition   structures to fit in reactant crystal
              lattices (i.e. ways to determine   what products are viable in solid state
              photoreactions), studies of   whether barriers on excited hypersurfaces or
              radiationless decay   processes control photoproduct formation in certain
              specific instances,   and a study of polymer matrices as constraints on
              molecular   photochemistry.  The phase in which a chemical reaction is
              conducted - crystal, amorphous   solid, liquid, or gas - can determine the
              outcome of the reaction.   Crystal constraints are frequently very great but
              are not usually readily   predictable.  This work will develop a way of
              prediction of favored   reaction pathways for light-induced reactions in
              crystals using   computational techniques.  Other computational techniques will
              allow   understanding of details of reactions in less constrained environments
