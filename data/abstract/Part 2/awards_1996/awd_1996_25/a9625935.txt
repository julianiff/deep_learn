Abstract    :
                This award supports the participation of two scientists from Uganda and
              Tanzania in an international cooperative research project on paleoclimate
              studies on Lake Victoria, which is part of the core project `IDEAL,` the
              International Decade of the East African Lakes.  The grant provides funds for
              the two scientists to come to the University of Miami to participate in data
              processing and interpretation of the seismic reflection data collected earlier
              in this geophsical experiment.  The U.S. principal investigator is Professor
              Christopher Scholz, Division of Marine Geology and Geophysics at the Rosenstiel
              School of Marine and Atmospheric Science,University of Miami.  The two African
              scientists are Mr. Honey Malinga, a geophysicist with the Uganda Petroleum
              Exploration Department, and Mr. Sebastian Shana, a geologist with the Tanzanian
              Petroleum Development Corporation.  Both scientists participated in field work
              for the project in Africa and are among the core of junior scientists in their
              countries responsible for major operations in their companies.
