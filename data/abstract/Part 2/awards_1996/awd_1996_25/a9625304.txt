Abstract    :
                    9625304  Weng  This project is to study the thermomechanical behavior in
              both  single crystal and polycrystalline versions of shape-memory  alloys
              (SMA).  To make best use of these materials it is  important that their
              behavior be modeled with precision.  Thus  constitutive equations that capture
              the phase transformations  under thermal/mechanical loading, must be used.  The
              phase  transformations are thermoelastic in nature and are therefore  driven by
              the thermodynamic forces of the system which is  inherently a two phase one.  A
              combined theoretical/experimental  program will consider the three dimensional
              martensite-plate  morphology as well as the shear and dilatational components
              of  the transformation strains.  ***
