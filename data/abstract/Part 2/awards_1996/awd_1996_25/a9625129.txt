Abstract    :
              9625129  Cherkaev    A program of research is proposed for structural
              optimization of elastic and   conducting bodies which combines modern
              variational techniques,   homogenization, and new computational methods.  Since
              structural   optimization problems are typically ill-posed as stated, the
              efficiency and   stability of numerical algorithms for these problems depends
              upon   theoretical formulation of a well-posed problem. The expected results  
              include  advances in relaxation of non-convex variational problems,   discovery
              of new microstructures with extremal properties, and developing   effective
              algorithms for highly sensitive problems. The applications include   real-time
              design of practical optimal  structures, such as rotors, cylindrical   shells,
              wheels, domes, etc.  Various efficiency functionals such as the   overall
              stiffness, principal eigenfrequency, weighted deflection, etc. will be  
              examined.   Systematic selection of suboptimal projects will also be  
              considered.    The research involves improving upon and integrating the best
              current   theoretical and computational methods for systematically designing  
              structures with optimal performance characteristics. This permits the  
              reduction of the overall cost of materials, and their weight,  which greatly  
              influences the ultimate cost in aerospace and similar applications.  The  
              theoretical aspect involves understanding the nature of optimal  
              microstruatures, while the computational aspect involves distributing and  
              modifying these composites to best adapt to practical working conditions.   
              The efficiency of both the design methods and the designs themselves   should
              prove advantageous  in industrial applications.
