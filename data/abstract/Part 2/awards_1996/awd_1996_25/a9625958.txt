Abstract    :
              9625958  Reid       One of the fundamental problems in low-dimensional topology
              is   to understand the geometry and topology of 3-dimensional manifolds 
              admitting a complete hyperbolic structure of finite volume.  Of  particular
              interest are properties of incompressible surfaces in  hyperbolic 3-manifolds,
              and interactions between number theory and  algebra on the one hand and
              hyperbolic 3-manifolds on the other.    The former involves the study of the
              existence and construction of   incompressible surfaces in hyperbolic
              3-manifolds, and the latter   concentrates on how certain invariants arising
              from algebraic data   associated to a hyperbolic 3-manifold are related to the
              geometry and   topology of the the 3-manifold.       The study of surfaces in
              3-manifolds plays an important role in  3-dimensional topology.  Indeed, many
              of the deepest results in 3-manifold  topology have arisen from the study of
              how surfaces map into  3-manifolds.  Apart from their application in 3-manifold
              topology, the  study of surfaces in 3-manifolds has had many interesting
              applications  in physics.  The number theoretic connections alluded to above
              have  proved important in recent years in proving theorems about hyperbolic 
              3-manifolds.  One of the simplest number theoretic connections is  through the
              volume of a hyperbolic 3-manifold.  This is closely  connected to the
              Dilogarithm function, which appears in many guises   in other branches of
              mathematics and physics.  ***
