Abstract    :
              9625861  Martin    This award will support the acquisition of a comprehensive 
              dynamic thermal analysis system for materials  characterization.  The system
              will include five (5) modules  for high-sensitivity differential scanning
              colorimeter  (DSC), a high-temperature DSC, a dynamic mechanical analyzer 
              (DMA), a thermal mechanical analyzer (TMA), and a dielectric  thermal analyzer
              (DEA),  controlled through a central multi-  tasking UNIX based computer
              controller.  The combined units  will provide thermal characterization for
              materials not  currently available.  All types of materials, ranging from 
              inorganic chalcogenide glasses to intermetallic compounds to  low-temperature
              glasses, organic polymers, and glass-polymer  melt blends, will be studied. 
              %%%  This instrumentation will add needed capability at Iowa  State University 
              for use in new materials synthesis,  processing, and characterization,
              important for obtaining  information on processing dependent properties, and
              their  chemical and phase purity.
