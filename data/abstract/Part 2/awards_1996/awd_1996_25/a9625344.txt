Abstract    :
              This project continues the investigation of effective  algorithms for some major
              problems of polynomial and matrix  computations.    One of the main subjects of
              the current project is the study  of approximating polynomial zeros, which has
              recently  resulted in the design of new solution algorithms running in  optimal
              time (up to polylog factors). The optimality has  been reached under both
              Boolean and arithmetic and both  sequential and parallel models of computing.
              The project  includes the work on extension of the latter results to  other
              major problems of algebraic and numerical computing,  such as computing
              approximate common divisors of pairs of  univariate polynomials, approximation
              of matrix eigenvalues,  solving systems of polynomial equations, and algebraic 
              optimization problems.    Another major direction of the project is to continue
              and  extend the  work on computations with structured matrices,  which have
              applications to numerous major practical and  theoretical computational
              problems, including the areas of  speech and signal processing, Markovs chains,
              fundamental  algebraic computations with general matrices, and the  solution of
              partial differential and integral equations.  ***
