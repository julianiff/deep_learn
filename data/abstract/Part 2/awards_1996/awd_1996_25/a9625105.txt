Abstract    :
              New technologies such as multimedia, digital libraries, and electronic
              publishing require large databases and powerful query languages.  This project
              investigates a database  management system that supports a meta-query language
              with which users can design their own visual query languages to specify both
              the data to retrieve and the display format.  Theoretical aspects of the
              research address the characterization of classes of visual queries that can be
              evaluated with guaranteed time-complexity by providing a careful design of the
              query evaluation engine.  Practical goals include the implementation of a
              database management system supporting visual queries, the dissemination of
              results using the WWW, and the transfer of technology.  The project has a
              strong educational component, seeking the involvement of graduate and
              undergraduate students and the inclusion of prototypes in the classroom so as
              to reflect the more interactive and visual aspects of today's computer science.
               Visual query languages will be key components of the next generation of
              declarative database interfaces because they take advantage of the user's
              visual perception to convey information efficiently. Their successful
              implementation will provide database systems with  fundamental capabilities not
              currently available.
