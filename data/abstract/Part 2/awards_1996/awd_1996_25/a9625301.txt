Abstract    :
                9625301  Prakash  New discoveries and developments in genetic engineering are
              contributing radically to our knowledge of plants and providing us with
              powerful tools to develop crops with high productivity.  Biotechnology is
              expected to contribute substantially to the U.S. economy.  However, ethnic
              minorities are highly underrepresented in this area of science.  This award
              supports a workshop at Tuskegee University (April 20-22, 1996) on transgenic
              plant research that will provide a forum for students and faculty from minority
              institutions to learn first-hand about the latest research findings from
              leading scientists in plant molecular biology.  The goal is to promote research
              activity in plant molecular biology at minority institutions and provide an
              opportunity for students and faculty to interact and network with established
              plant molecular biologists.  The speakers will talk on the application of
              transgenic plants to study fundamental biology in such areas as plant disease
              and pest resistance, stress tolerance, improvement of food quality and for the
              production of novel compounds such as biodegradable plastics and vaccines.  We
              will also have speakers on ecological, regulatory, ethical, commercial and
              international aspects of transgenic plants.  Administrators from minority
              institutions and federal funding agencies will be invited to participate in a
              panel discussion on research funding opportunities for minority institutions
              and identify strategies to promote minority participation in plant molecular
              biology research at both majority and minority institutions.
