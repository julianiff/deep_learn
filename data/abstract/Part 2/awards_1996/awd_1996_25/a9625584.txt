Abstract    :
              DMS 9625584  S. Lempp, U. Wisconsin  at Madison            This conference will
              take place on March 12-13, 1996, at the close  of the annual Association for
              Symbolic Logic meeting.  Its primary aim is   to communicate recent
              developments in Model Theory to a wide range of   logicians.          The grant
              will be used for  expenses for 9 speakers and 16 graduate  students. The
              student support will be coordinated with funds available via   the ASL.
