Abstract    :
              9625725  Lee    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
              will develop a prototype confidence-estimator module that can be integrated
              with real-world neural-network applications.  Reliability of neural nets is
              affected by (1) input novelty, (2) data consistency, and (3) time-varying
              system dynamics.  Confidence measures can gauge network reliability by
              indicating when a neural network's output should be trusted and when periodic
              retraining should occur in slow time-varying dynamic systems. 
              Confidence-generation algorithms complement virtually all neural nets and can
              help their integration into production environments.  Phase II will address
              confidence algorithms for all reliability factors and a method for scaling and
              combining confidence measures to generate a single probabilistic value. 
              Algorithms will be tested on data from an electrolytic chemical process, metal
              smelting process, a polymer formulation process control, and an artificial
              control optimization problem for supply-chain inventory management.      A
              confidence-estimator module potentially can be used in virtually every
              real-world neural-network solution to improve both the acceptance and
              performance accuracy.  Commercial applications are expected in process control,
              finance, retail, insurance, and imaging.  The confidence-estimator module will
              be useful to 200-300 rapidly expanding companies currently selling
              neural-network-based products.  ***
