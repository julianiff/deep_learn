Abstract    :
                9625216  Povirk  The goals of this CAREER development award are to gain a 
              fundamental understanding of the factors that control film  integrity and to
              identify materials and processes that lead to  reliable and durable
              metallizations.  The proposed research on  thin films and interfacial fracture
              is timely and exciting and  there is a good balance of the experimental and the
              theoretical  work proposed.  The educational plan shows a strong commitment to 
              teaching and outreach activities and leadership potential in  these areas is
              clearly evident.  ***
