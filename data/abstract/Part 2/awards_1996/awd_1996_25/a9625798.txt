Abstract    :
                9625798    This work seeks to integrate two numerical techniques for solution
              of the neutral particle Boltzman equation.  Variational nodal methods, which
              combine a hybrid finite element treatment of the spatial variable with
              spherical harmonics expansions in angle, will be used in conjuction with
              adaptive grid techniques to form a powerful new approach to the simulation. 
              Applications of this technology are anticipated in radiation therapy, radiative
              heat transfer, nuclear fission, and nuclear fusion.
