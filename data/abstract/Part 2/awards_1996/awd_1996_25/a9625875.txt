              Postdoctoral Research Associateships in Experimental Computer Science:
              Processor Allocation in Hierarchical Heterogeneous Networks of Workstations   
              The wide availability and reasonable cost of networks of workstations makes
              them an attractive alternative to traditional supercomputer systems.  However,
              the low degree of uniformity in the execution and communication times of
              parallel applications in heterogeneous systems can impose significant
              constraints on the possible parallel task scheduling solutions.  The primary 
              goals of this work are to develop techniques for determining the appropriate
              number and type of processors to be allocated to each application in a
              heterogeneous network of multiprogrammed workstations, and to match the diverse
              hardware platforms to the computational and communication requirements of the 
              specific application tasks.  The proposed "matching factor," which provides a
              performance indicator for pairing hardware and applications in a dedicated
              environment, will be extended with scheduling heuristics for a network of
              multiprogrammed workstations with heterogeneous processor types and
              interconnection networks.  The highly experimental nature of this work will
              greatly benefit from the interaction with computational scientists and
              engineers working at the University of Minnesota, and from the availability of
              the University's unique hardware and software resources.  ***
