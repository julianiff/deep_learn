Abstract    :
              The proposed study is concerned with a one-step direct process to fabricate 
              three-dimensional parts using a laser beam.  This process is referred to as the
               Laser-Aided Direct Rapid Prototyping (LADRP).  Laser light can melt and/or 
              vaporize virtually any material and laser tooling leads to the unification of 
              various conventional tools because a laser beam can be used to carry out many 
              different machining operations such as cutting, drilling, welding and milling. 
               Such process integration is very important for the rapid production of three- 
              dimensional parts directly in near net shape.    The success of the proposed
              rapid prototyping process depends on the development  of systematic design
              methodologies and developing suitable digital interfaces  between design and
              manufacturing.  The proposed research will carry out  experimental studies and
              develop mathematical models for the LADRP process, and  will develop design
              rule characterization of the LADRP process so that lower-  level CAD tools for
              process planning simulation and verification may be  implemented.  A layered
              description language will be developed that can generate  the slices of 2.5 D
              layers for the part from an input file specified in some  higher level
              description language such as the STL or ACIS format.
