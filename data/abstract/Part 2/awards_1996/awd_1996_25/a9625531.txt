Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop compilation techniques to support
              efficient machine-independent programming of high-performance multiprocessors
              through implementation of COSMIC, the "Communication-Optimizing, Shared-Memory
              Integrated Compiler."  To achieve high performance, COSMIC will apply
              optimizations for locality, synchronization, communication, and memory system
              effects.  COSMIC follows two basic guidelines.  First, it uses compilation
              techniques for message-passing machines to retain most of the benefits of
              explicit messages.  Second, it exploits architectural and operating system
              support available on shared-memory multiprocessors to improve flexibility and
              performance.  A novel characteristic of COSMIC will be its ability to take
              advantage of the multiple coherence protocols and hybrid message-passing
              support found in software Distributed -Shared-Memory (DSM) systems and
              Flexible-Shared-Memory system (FSM) machines.  To evaluate the impact on the
              performance of scientific applications, COSMIC will be tested on programs from
              benchmark suites such as Perfect, NAS, SPEC, and SADIE, as well as
              representative applications (e.g., CHARMM, MOLDYN, DSMC, EULER, NRL Flame) from
              fields such as computational chemistry, computational fluid dynamics, and
              computational combustion.
