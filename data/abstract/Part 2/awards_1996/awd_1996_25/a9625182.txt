Abstract    :
                This project is a collaborative effort to construct the first self- 
              consistent computational model of a substorm by coupling the  physics of the
              inner magnetosphere and the ionosphere (as  represented by the Rice Convection
              Model) and the physics of the  tail (as represented by the Los-Alamos/Goddard
              MHD model of tail  dynamics).  A third element is an equilibrium code that has
              been  developed through a Los Alamos - Goddard - Rice collaboration.  The 
              fully merged Tail-MHD/RCM model is anticipated to be a powerful  tool for
              testing substorm ideas for theoretical consistency and for  making precise
              theoretical predictions that can be compared with  observations.  The project
              has evolved as part of the GEM effort to  develop a modular Global Geospace
              General Circulation Model and  consists of a prototypical coupling of a Core
              Module to a  Tail/Substorm Module.
