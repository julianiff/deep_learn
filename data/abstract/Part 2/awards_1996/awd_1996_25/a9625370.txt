Abstract    :
              9625370  Spivak  Quantum interference phenomena in small size metals and 
              superconductors are going to be studied in this grant.  The  general area is
              better known as mesoscopic physics.  In this  grant the specific projects also
              involve interfacial  phenomena.  There are planned studies of small metallic 
              samples, of  alternating ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic  metallic layers, of
              superconductor-normal metal junctions  and of small superconductors.  All of
              the work will be  carried out using Green function, diagrammatic techniques 
              and procedures developed by the PI and his collaborators.  %%%  Given the
              shrinking  size of the electronic devices, a new  area of physics has
              developed, called mesoscopic physics.  In this area the focus is on quantum
              interference and its  consequences in small metals and superconductors.  The PI
               has been active in studying this subject and is widely  recognized for his
              seminal contributions.  As a continuation  of this program, the present grant
              contains planned  extension of these ideas to situations where interfaces play 
              an important role.  ***
