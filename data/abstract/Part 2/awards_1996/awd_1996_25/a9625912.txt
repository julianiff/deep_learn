Abstract    :
              The proposed work involves the design, analysis, and implementation of serial
              and parallel algorithms for certain eigenvalue and singular value problems.  A
              primary goal of this work is to devise algorithms that are fully accurate and
              stable when implemented in floating point arithmetic.  Because the singular
              value and eigenvalue problems arising in real-life applications are often of
              very large order, a second goal of this work is to develop variants of these
              algorithms that are efficient on distributed-memory MIMD multiprocessors
              without loss of accuracy.  This class of machines provides both the
              computational power and the extensive memory required by large linear algebra
              problems.  The work will proceed in four phases of increasing complexity.  To
              begin, the PI will identify and construct stable building blocks for numerical
              algorithms and software.  For example, they will study the computation of the
              angle between two vectors for use in various kinds of elementary plane
              transformations.  The next phase will be to refine existing algorithms and
              software  to reflect our newest understanding of accuracy and stability issues.
               The PI will be particularly interested in the symmetric eigenproblem and the
              singular value decomposition.  The third phase will be to develop new
              algorithms and provide software for numerical libraries such as LAPACK.  The
              problems of interest include the generalized and the product singular value
              problems, and the cosine-sine decomposition.   The final  phase will be to map
              our algorithms efficiently to distributed-memory multiprocessors while
              balancing the tradeoff between parallelism and numerical stability.
