Abstract    :
              9625616  Yang  This project was submitted to the "Structural Control for 
              Performance, Safety and Hazard Mitigation Research"  competition.  The research
              will be conducted in cooperation  with experts from the Harbin University, PRC,
              and the  objectives of the project are:  to conduct both theoretical  and
              experimental studies for the design of various passive  energy dissipation
              systems based on control theories for  seismic- and wind- excited structures;
              to carry out  theoretical and experimental studies for the development of  a
              new semi-active protective system, referred to as the semi-  active hydraulic
              momentum damper system (SAHMDS); and to  install and test a passive hydraulic
              momentum damper system  (HMDS) in a full scale building in South West China. 
              The  first two tasks will be carried out mainly at Irvine and the  last in PRC
              with both groups working together.  The benefit  of this arrangement is that
              during the last decade some  passive control systems for seismically excited
              civil  structures have been installed and studies by Chinese  experts who can
              share their experiences with the American  counterpart.  These systems will be
              tested for seismic and  wind hazards mitigation.  ***
