Abstract    :
              ***  9625573  Jacob  This project seeks to invent and implement a new model,
              abstraction, and language to provide a formal basis for describing and building
              next-generation user interfaces, which will involve parallel, continuous
              user-computer interactions.  The next generation of emerging user-computer
              interaction styles has been called non-WIMP and is typified by parallel and
              continuous interactions, as seen in virtual reality or virtual environments. 
              The project goal is to develop a model and abstraction that captures the formal
              structure of next-generation dialogues from the point of view of the user and
              the dialogue, rather than from the exigencies of the implementation in the way
              that existing techniques have captured command-based, textual, and event-based
              dialogues.  Most current user interface description languages and software
              systems are based on serial, discrete, event-based interaction.  Most of
              today's examples of non-WIMP interfaces have, of necessity, been designed and
              implemented with event-based models more suited to previous interface styles. 
              Because those models fail to capture continuous, parallel interaction
              explicitly, the interfaces have required considerable ad-hoc, low-level, though
              highly inventive programming approaches.  This work would ultimately be used by
              people who design and build user interfaces in virtual reality and other
              non-WIMP interaction styles.   ***
