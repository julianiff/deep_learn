Abstract    :
              9625601    Vance   This NSF Career Award will fund research into (1) the use of
              virtual reality techniques to improve product design and (2) the implementation
              of active learning techniques in the engineering classroom. Areas of design
              where virtual reality can contribute to the design of better products will be
              identified and appropriate virtual tools will be developed.  In particulars,
              focus of the research will be on the design of spatial mechanisms and
              visualization techniques to advance cross-attribute design of large, complex
              systems.  Results of this research in cross-attribute design will be
              incorporated into a new course in finite element-based optimization.  The
              educational activities focus on searching out and implementing effective
              teaching methods that will improve student learning.  Study groups of
              interested engineering faculty will be formed to learn about active teaching
              strategies.  Several faculty learning groups will be facilitated.     The
              research funded under this award will provide a template for both the
              development of virtual reality applications to improve product design and a
              process to integrate active learning techniques in the engineering classroom. 
              Virtual reality techniques applied to product design will result in the ability
              to design in a fully three-dimensional design space, and result in reducing the
              number of physical prototypes needed before production runs are scheduled. 
              Personnel involved in the design process who are not accustomed to viewing
              three-dimensional models on a computer screen will be able to bring their
              expertise to bear early in the design process because of the advanced
              visualization and interaction capabilities available through the use of virtual
              reality.
