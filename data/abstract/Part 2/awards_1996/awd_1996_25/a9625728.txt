Abstract    :
                Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network, a non-profit organization, has
              been instrumental in  improving the education  of minority groups that have
              been historically undeserved by the nation's educational system.  A successor
              to the Quality Education for Minorities Project, based at Massachusetts
              Institute of Technology, QEM develops effective strategies in the education of
              minority students, focusing on mathematics, science and engineering education, 
              and the issues and barriers that prevent minorities from receiving a quality
              education.  However, in order for institutions to be able to offer competitive
              research and research training programs in the sciences, facilities in which
              these activities are performed must be modernized. This award to QEM will make
              it possible to provide technical assistance to institutions by conducting
              workshops on research facilities.  The goals are to equip institutional teams
              to prepare competitive proposals to the NSF, and to support the process of
              facilities modernization needed to strengthen science, mathematics, and
              engineering programs.  Assistance provided by QEM will furnish institutions
              with the tools required to submit  a successful facilities modernization
              proposal.  Therefore all US institutions will have opportunity to secure funds
              needed to provide state of the art facilities for faculty and students in their
              quest to unravel the challenges  presented by the universe.
