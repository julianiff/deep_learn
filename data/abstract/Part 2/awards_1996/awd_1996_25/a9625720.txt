Abstract    :
              9625720  BROWN         The University of Miami will operate the R/V CALANUS
              during  1996 as a general oceanographic vessels in support of NSF-sponsored 
              research projects.  The R/V ISELIN a 170' general research vessel  owned and
              constructed by the University of Miami is out of service  following a grounding
              in 1994.  The University intends to sale the  vessel.  The  CALANUS is a 68'
              general research vessel owned by the  University of Miami.  The CALANUS is
              scheduled for 87 days in 1996  of which 24 are in support of NSF-sponsored
              research.  The Calanus  will do a series of short cruises of the coast of Miami
              with three  cruises in the Bahamas.         The CALANUS is part of a fleet used
              by NSF to support  oceanographic research.  Most oceanographic research
              requires  highly specialized equipment that must be permanently installed on  a
              ship for which the ship must be specifically designed.  This  equipment also
              requires highly trained crew members for maintenance  and operation.  These
              vessels do not operate in the same manner as  general cargo or fishing vessels,
              therefore NSF supports the  operation of a variety of vessels specifically
              dedicated to  oceanographic research that are operated by universities and 
              research institutions around the country.  ***
