Abstract    :
              9625795  Majda       The investigator continues research on the theory and 
              applications of partial differential equations to problems in  turbulence and
              atmosphere/ocean science.  He uses a combination  of physical modelling,
              asymptotic methods, stochastic techniques,  rigorous mathematical theory, and
              large scale computing to yield  new insight into physical phenomena.  This
              project studies  specific topics in two areas: 1) turbulent reaction diffusion 
              equations, and 2) averaging over fast, random, and statistical  waves in
              geophysical flows.  The work in area 1 involves the  development of new
              stochastic, asymptotic, and computational  methods for studying scaling
              behavior in turbulent diffision and  turbulent reaction diffusion equations
              where the velocity fields  have many spatio-temporal scales.  Potential
              applications to  atmosphere/ocean science are described here, including tracer 
              scale up in the mesoscale and turbulent mixing in marine cloud  topped boundary
              layers.  The work in area 2 involves four  distinct topics regarding
              geophysical flows:  A) averaging over  fast gravity waves and the obstructions
              to balanced dynamics; B)  statistical theories for large scale coherent
              structure and the  Antarctic circumpolar current; C) baroclinic instability and
               geostrophic turbulence; D) parameterization of strong mesoscale  convection
              events in the tropics.  The research in topics C) and  D) involves specific
              collaborations with atmosphere/ocean  scientists at GFDL in Princeton and at
              NCAR in Boulder.       Behaviors of the atmosphere and ocean are complex and
              not  well understood.  This project aims at a better understanding of 
              atmosphere and ocean flows.  Such an understanding could lead to  improved
              predictions of weather, climate, and environmental  phenomena.
