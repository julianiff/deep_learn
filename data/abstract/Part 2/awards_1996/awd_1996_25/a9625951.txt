Abstract    :
              9625951  Flores  This  project  is  funded under the Small Grants for 
              Exploratory  Research  Program  and  involves  the  collection  of  perishable 
              information  on  the  operation,  policy  issues  and  behavioral  response 
              associated with Mexico City's earthquake early  warning  system  (Sistema de
              Alerto Sismico) following the  September  14,  1995 earthquake.  In-depth
              interviews will be conducted with  the  providers  and  users of the earthquake
              early warning  system  in  order  to  establish a detailed understanding of its
              development,  operation  and  deployment. An investigation of  this  experience
               with the world's only publicly available earthquake early warning  system  is 
              needed  to  adequately identify transferable  lessons  which could inform
              decisions regarding the deployment of an early  warning  system  in the U.S.
              and to enhance the understanding  of  human behavior in warning situations.
