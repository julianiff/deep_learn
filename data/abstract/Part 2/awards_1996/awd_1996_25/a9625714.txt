Abstract    :
              9625714  Melrose    The proposed research has to do with various aspects of
              symplectic geometry, spectral theory, pseudo-differential operators and index
              theory. The investigator plans to study the weight multiplicities of group
              representations via symplectic reduction and to examine the K-theory of
              algebras of pseudo-differential operators in compact manifolds with boundaries.
              The link between equivariant corbodism theory for symplectic manifolds and
              orbifolds is to be pursued; the precise structure of the kernel of the solution
              operator to Kohn's del-bar-Neumann problem on strictly pseudoconvex domains is
              to be examined as well.    Many problems in classical mechanics can be
              formulated in the mathematical context of symplectic geometry and systems of
              partial differential equations. In the course of such a formulation one
              recurring problem researchers face is a multitude of different spaces
              associated with families of partial differential equations. In index theory,
              these spaces are distinguished by means of a discrete set of numbers called
              indices, giving a coarse but practical classification of them.
