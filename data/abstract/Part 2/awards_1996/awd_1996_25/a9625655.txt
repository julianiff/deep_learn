Abstract    :
              9625655  Hsu  Partial support is provided for a workshop to examine the  nature,
              properties, and mechanisms of formation of boundary  lubricating films. 
              Experts from a number of different  fields which relate to surface properties,
              surface  reactions, tribochemistry, atomic-scale tribology and  similar areas
              will focus on an interdisciplinary approach to  boundary lubrication film
              studies and suggest fruitful  avenues for future research.  Both academic and
              industrial  researchers will participate as will some industrial 
              practitioners.
