Abstract    :
              9625934  Atkinson    This Americas Program award will support Drs. Larry 
              Atkinson, Arnoldo Valle-Levinson, John Klinck, Eileen  Hofman, and a graduate
              student of the Old Dominion  University, Center for Coastal Physical
              Oceanography, on a  study to initiate systematic studies of the coastal ocean 
              ecosystem of the Chilean Inland Sea (CIS).   Collaborating  with the group will
              be Drs.  Victor Marin and Vivian  Montecino, Universidad de Chile, and
              oceanographers from  other Chilean universities. This collaborative research
              will  be accomplished through extensive use of computer  information servers
              and collaborative software over the  INTERNET network.   Oceanographic
              processes in the CIS  region will be identified using remote sensing data. The 
              data will be analyzed and made available to all users.    The CIS ecosystem
              includes the coastal ocean, interior sea,  fjords and inlets.  Despite its
              ecological importance and  its high biological productivity, it has received
              limited  attention, and few studies have been conducted in the  region.   Red
              tide outbreaks have been reported  which have  caused massive mortalities in
              the salmon farming in the  area.   The study proposed here will constitute one
              of the  steps toward increasing our understanding of the mechanisms  that
              trigger red tide events.  The U.S. researchers will  contribute their expertise
              in physical processes  and  ecosystem modeling in coastal and estuarine regions
               and  scientists from Chile will bring theirs in productivity and  ecological
              issues.  ***
