Abstract    :
              9625552 Ney  ABSTRACT  Research will be carried out in two general areas: large
              deviation theory, and cascade theory.  In large deviation theory, regeneration
              and renewal methods will be used to extend the applicability of sub-additivity
              arguments to Markov additive processes and to infinite memory chains.  This
              yields quick and direct methods to establish existence of a large deviation
              principle.  New techniques for identifying the relevant rate functions will be
              investigated.  Large deviation of the iterates of certain monotone maps related
              to the infinite order chains will be studies by the above methods. 
              Electron-photon cascades will be studied as special cases of multi-type
              branching random walks.  An open question on the balance between electrons and
              photons above a fixed energy at large depths of an absorber will be studied. 
              Large deviation theory is the study of the estimation and approximation of very
              small probabilities.  These arise in the study of transmission errors in
              information communication, in studying large exceedances in random networks, in
              estimating failure probabilities in large systems (e.g. insurance companies)
              and many other settings.  New techniques will be developed and applied to study
              the rate at which these probabilities decrease as the number of observations
              increases.  A second subject to be studied is a model for electron-photon
              cascades, in particular, the ratio of the number of electrons to photons above
              a given energy level.
