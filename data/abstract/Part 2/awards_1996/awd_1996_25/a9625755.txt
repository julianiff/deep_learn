              Planning and Scheduling as Constraint Satisfaction Investigating Fundamental
              Similarities and Differences    This award supports CES Associate David Joslin.
              Although planning and scheduling are closely related fields, the latter has
              enjoyed far greater success in recent years.  Research in the field of
              scheduling has benefited greatly from treating scheduling problems as
              constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs); the application of CSP techniques to
              planning has been more limited, and has tended to be ad hoc.  The Descartes
              algorithm, introduced by Joslin in 1995, has demonstrated that planning
              problems can be transformed into dynamic CSPs, allowing CSP techniques to be
              applied uniformly to all decisions.  The CSP formulation also makes it possible
              to leverage successful scheduling algorithms in the solution of planning
              problems.  The focus of this research is on understanding when and why
              CSP-based scheduling techniques are (or are not) effective when applied to
              planning problems.  In the first phase, an efficient scheduling algorithm is
              integrated with the Descartes planning algorithm.  The resulting hybrid system
              is experimentally evaluated on both planning and scheduling problems.  In the
              second phase, differences between planning and scheduling are characterized in
              terms of a common CSP representation, and these differences are exploited to
              improve the performance of the planning system.  ***
