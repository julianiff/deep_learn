Abstract    :
              9625336  Lipsman       Professors Lipsman and Rosenberg plan to continue their
              respective   work in group representation theory, analysis on homogeneous
              spaces, and   C*-algebraic index theory.  Professor Lipsman will study the
              Fourier   analysis of homogeneous spaces, its relation to invariant
              differential   operators and various orbital constructs, and the notion of
              distributional   Frobenius reciprocity.  Professor Rosenberg will study
              manifolds of positive   scalar curvature, index theory on manifold-like spaces,
              and K-theory and   L-theory of operator algebras.  Professors Lipsman and
              Rosenberg will   jointly study Paley-Wiener Theorems and uncertainty principles
              on Lie groups.       The emphasis of this project will be on the interplay
              between analysis  (for example, study of the solutions of partial differential
              equations) and  geometrical structure, broadly interpreted.  The relationship
              between  analysis and geometry is one of the most important themes in modern  
              mathematics and physics.  Professors Lipsman and Rosenberg will also jointly  
              work to help convey this theme to undergraduates by enhancing the usual 
              multivariable calculus course with computer projects emphasizing the 
              underlying geometrical and physical principles.  ***
