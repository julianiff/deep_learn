Abstract    :
              9625179  Grant    This Americas Program award will fund  a visit  to Santiago, 
              Chile, by Dr. William E. Grant, Texas A&M University,  to  plan a  workshop on
              systems analysis and simulation of  Chilean  ecological systems, with the
              collaboration of Dr.  George-Nascimento, Universidad Catolica de la Santisima 
              Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.  The workshop will bring  together a selected
              team of U.S., Chilean, Argentinean, and  other Southern Cone scientists and
              graduate students with  similar ecological interests, with the objective of 
              developing and evaluating initial simulation models of  several ecological
              systems. to help identify and establish  priorities for specific areas of
              future collaborative  research.  ***
