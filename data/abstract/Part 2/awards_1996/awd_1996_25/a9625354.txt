Abstract    :
              9625354  Levi-Setti    Commercial ceramics that are presently available are 
              generally unsuitable for highly corrosive applications  because they contain
              corrodible glassy grain boundary  phases. Such phases result from the
              commercial use of liquid-  phase sintering additives or from poor control of
              powder  purity and processing. In this project, we are interested  particularly
              in alumina ceramics and their corrosion  properties in hydrogen fluoride (HF)
              ambients, with a view  to developing improved materials of construction in the 
              fluorochemical manufacturing. Corrosion research at DuPont  has led to the
              discovery that a small amount of MgO (0.05%),  a classic solid-solution
              sintering aid, improves the  corrosion rate of alumina in HF, even in the
              presence of  glass-forming impurities. The atomistic mechanism by which  MgO
              functions is not understood, mainly because its  influence on other cation
              impurities is not known. The goal  of the proposed collaboration between the
              University of  Chicago and DuPont is to improve our understanding of the  grain
              boundary chemistry and its effect on corrosion  behavior, with a view to
              designing corrosion-resistant  ceramics.  The approach will be to develop
              fabrication  strategies that eliminate or adjust the nature of glassy  grain
              boundaries.  The distributions of trace dopants and  impurities in a number of
              systematically designed alumina  compositions will be studied by high
              resolution imaging  secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).  %%%  The principal
              focus of this study is to correlate the grain  boundary chemistry of aluminum
              oxide to the corrosion  behavior of the bulk material. This information will
              aid in  the design of commercial ceramic materials that are  resistant to
              corrosion by a variety of materials.  ***
