Abstract    :
              ***  9625820  Porter  This project addresses several important issues regarding
              the  short-term and long-term corrosion and aging characteristics  of fiber
              composite (FC) materials.  These types of materials are excellent candidates
              for rebars  and prestressing tendons in marine environments, and other 
              civilian and military infrastructure uses.  These materials  show great promise
              because they are non-metallic and  therefore are believed to be generally free
              of the corrosive  problems to which steel has been susceptible.  The objectives
              of the research involve examining the load-  carrying and strength loss
              characteristics of a variety of  proposed FC material that have intended
              applications in the  reinforcing bar and prestressing tendon uses FC
              reinforcing  bars and prestressing tendons constructed using long-fiber  glass
              strands and aramid or carbon-fibers embedded in a vinyl  ester or epoxy matrix
              will be examined using analytical  techniques for accelerated aging.  The
              accelerated aging  technique currently used at Iowa State University has shown 
              great  promise in predicting the long-term durability of FC  materials.  This
              research will evaluate the accelerated aging  process itself, the most recent
              and highest-performance  candidate FC materials, and FC-alkaline chemical
              reactions in  general.***
