              scientist  and students from the Naval Postgraduate School, University of 
              California at Santa Cruz, University of California at Santa  Barbara, Hopkins
              Marine Station, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research  Institute and Moss Landing
              Marine Laboratories, all are members of  the Central California Oceanographic
              Cooperative (CENCAL).  In  addition, researchers from Monterey Bay Aquarium,
              Woods Hole  Oceanographic Institution, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 
              Naval Research Lab and Environmental Protection Agency will use the  vessel.   
                 The research vessel is scheduled for 136 operational days in  1996 of which
              47 are in support of NSF programs. The vessels will  be out of service from
              January through March for a major overhaul.  When returning to service the
              POINT SUR will work mainly off the  coast of Mexico.
