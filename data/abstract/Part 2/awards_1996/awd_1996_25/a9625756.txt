              Program:  Robust Haptic Display of Dynamical Virtual Environments            
              This award supports associate Brent R. Gillespie.  To provide for direct
              interaction and to more effectively immerse their users, the designers of
              virtual environments now have the option to render objects for the haptic
              (touch) senses, thanks to the new and flourishing field of haptic interface
              technology.  At present, however, the fidelity of haptic display is limited. 
              Restrictions must be placed on the mechanical impedance of the virtual object
              or exceptional computational power must be demanded of the interface controller
              lest sustained or even unstable vibrations arise between user and virtual
              object.  This postdoctoral research aims to remove these obstacles by
              developing simulation and control methods which guarantee the absence of
              unstable vibrations and other non-physical interactive behaviors.  The research
              begins by noting that the destabilizing effects of sampled-data and
              computational delays can be fully compensated out if the entire coupled
              dynamical system is modeled, including the human limb.  On-line system
              identification of the coupled human limb is integrated into the controller
              design to allow for active behavior on the part of the human.  Concurrent
              theoretical treatments and hardware/software development efforts are employed
              to extend the methods to dynamical objects and objects which are subject to
              changes in kinematic constraint.  ***
