Abstract    :
              9625641  Morgan    This proposal lies in the area of minimal surfaces and more
              generally constant mean curvature surfaces. The investigator plans to use
              methods from geometric measure theory and calibrations along with computer
              simulation. More specifically, the proposed topics include: least perimeter
              partitions of space into equal volumes; minimizing properties of equilibrium
              configurations. There is also an undergraduate research project involving
              double bubbles and minimal clusters - this is done under the Research at
              Undergraduate Institutions Program. The so called Double Bubble Conjecture on
              the least-area way to enclose and separate two regions of equal volume was
              recently given a computer proof, and this is to be further pursued in this
              project.    Minimal surfaces and minimizing clusters arise as physical surfaces
              in a variety of setting as they have certain extremal properties, e.g., surface
              area minimizing and energy minimizing. Smap film and soap bubble surfaces
              provide readily available examples of minimal surfaces and constant mean
              curvature surfaces. Also, minimal clusters and periodic minimal surfaces can be
              used to model compound polymer systems and condensed matter in general.
