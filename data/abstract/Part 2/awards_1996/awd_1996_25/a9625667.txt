Abstract    :
              This research concerns the design and implementation of  tools for interactive
              computer programming. The research  focuses on the creation of tools that
              furnish language-  specific, semantics-based, program manipulation operations. 
              The project investigates both, program slicing and partial  evaluation. In
              particular, the research studies (1) whether  techniques developed for one of
              the operations can be  applied to the other, and (2) whether the two operations
              can  be combined to support more powerful techniques for  manipulating
              programs.  The research focuses on two areas. The first is operations  for
              semantics-based program manipulation. Examples include  program specialization,
              symbolic composition, and program  generalization. The second is static
              analysis of programs.  Research is conducted on static analysis methods needed
              in  carrying out the above operations. Pointer analysis is of  particular
              importance. In both areas the scope of the work  includes development of
              theoretical foundations, algorithm  design, and system implementation. One
              testbed for the ideas  is the prototype C slicer, which currently is capable of
               slicing large (22,000-line) programs.  ***
