Abstract    :
              This research explores systematic design methodologies to handle timing and 
              communication in mixed synchronous - asynchronous designs.  Formal and
              automated  techniques for managing the design process multiple, independently
              synchronized  domains on a VLSI chip are being developed.  Specific research
              focuses on: mixed-  timing design methodologies and components; specification
              formalism for mixed-  timing interfaces, performance driven synthesis and
              technology mapping techniques  for mixed-timing circuits; hierarchical timing
              verification techniques that check  the validity of assumptions used for
              synthesis and technology mapping, and  techniques to estimate and analyze
              system performance.    The PIs research plan is coupled with an education plan.
               It provides: an  environment to nurture students; open-ended problem solving
              skills; incorporated  research activities for undergraduates; opens research
              opportunities to  underrepresented groups; and develops industrial internships
              in the graduate  research program.
