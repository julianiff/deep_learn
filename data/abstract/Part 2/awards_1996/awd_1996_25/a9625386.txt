Abstract    :
              9625386  Moazzami  In most building codes, there are very limited guidelines 
              regarding the proportioning of the shear walls and coupling  beams. 
              Consequently, the response of the coupled wall  assemblies to dynamic loads has
              been noted to fall short of  acceptable ductile behavior.  This project
              discusses some of  the current practices in proportioning and design of coupled
               wall assemblies, highlights some of the shortcomings of these  methods, and
              proposes a new approach that aims at a more  comprehensive design of coupled
              wall assemblies.  In particular the hysteretic response of the coupled wall 
              assemblies will be studied based on a proposed mathematical  model.  The
              primary concern of this study is to assess the  magnitude of cyclic energy
              dissipation, and determine the  balance that must be achieved between strength,
              stiffness,  and ductility capacity of structural members in order to  optimize
              energy dissipation in the system.  The outcome of  this investigation is a set
              of design guidelines for  proportioning structural members for optimum energy 
              dissipation and stable hysteretic response.***
