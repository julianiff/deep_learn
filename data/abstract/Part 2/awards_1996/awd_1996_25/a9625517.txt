Abstract    :
              9625517  London  The goal of this project is to continue studying the behavior
              of lithophile elements in magmatic systems and specifically to investigate
              experimentally the distribution of halogens between halogen-bearing minerals
              and coexisting silicate liquids.  This proposal focuses on the some of the
              chemical parameters controlling the distribution of halogens between silicate
              liquids and biotite, amphibole, apatite, and titanite.  With proper assessment
              of these parameters, these minerals may eventually be able to be used as direct
              monitors of halogen concentrations within evolving magmatic-hydrothermal
              systems.  Such knowledge us of great value in determining the ability of
              halogens to act as fluxes and mineralizers during the formation of
              granite-associated magnetic-hydrothermal ore deposits and, more generally, to
              control other fundamental parameters such as liquid structure, viscosity, and
              density, phase relationships, and diffusion, speciation, and
              liquid/fluid/crystal partitioning of elements.  This is a collaborative project
              involving undergraduate students at Augustana College and researchers at the
              University of Oklahoma.
