Abstract    :
              Constraint databases are a recent generalization of relational databases. 
              Constraint databases have greater flexibility and expressive power than
              relational databases because they allow complete information (unambiguous data)
              to be described implicitly. The project addresses the development and
              implementation of new methods for the (1) representation and querying of
              incomplete information (ambiguous data) in constraint databases, (2) updating
              and revising single constraint databases, and (3) combining and in case of
              conflict arbitrating between or among several constraint databases.  Approaches
              for representing incomplete information will be analyzed for time and space
              efficiency, while update, revision, and arbitration operators will be tested
              for the least change property as expressed by the Katsuno-Mendelzon and related
              axioms. A constraint database query and transformation language allowing both
              representation of incomplete information and update, revision, and arbitration
              operators will be implemented and tested on applications in spatial databases,
              telecommunications, and refinement-based modeling of objects. This project will
              greatly increase the real-life applicability of constraint databases.
