Abstract    :
              9625087  One of the greatest needs of in situ remediation  technologies is the 
              development of systems that will overcome the commonly poor  rates of 
              contaminant extraction from highly sorptive and low  permeability zones.  In 
              most common remediation technology, "pump and treat," fluid  extraction  rates
              are high but the contaminant removal rates are largely  controlled by  the
              relatively slow processes of diffusion and desorption  from  heterogeneous
              zones.  This research is devoted to two of the  most important  heterogeneity
              types:  contaminated clay lenses in a  productive aquifer, and  a sandy layer
              or fractured zone in a relatively impermeable  media.  Two  emerging strategies
              will be investigated:  electroosmotic  enhancements  applied to a clay lens;
              and a novel, safe, abiotic reagent  chemistry that  can be injected into
              fractures and sandy zones.  While the  fundamentals of  each technology are
              well-defined, this work will demonstrate  how the two  technologies can be
              integrated to obtain electroosmotic  enhancement with in  situ abiotic
              degradation.    The chief educational objective is to develop and integrate 
              the common  scientific and engineering fundamentals that are important  for a
              wide array  of geoenvironmental problems.  The PI will develop 
              geoenvironmental  curriculum strategies, broaden the exposure of new research 
              methods, and  work to strengthen the analytical training of students. 
              Collaborations  with industry and government agencies will greatly enhance 
              these  educational and research plans.  ***
