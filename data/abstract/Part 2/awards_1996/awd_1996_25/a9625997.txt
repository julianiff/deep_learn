Abstract    :
              DMS 9625997  Sy D. Friedman      Friedman intends to work in four directions,
              all aimed at an understanding of the structure of the set-theoretic universe
              through the techniques of fine structure and forcing.  First, he intends to
              complete his book, entitled, "Fine Structure and Class Forcing".  Second,
              Friedman will pursue a number of questions in the area of class forcing over L
              through the use of the coding method and his method of iterated class forcing. 
              Third, Friedman intends to lay the foundation for an analogous theory relative
              to K=the core model for a strong cardinal, by first developing an improved fine
              structure theory for this model, and then adapting the coding method to this
              new context.  This work will be carried out jointly with his collaborators
              Jensen, Koepke and Wylie.  Lastly, Friedman will investigate a number of other
              forcing problems, related to 0# (with Velickovic), involving large cardinals
              (with Cummings) and in definability theory (with Bagaria).    Early this
              century, mathematicians developed the system ZFC of axioms for set theory,
              adequate to express and prove the theorems of mathematics.  However ZFC is
              incomplete:  there are statements that can neither be proved nor refuted in
              this theory.  An important task for the set theorist is to uncover new axioms
              to adjoin to ZFC so as to alleviate this incompleteness.  This will provide
              powerful new tools for the working mathematician, which may in addition have
              exciting applications for science in general.  Friedman's work is focused on
              the deepest possible understanding of the structure of models of ZFC, as a way
              of discovering the right axioms to add to this theory.
