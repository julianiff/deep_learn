              Village    This award supports associate Jurgen Koenemann. This project is part
              of an effort to create and study a virtual physics laboratory for middle and
              high school students in a rural area of Southwestern Virginia.  The virtual
              laboratory is implemented as a real-time, multi-user domain, integrated with
              World-Wide Web resources.  The postdoctoral work focuses on two technical
              challenges within this paradigm of network-based collaborative education:   
              (1) supporting the design of virtual laboratory activities and materials by
              teachers, and  (2) evaluating usability and learning outcomes for teachers and
              students.  Regarding (1), a set of software tools will be developed to help
              teachers locate and incorporate World-Wide Web resources into activities they
              design for the virtual laboratory.  For example, the tool will automatically
              generate appropriate hyperlinks and manage simulation software.  Regarding (2),
              an evaluation tool will be developed to facilitate the collection and analysis
              of "critical incident" reports, episodes in which something went very well or
              very badly for the user.  The reports will be linked to portions of the virtual
              laboratory software that may have been implicated in causing the critical
              incident to facilitate diagnosis and redesign.  ***
