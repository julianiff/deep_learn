Abstract    :
              9625122  Weinstein    This project lies in the general area of mathematical
              physics. The investigator aims to apply methods of symplectic and Poisson
              geometry, and Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids, to the study of operators on
              manifolds and more generally quantization problems. More specifically, this
              project will develop microlocal analysis adapted to the Bruhat decomposition of
              generalized flag manifolds, and pursue a proof of an index theorem for Fourier
              integral operators and formulate a theory of Poisson modules, with applications
              to systems of linear partial differential equations.    Symplectic geometry is
              a mathematical tool used to lay a theoretical framework encompassing large
              parts of classical mechanics. Ideas from symplectic geometry and Poisson
              geometry can be used to explain and predict various mechanical phenomena -
              e.g., locomotion generation and motion control - in an elegant manner.
