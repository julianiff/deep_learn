Abstract    :
              9625926  Mann  This project deals with passively minimizing sound radiation 
              from composite structures via the use of embedded material  variations and
              integrated stiffners. An innovative  methodology is developed to investigate
              the sensitivity of  the radiated sound power to material and spatial variations
               so that designs may be optimized to possess minimal  sensitivity to
              fabrication variability. The spatial  variations are envisioned as thickness
              build-ups, which may  additionally serve as structural stiffners. For these
              build-  ups, analytical capabilities are developed to determine the  effective
              stiffness and damping properties for input into a  numerical model. The
              numerical model allows for variations  in material properties over individual
              elements, thus  reducing computational mesh size. Structural beams, designed 
              to reduce sound radiation, are fabricated and tested to  verify modeling
              methodology. The research effort provides a  foundation for designing composite
              structures which exhibit  high stiffness-to-weight and strength-to-weight
              ratios as  well as low sound radiation.***
