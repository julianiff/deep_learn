Abstract    :
              9625320  Shaw   This research develops a new methodology, known as columnwise
              formulation and column generation, for solving combinatorial optimization
              problems.  Combinatorial optimization problems are a very important problem
              class, and include such problems as the traveling salesman problem, the general
              assignment problem, and the capacitated minimum spanning tree problem. 
              Problems in this class are among the most difficult combinatorial problems to
              solve efficiently.  The researcher has identified potential industrial
              partners, including two large telecommunications firms, interested in capacity
              expansion problems in the design of both local access and broad-band networks. 
              Further, the investigator will undertake two innovative educational projects. 
              One is to integrate modern communication tools, such as the World Wide Web,
              into classroom teaching; the other is to enhance the teaching and research
              program in optimization and to develop a computer laboratory for modeling and
              optimization.   The methodology is innovative and has potential for significant
              theoretical advances in efficiently solving difficult combinatorial problems. 
              At the same time, it has promising real-world applications in the design of
              telecommunications networks.
