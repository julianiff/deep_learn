Abstract    :
              This award provides support for the Five Colleges Number Theory  Seminar.  This
              is a regular seminar supported by five colleges in  the New England area. The
              seminar provides a center for the  research efforts of faculty in the five
              colleges who are  specialists in number theory and arithmetic geometry. It also
               serves the undergraduate and graduate students at the five  colleges who are
              interested in number theory and arithmetic  geometry.  This proposal is in the
              general area of number theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the
              study of the whole  numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing with
              the  divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is among the  oldest
              branches of mathematics and  was pursued for many  centuries for purely
              aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last  half century it has become an
              indispensable tool in diverse   applications in areas such as data transmission
              and processing,  and  communication systems.
