Abstract    :
                9625604  Szelenyi    This doctoral dissertation improvement project
              investigates gender relations in a high-tech U.S. multinational corporation in
              New Delhi, India.   Some researchers argue that through the process of
              transferring operations overseas there is a convergence of work structures
              (i.e., corporations exports their labor policies along with their capital and
              techncology) while others argue that there is a divergence process (i.e.,
              organizations are embedded in the social environments in which they are
              situated).  Multinational corporations hire millions of female workers
              throughout the world and these workers have become an integral issue in the
              construction of work relations in the global economy.   This research will
              examine the issue of gender relations in the global workplace by first
              outlining the patterns of gender division of labor that exist in the cultural
              ideologies of the U.S. and India.  Second, it examines the following specific
              questions:  What happens during the confrontation of gender regimes when an
              American corporation sets up operations in India?,  Which country's gender
              regime prevails and how is it formalized in the workplace?  and  What processes
              contribute to its formalization?    In-depth interviews, observation and
              document analysis will be conducted to assess the cultural character of the
              gender division of labor in this multinational corporation as evidenced by
              gender segregation of jobs, social interaction, physical and temporal mobility
              and ideologies governing cross-gender interaction of male and female workers.
