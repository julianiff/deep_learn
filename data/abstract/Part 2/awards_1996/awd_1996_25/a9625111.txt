              Radzihovsky     This  is  a  CAREER  grant  to a young  faculty  member  which 
              combines  research and education.  The theoretical  project  will  address  
              two  major  problems  in  the  phenomenology  of   high  temperature   
              superconductors:   (i)   the    equilibrium    and  nonequilibrium properties
              of the vortex liquid, with the goals of  the derivation of the currently
              assumed hydrodynamic description,  and   elucidation   of  the  vortex  states,
               instabilities   and  dissipation  in the presence of currents parallel to the 
              applied  magnetic field; (ii) the freezing transition of the vortex liquid 
              into  a solid phase, which will consist of the development  of  a  new 
              mean-field description that explicitly shows  the  energetic  tendency  of  the
              vortices to order into a lattice and  which  is  generalizable  to  including
              the effects of  fluctuations.  These  research   efforts  will  be 
              complemented  by  the   educational  component  through new course development,
              and  incorporation  of  students at all levels into research.  %%%     This  is
              a CAREER grant t a young faculty member for a program  which  combines research
              and education.  The theoretical research  will  focus  on the properties of
              unique states of  matter  which  occur  in  the high temperature
              superconductors. The  educational  component  will  focus on course development
              and  integration  of  students at all levels into the research program.
