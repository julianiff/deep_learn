Abstract    :
              9625969  Langdon    This research investigates processing parameters and 
              microstructural characteristics that are associated with  ultrafine grained
              materials, including the influence of  microstructure and concurrent
              microstructural evolution on  the mechanical properties of materials at
              elevated  temperatures.  The research employs a new processing method  equal
              channel angular pressing (ECA) to create  nanocrystalline metal alloys.  Past
              experiments have  established that metallic alloys with ultrafine grain sizes 
              in the nanometer range have the potential for high  ductilities and
              superplastic-like flow at relatively low  temperatures.  The alloy grain
              boundaries are generally in a  nonequilibrium condition and contain a large
              number of  extrinsic dislocations.  ECA provides a capability for  producing
              intense plastic straining that can refine the  metal alloy grain size into the
              nanometer range.  Aluminum  and aluminum-based alloys and copper alloys are
              selected for  the study because this selection allows an evaluation of the 
              role of stacking fault energy and its effects on dislocation  networks and
              grain boundary structure.  %%%  The research could lead to a new processing
              technique for  deformation processing of nanocrystalline materials and  could
              impact future metal alloy processing in the metal  forming industries.  ***
