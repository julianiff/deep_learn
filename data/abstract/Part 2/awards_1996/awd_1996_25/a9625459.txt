Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Proposal: DMS-9625459  PI: Ismail    Ismail plans to investigate
              certain indeterminate moment problems and multivariate analogues of the
              Askey-Wilson operators and polynomials. The Askey-Wilson operators act very
              nicely on theta functions, so it is expected that the multivariate operators
              (the Dunkl operators) will act nicely on higher dimensional theta functions. 
              He also plan to study integral operators whose kernels are Poisson and related
              kernels of q-orthogonal polynomials, their adjoints, spectral properties,
              inversion formulas as well as transform properties.  In addition, Ismail will
              spend some time on the management of the Askey-Bateman Project.    This project
              of this proposal concerns theoretical and computational problems involving
              areas of mathematics called orthogonal polynomials and special functions. It
              has potential applications to random matrix models for conduction and
              insulation in solid state physics, as was demonstrated in earlier published
              research of  Ismail in collaboration with physicists from the University of
              Florida and Imperial College of London. It also deals with asymptotics and bulk
              scaling techniques which approximate efficiently complex systems by picking up
              the bulk contribution of the states of the system with knowing the explicit
              solution. This is particularly useful because in many cases one cannot write
              down the solution explicitly. Ismail's work deals with one and several
              variables so it corresponds to systems with one or several components. He also
              plan to investigate inversion problems of integral transforms, which tell us
              the input needed to reach any specific output.
