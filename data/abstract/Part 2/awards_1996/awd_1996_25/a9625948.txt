Abstract    :
              Computation of transition rates between different protein conformations has
              important applications in protein engineering and structure-based drug design. 
              However, conventional molecular dynamics and transition state theory methods
              are unable to cope with the extremely high dimensionality of most practically
              important problems, even large-scale parallel computing.  To significantly
              improve the efficiency of these computations, the PIs are developing a new
              class of methods that utilizes hierarchical coarse-grained analysis of protein
              potential energy landscapes.  In preliminary tests of low-dimensional (1-12)
              model systems they have shown that this method can improve computational
              efficiency by two orders-of magnitude. They will extend this approach first to
              the computational study of conformational transitions of peptides, and
              subsequently to proteins.  Multiple-level parallelization will be an important
              component of the algorithmic developments required for these extensions. 
              Training will be collaboratively guided by two members of the Cornell Theory
              Center who together can provide instruction both in parallel computing and
              compuational biophysics.
