Abstract    :
              9625553  Spence    This award provides support for the acquisition of an image 
              plate system for quantitative electron microscope imaging  and diffraction. 
              This instrument is a new area detector  system for electrons  which currently
              does not exist in the  USA, and which provides important advantages for
              advanced  electron microscopy and diffraction.  %%%  This new systems will
              improve microanalysis of many  materials, including ferroelectrics, magnetics, 
              semiconductors and multilayers, materials important for use  by the public, as
              well as industry.  It is the only system  of its type in existence in the US.
