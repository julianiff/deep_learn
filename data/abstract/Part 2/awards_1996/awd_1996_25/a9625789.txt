Abstract    :
              9625789  Kapitulnik  This award provides support for a dilution refrigerator 
              system to be used in a series of experiments involving new  materials and model
              systems where low temperatures and  moderate to high magnetic field are
              essential.  %%%  Research Examples include (A) Works in the general field of 
              low-temperature condensed matter physics with an emphasis on  applied
              superconductivity, advanced superconducting  materials, devices and structures,
              the application of  tunneling phenomena, and the use of vapor-deposited 
              artificial structures as model systems for fundamental  studies such as the
              physics of reduced dimensional systems.  The facility will be used to study
              tunneling through  correlated electron systems and the vortex state in layered 
              superconductors.  (B) Works in the fields of  superconductivity, oxide
              materials, layered materials,  magnetism, disordered systems and other
              condensed matter  problems.  The new facility, and in particular the 
              combination of high field and low temperatures, will open  new possibilities in
              pursuing the following projects: (i)  Magnetic phase diagram of high-Tc
              superconductors; (ii)  Magnetic phase diagram of quasi 2-D layered
              superconductors  made of low-Tc materials; (iii) Specific heat of the vortex 
              lattice in artificially fabricated layered superconductors;  (iv) Magnetic
              field anisotropy of the specific heat of  cuprate and other oxide
              superconductors; (v) The  superconductor-insulator transition in two-dimensions
              and  layered superconductors.  ***
