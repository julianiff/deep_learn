Abstract    :
              This is a Faculty Early Career project.  The project will study gas phase  
              protein folding and structure.  The solution tertiary/quaternary   structure of
              proteins is crucial to their activity.  Gas phase proteins   are solvent-free,
              and are structurally defined only by their   intramolecular constraints.  Gas
              phase work thus provides a background   for understanding folding and structure
              in solution, and the present   project will elucidate the roles that
              intramolecular and solvent   interactions play in establishing protein
              structure in solution.  This   work will use ion chromatography, a new
              technique for separating isomers   in the gas phase, combined with electrospray
              mass spectrometry.  The   technique will provide overall shape information
              about the proteins   studied.  Educationally, Dr. Clemmer will teach oral
              communication skills   to graduate students by development of a student-run
              bioanalytical   chemistry seminar series and will mentor minority students
              regularly.  This project will study protein structure in the simplest of
              situations,   the gas phase, and will use the information gained thereby to
              understand   the factors governing their solution structures.  The project will
              teach   effective oral communication to graduate students and Dr. Clemmer will 
               mentor minority students regularly in his research group.
