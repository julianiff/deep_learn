Abstract    :
                    9625685  Salas  In view of several recent severe weather events, such as
              the 1993  Mississippi River floods and the 1995 Rhine River floods, this 
              project will re-examine the design criteria of hydraulic  structures for
              withstanding extreme hydrologic episodes and will  re-evaluate the capacity of
              these structures, such as levees and  spillways, for managing excesses or
              scarcity of water.  The  research project will analyze the concepts and the
              computations  used to determine return periods and risk of failure for complex 
              hydrological processes involving time-dependence nd non-  stationarity.  Both
              extremes of floods and droughts will be  examined including uncertainties of
              estimates.  The stochastic  models to be used will remove these constraints and
              actual data  will be used in the analytical and computer simulation work.  
              Results from this research will make a significant contribution  to the
              management of flood risk and drought episodes.  ***
