Abstract    :
              IRI-9625041       The research goal of this project is to develop intelligent 
              robots that combine cognitive capabilities such as reasoning and  language with
              sophisticated perceptual and motor capabilities in  a natural manner.  The
              project builds on previous work by  extending a real-time visual routine
              processing system to handle  the tracking of multiple deformable objects and
              developing an  agent architecture that provides the ability to pass parameters 
              and represent the world in terms of high-level semantic  constructs as in
              conventional knowledge representation languages  but also retains the
              circuit-level parallelism and reactivity of  behavior-based and connectionist
              systems.  These technologies are  being developed in the context of
              implementing useful  functionality such as message and package delivery, and
              following  high level instructions. The educational goal of this project is  to
              work toward a unified first-year engineering curriculum that  teaches physics
              concepts together with supporting skills in  mathematics and computer science
              and relates these concepts  immediately to engineering practice by allowing
              students to build  intelligent mechatronic devices such as robots.
