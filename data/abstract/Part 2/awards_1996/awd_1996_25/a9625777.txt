Abstract    :
              DMS 9625777  Doksum                  This research addresses the question of how
              intuitive and   concise linear model concepts and techniques can be extended to
                nonparametric settings.  Nonparametric counterparts of such commonly   used
              linear model ideas as regression  coefficients, correlation coefficients,  
              coefficient of determination,  and principal components are considered.    The
              research also studies nonparametric techniques for model diagnostics  that can
              be used for dimensionality reduction and to address the   question of adequacy
              of particular models.  Both asymptotic and finite sample   properties are
              studied, and the problem of developing reliable   data-based methods for
              smoothing parameter selection for functionals and   curves is addressed.   %%% 
                   With the advent of computer data bases of unprecedented size and 
              complexity and with the dramatic increase in computer power, it has   become
              increasingly more desirable and possible to develop more flexible   models,
              concepts, and procedures that can be used to study relationships   between
              variables and to construct models without relying on rigid global  
              assumptions.  Much of  the recent work in statistics have addressed this   need
              for more general and flexible methods.  This research  further extends this
              work with a special focus on procedures that are   counterparts of many
              commonly used linear model concepts and that expose   important features in the
              data using intuitive and familiar ideas.  ***
