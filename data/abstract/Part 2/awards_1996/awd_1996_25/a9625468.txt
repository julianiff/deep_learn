Abstract    :
              CTS-9625468  Wirtz     This is a grant to purchase a controlled-strain rheometer
              with rheo-optical capabilities to study the dynamics of complex fluids.  This
              device is capable of making steady, transient and dynamic measurements. 
              Mechanical measurements will be conducted simultaneously with rheo-optical
              measurements (i.e. dichroism and birefringence).  the rheometer will compliment
              the experimental techniques currently used.  The equipment will be used for a
              broad range of topics that include relating the tunable microstructure with the
              viscoelastic properties of magnetic colloidal suspensions, comparing the
              viscoelastic properties of vesicles as measured by rheometry and light
              scattering techniques and the study of the rheological properties of a wide
              range of fluids including sheared polyelectrolyte solutions, highly strained
              lubricants and surfactant-polymer mixtures.
