Abstract    :
              9625590  Kirk  We propose to measure and analyze device parameters needed to
              optimize the performance of the Biopolar Quantum-Well Resonant-Tunneling
              Transistor (BiQuaRTT) which is on the cutting edge of quantum device research. 
              The applications where this device can be most effectively used are
              low-phase-noise frequency multipliers for wireless communications, central
              adder elements for redundant digit arithmetic processors, and submircon
              magnetic field sensors.  The preparation of this quantum transistor for these
              applications requires a fundamental understanding of the device current-voltage
              (I-V) behavior, as well as benchmark measurements of system performance
              parameters.  The research plan involves a collaboration between the NanoFAB
              Center at Texas A&M University and Texas Instruments, Incorporated.  ***
