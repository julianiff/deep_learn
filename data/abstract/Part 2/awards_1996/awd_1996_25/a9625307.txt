Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9625307    The research focuses on the development of  Holographic
              Particle Velocimetry (HPV).  The understanding of turbulence phenomena is
              currently hampered by the lack of capability to obtain time-resolved full-field
              instantaneous three-dimensional (3-D) flow velocity and vortiaity field data. 
              Holographic Particle Velocimetry is highly promising to provide this
              capability.  Current approaches to HPV focus on the solution of one immediate
              problem (the holographic images vs. speckle noise) and the system configuration
              are becoming increasingly more complex and user-friendly.  The major bottleneck
              in the HPV technique, is the huge quantity of data processing, that has not
              been seriously addressed.   The proposed HPV approach uses two new ideas:  (1)
              band-pass" In-line Recording Off-axis Viewing" holography, which provides both
              excellent signal-to-noise performance and geometric and operational simplicity,
              especially in the pulsed-laser hologram recording process, and (2) hybrid
              optical-digital processing system, characterized by image compression of the
              order of 1011 achieved by massively parallel optical correlation, offering a
              potential for substantial reduction of data processing speed.    Besides
              involving undergraduate students in HPV research, it is planned to introduce
              optics to Mechanical Engineering curriculum including an instructional optics
              laboratory and senior design projects.  New learning methodologies using
              interactive multimedia will be developed for a Fluid Mechanics course.
