Abstract    :
              9625424  Prokop  This award is to support the participation of four graduate 
              students in the Engineering Foundation conference "Bioartificial  Organs:
              Science and Technology" to be held July 21-26, 1996 in  Nashville, Tennessee.  
               The objective of the meeting is to explore current and emerging  approaches to
              the science and technologies associated with  artificial organs and how the
              different fields of investigation  interact. It is expected that new innovative
              and proactive  interactions will develop among the three specialist groups 
              participating in the meeting: materials and polymer scientists;  bioprocess
              engineers; biologists. The young scientists to be  supported by NSF funds will
              have an excellent opportunity to  engage in such interactions.    The results
              of the conference are to be published as a separate  volume in Annals of the
              New York Academy of Sciences, thereby  making the results of the conference
              available to a large  audience.
