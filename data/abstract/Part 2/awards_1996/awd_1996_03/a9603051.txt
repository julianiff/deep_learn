Abstract    :
              9603051  Franklin    This award supports a three-year collaborative research 
              project between Professor Gregg Franklin of Carnegie Mellon  University and
              Professor Kenichi Imai of Kyoto University in  Japan.  The researchers will be
              undertaking studies relating  to nuclei with double strangeness.  Our
              understanding of the  structure of the nucleon and the interactions between 
              nucleons is based on quark-gluon inspired models which, at  this time, include
              a mix of phenomenological inputs.  These  models will be tested and refined by
              extending them into  systems which contain strange-quarks in addition to the
              up-  and down- quarks found in the neutron and proton.    Systems with two
              strange-quarks are particularly  interesting.  They can be created using  beams
              of K- mesons  and identifying reactions which result in an outgoing K+  meson. 
              At present, two suitable beamlines exist in the  world; one at Brookhaven
              National Labs and one in Japan at  the National Laboratory for High Energy
              Physics.  The  operational parameters of the two lines differ considerably. 
              Researchers from both countries will cooperate to maximize  the utilization of
              these two beam lines by targeting  appropriate experiments and sharing
              resources, knowledge,  and manpower.  Through the exchange of ideas and
              technology,  this project will broaden our base of  basic knowledge and 
              promote international understanding and cooperation.  ***
