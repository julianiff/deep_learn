Abstract    :
                This award provides travel support to India for Mr. Schwab, of the Inter-Union
              (IUGG-IUGS) Commission on the Lithosphere/International Lithosphere Program
              Task Group, to participate in three planning meeting with scientists from the
              Indian Institute of Technology, the Indian School of Mines, Banaras Hindu
              University, and Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, for the purpose of
              initiating a project to develop an electronic data base of the earth's upper
              mantle under the Indian subcontinent.  The data base will be linked with
              similar data bases from other regions of the world to construct a
              three-dimensional map, in electronic data base form, of the earth's lithosphere
              and astenosphere.  This activity will result in an important contribution to
              the understanding of geological processes in the earth's upper mantle in and
              among various regions of the world.
