Abstract    :
              9603029  Gilbert    This award supports the participation of American scientists
               in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Tansmutations, Reproducing  Kernels and Methods of
              Modern Complex Analysis to be held in  Newark, Delaware from June 3-8, 1997. 
              The co-organizers are  Professors Robert P. Gilbert of the University of
              Delaware  and Takafumi Murai of the Tokyo Institute of Technology in  Japan. 
              This seminar will bring together leading researchers  to discuss a number of
              topics related to reproducing  kernels, fundamental singularities, other
              function theoretic  methods, and related numerical and symbolic computations. 
              %%%  The field of complex analysis offers practical applications  in the
              solution of various engineering problems, such as  moving boundary problems and
              inverse problems in acoustics.  Participants in this seminar will discuss and
              integrate the  theoretical and practical aspects of the research.  The 
              exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this  field will enable
              U.S. participants to advance their own  work, and will set the stage for future
              collaborative  projects.  ***
