Abstract    :
              9603369  Berkman    This award supports a three year collaborative research 
              project between Professor Paul Berkman of the Ohio State  University and
              Professor Kazuomi Hirakawa of Hokkaido  University in Sapporo, Japan.  This
              project will undertake a  study of Cenozoic environmental variability in
              Antarctic  coastal areas. The relevance of Antarctic coastal areas is  that
              they contain integrated environmental records of the  glaciological,
              geological, chemical and biological  variability around the continent - in the
              transition zone  which reflects the most immediate interaction between the  ice
              sheets, sea level and climate.  The major goals of this  project are:  1)
              develop interdisciplinary approaches which  integrate the biology and chemistry
              of marine macrofossils  in a glacial geomorphological context for the purpose
              of  interpreting Cenozoic ice-sheet, sea-level and climate  impacts; and  2)
              facilitate interactions among Japanese and  American scientists along with
              members of the international  scientific community who are investigating the
              Cenozoic  dynamics between the Antarctic ice sheets, sea level and  climate.   
              To facilitate distribution of the results of this research,  several workshops
              will be held involving researchers from  the United States (Ohio State
              University, the University of  California), and Japan (Hokkaido University,
              Rissho  University, Shimane University, Nagoya University, Shizuoka  University
              and the National Institute of Polar Research).  Understanding the environmental
              dynamics around Antarctica,  which currently contains 90% of the ice on Earth,
              is  necessary for accurately predicting global environmental  changes which may
              occur in the future. The analyses and  cooperation between the Japanese and
              American researchers  will contribute  to our understanding of the role of 
              Antarctica in global change.  ***
