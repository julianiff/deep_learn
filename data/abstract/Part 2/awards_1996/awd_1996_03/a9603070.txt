Abstract    :
                This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in probability
              involves David    Mason and Wenbo Li at the University of Delaware, and Paul
              Deheuvels and Zhan Shi at   the University of Paris VI.  The investigators
              propose to investigate several problems in   the general area of limit theorems
              in probability.  In particular, they will investigate the   sample path
              properties of the multivariate Wiener process by studying the multi-fractal  
              behavior of its increments and obtaining precise estimates of its small
              probabilities. The   project takes advantage of complementary expertise of the
              U.S. and French investigators   in Gaussian and Wiener processes and on the
              path properties of Brownian and iterated   Brownian motion.  The proposal will
              advance fundamental understanding of limit   theorems and their applications to
              other areas of probability.
