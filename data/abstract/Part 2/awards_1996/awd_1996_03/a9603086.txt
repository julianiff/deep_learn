Abstract    :
              Abstract  9603086  Smith             The aim of this investigation is to
              understand the complement system of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus
              purpuratus, an ancient and primitive organism, that may elucidate the origin
              and evolution of the complement cascade in higher vertebrates.   This
              investigator has identified, in the immune cells of this sea urchin, two
              putative complement components.  One is a gene encoding a protein (SpC3) with
              significant similarity to the vertebrate  complement C3, the central component
              of the complement cascades in higher vertebrates, and the other gene codes for
              a protein (SpCR) with similar domains  or functional modules that are
              characteristic of complement receptors or complement regulatory proteins.  The
              research in this proposal is aimed at understanding this complement system. 
              The sequence analysis of SpC3 and SpCr genes will be completed and from this
              the encoded protein sequences deduced.  The expression patterns of these two
              genes in sea urchin cells and tissues will be determined.  Changes in gene and
              protein expression in coelomocytes responding to immune challenges will also be
              examined.  Experiments will be done to see whether SpC3 functions as an opsonin
               and SpCR functions as a complement receptor or a complement regulatory
              protein.    This proposal is designed to address the evolution of deuterostome
              immunity through investigations of the newly identified sea urchin complement
              system.  This system will further our understanding of the mechanisms involved
              in the sea urchin immune response and will help define the primitive functions
              that still operate in higher vertebrates.              ***
