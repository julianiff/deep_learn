Abstract    :
              9603039  Stiglich    This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative 
              project  between Dr. Jacob Stiglich, Materials Modification,  Inc. (MMI),
              Virginia, and Dr. Ramiro Perez Campo,  Universidad Autonoma de Mejico (UNAM),
              Cuernavaca.    They  will conduct research on coatings applied to metallic 
              substrates by a developmental MMI coating procedure called  pulsed electrode
              surfacing (PES), in order to determine its  effectiveness on three environments
              - high stress wear,  corrosion, and oxidation.  MMI will fabricate the 
              experimental coated specimens and the Physics Institute in  UNAM will define
              and conduct the environmental exposure  testing and perform the primary
              characterization of  specimens and will evaluate the effectiveness of the 
              coatings to withstand the test environments.    Wear problems exist in many
              engineering applications  involving machinery and  equipment, but they have not
               received the same detailed attention as corrosion problems.  To solve wear
              problems it is first necessary to identify the  predominant wear mechanisms
              that have contributed to  failure.  MMI believes that PES is an important,
              generic  technology to address and alleviate not only wear, but  corrosion and
              elevated temperature oxidation problems as  well.  ***
