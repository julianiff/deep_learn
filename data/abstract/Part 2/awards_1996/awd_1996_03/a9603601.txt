Abstract    :
              9603601  Frank    Dr. Frank, President of the American Physiological Society,
              has proposed to administer a travel grant program that will enable qualified
              North American scientists to attend the 33rd International Congress of
              Physiological Sciences in St. Petersburg, Russia, June 30-July 5, 1997. The
              travel awards will provide women and minority scientists with an opportunity to
              participate in the Congress. It is also anticipated that there will be an
              exchange of information, ideas and opportunities as well as the ground for the
              development of collaborative interactions between the scientists from the
              various countries.  ***
