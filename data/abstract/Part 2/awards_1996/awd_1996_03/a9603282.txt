Abstract    :
              The proposed research investigates high-tech ceramics based on crystalline
              phases  in the        Si-Al-Y-O-N system.  Better knowledge of their
              thermodynamic  properties could lead to   the synthesis of lower-cost materials
              with better  properties.  This project combines the   expertise of the
              calorimetry group at  Princeton with the materials and processi  ng group in  
              Stuttgart.  The Stuttgart group will synthesize and characterize  samples,
              while the        Princeton group performs high-temperature solution 
              calorimetry to obtain enthalpies of   formation of the crystals.  The data 
              derived will be incorporated into databases and used   to calculate phase 
              equilibria, crystalline paths, and crystal-chemic  al correlations.
