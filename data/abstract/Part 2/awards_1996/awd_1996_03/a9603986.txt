Abstract    :
              Weiss  9603986  The Nineteenth Fungal Genetics Conference, is being held at the
              Asilomar Conference Center at Asilomar, California on March 18-23, 1997. 
              Approximately 540 scientists and students from around the world are expected to
              attend.  The conference focuses on the molecular biology, genetics,
              biochemistry and cell biology of filamentous fungi.  The nineteenth meeting
              will consist of four plenary sessions, four sessions devoted to concurrent
              workshops in specialized areas, three poster sessions, and informal
              discussions.  Topics to be covered in plenary sessions are:  gene regulation
              and metabolism, cell biology and pathogenesis, sexual and asexual development,
              and evolution and population genetics.  Specialized informal concurrent
              workshops are planned to cover:  Agaricus/Basidiomycetes, Aspergillus,
              Fusarium, Neurospora, Biotechnology, Citric Acid Fermentation and Ageing,
              Fungal Genomes, Fungal Melanin and Pathogenesis, Fungal Transposons, Horizontal
              Gene Transfer, Hyphal Growth and Polarity, Medical Mycology, Mycorrhizae,
              Neurospora/Aspergillus Model Systems, Oomycetes, Photobiology, Population
              Genetics, and Self/Non-self Recognition. Strong emphasis is placed on the
              participation of young scientists and students, particularly those from
              underrepresented groups.  The award helps defray the travel and participation
              costs of students, postdoctorals and invited speakers.    Fungi are found
              throughout our environment, and an understanding of their genetics has wide
              applications in biotechnology and agriculture.
