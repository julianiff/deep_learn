Abstract    :
              9603782  Rundle  The work will investigate protein phosphatase 2A isoforms in
              Arabidopsis thaliana.  This family of phosphatases is involved in a number of
              developmental processes in plants and in the sensing and signal transduction of
              environmental cues.  Not much work has been focused on these proteins in plants
              - major emphasis has up to now been given to the corresponding protein kinases.
               The work will utilize conserved regions to amplify the phosphatases, will
              study the genomic organization of family members, characterize transcripts,
              examine their cellular localization, and work towards a protein expression and
              analysis system.  These are long-range goals for this young investigator.  More
              short term objectives include the training of undergraduate students and
              setting up the experimental system.  The PP2A family is receiving more
              attention at the moment in plants because of the pivotal role of the proteins
              in plant environment interactions, making such work timely and worthy of
              systematic investigations.
