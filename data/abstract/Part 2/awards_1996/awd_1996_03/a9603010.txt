Abstract    :
              9603010  Bering    This award supports the participation of American scientists 
              in a U.S.-Japan workshop on Studies of Upper Atmospheric  Physics using Long
              Duration Balloons in the Polar Regions to  be held in Tokyo, Japan in November,
              l997.  The co-  organizers are Professor Edgar Bering of the University of 
              Houston and Dr. Akira Kadokura of the National Institute of  Polar Research in
              Tokyo, Japan.  This seminar will identify  the current major scientific
              questions in the areas of  ionospheric and magnetospheric physics that can best
              be  addressed using stratospheric balloon flights of several  weeks duration. 
              The Polar Patrol Balloon (PPB) program is  one of long duration balloon flights
              that the National  Institute of Polar Research of Japan has conducted for 
              nearly a decade.  Three of these flights have carried an  experiment supplied
              by the U.S. investigator.    Results of the workshop will include a detailed
              review of  possible scientific objectives, instrumentation options and  future
              launch sites.  Coordinated proposals for further  research will be initiated
              and developed. One such priority  might be the preparation and review of a list
              of intervals  of interesting ULF wave activity observed during these  flights. 
              The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese  experts in this field will enable
              U.S. participants to  advance their own work, and will set the stage for future
               collaborative projects.  ***
