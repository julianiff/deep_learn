Abstract    :
              9603234  Bina    This award supports a one year collaborative research  project
              between Professor Craig Bina of Northwestern  University, Professor Fumiko
              Tajima of the University of  Texas in Austin and Dr. Yoshio Fukao of the
              Earthquake  Research Institute at the University of Tokyo in Japan.  This
              project involves a seismological study of the upper  mantle transition  zone
              associated with the Northwestern  Pacific subduction zones.  The major goal of
              this project is  to improve the 3-D images produced by tomographic inversion.  
               The project brings together the efforts of two major  laboratories that have
              constituted different parts of the  process:  the Americans will produce
              thermal and bulk  compositional models for the mantle and subduction zone and 
              the Japanese will correct for residuals and modify the 3-D  travel time
              inversion code to include travel time data for  later arrivals.  The seismic
              structure of the upper mantle  transition zone, from 400-700 km depth is of
              fundamental  importance for understanding the mode of convection within  the
              Earth's mantle.  Improving the 3-D whole mantle  tomographic models will
              provide for better understanding of  this structure.  Through the exchange of
              ideas and  technology, this project will broaden our base of basic  knowledge
              and promote international understanding and  cooperation.
