Abstract    :
              ***  9603361  Goldburg    This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative
              research in condensed matter physics   involves the research groups of Walter
              Goldburg at the University of Pittsburgh and H.   Kellay at the University of
              Bordeaux I.  The award provides travel support and living   expenses to Dr.
              Goldburg, his colleague, X.L. Wu, and a graduate student.  The objective   of
              the research is to investigate the statistical properties of the vorticity
              field in two   dimensional (2D) turbulence flow.  The U.S. investigators bring
              to this collaboration   expertise in turbulence studies.  This is complemented
              by the French experimental effort in   thermodynamics and phase behavior of
              systems.  The collaboration will advance   understanding of two dimensional
              turbulence.  ***
