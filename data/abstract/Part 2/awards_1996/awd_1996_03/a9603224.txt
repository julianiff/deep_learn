Abstract    :
              ***  9603224  Beise      This two-year award for U.S.-France cooperative
              research in nuclear physics involves   Elizabeth Beise and colleagues at the
              University of Maryland, Roland Gilman's group at   Rutgers University, Serge
              Kox of the Institut des Science Nucleaire in Grenoble, and   researchers at the
              Centre d'Etudes Nucleaires in Saclay, France.  The objective of the   research
              is to participate in an experiment to measure the electromagnetic structure of
              the   deuteron at CEBAF, the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility in
              Newport   News, Virginia.  They propose to conduct data analysis following the
              completion of the   experiment.  The collaboration takes advantage of the
              complementary expertise of U.S.   and French experimentalists.  ***
