Abstract    :
              9603171  Stanley    This award will support a research workshop on the geology 
              of Sonora, Mexico organized by Dr. George Stanley of the  University of Montana
              and Dr. Carlos Gonzalez-Leon of the  Instituto de Geologia of the National
              University of Mexico.  The workshop will target topics that have important 
              scientific significance to the resolution of stratigraphic  and tectonic
              problems in the United States and Mexico by  bringing together a group of
              Mexican and U.S. researchers  who share common interests in the geology of
              western Sonora.    Geologic units of principal focus for this workshop are the 
              Triassic Antimonio Formation, the Permian Monos Formation  and the Triassic
              Barranca Group.  Subjects of interest  directly related to these units include
              stratigraphic and  regional correlations, sedimentology, tectonic and magmatic 
              evolution (including adjacent tectono-stratigraphic  terranes), paleogeographic
              settings and relationships  (including paleontologic and paleomagnetic
              research). During  six days of discussions and field trips, specialists will 
              help unravel some complex problems of Sonoran geology.  Interactions between
              Mexican and U.S. participants are  expected to be a catalyst for future
              cooperative endeavors.  ***
