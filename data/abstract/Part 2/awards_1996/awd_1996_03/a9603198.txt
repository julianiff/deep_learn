Abstract    :
              9603198  Falke          This international conference will focus on the
              molecular mechanisms of sensing and movement in simple bacterial systems.  The
              format of the meeting is designed to foster extensive discussions of recent
              developments and ideas among researchers  from the U.S. and abroad. 
              Approximately  60 oral presentations and 150 posters will be included in the
              program, allowing  all laboratories working in this field to present their key
              findings.  Scientific sessions will compare and contrast the sensory and
              locomotor systems of a variety of prokaryotes  focusing on each step in their
              signal transduction pathways:  transmembrane signaling, signal transduction by
              intracellular  cascades, sensory control of cellular motility and gene
              expression, and the mechanics of cell motility.  In previous years this meeting
              has provided an important forum for emerging concepts concerning bacterial
              sensing and motility, and has presented the first molecular details of the
              structure and function of a family of signaling proteins that are pervasive in
              prokaryotic organisms and are now found in eukaryotic cells as well.    ***
