Abstract    :
              9603709  Wightman    Dr. Bruce Wightman studies the mechanism of axon guidance
              in the developing nervous system.  During the development of an animal, nerves
              get formed by the growth of axons.  In order for the nervous system to function
              properly, these axons must "wire up" properly.  This means that axons must have
              a mechanism for determining direction.  They must be able to select one
              particular route over another.  We have employed a moleculargenetic approach to
              identify two genes, fax-1 and unc-20, that are required foraxons to follow the
              correct route during development of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. 
              Therefore, these genes may function as molecular "signs" that provide
              navigational information to growing axons.  We are using molecular and genetic
              techniques to clone these two genes and determine how they provide directions
              to growing axons.  An understanding of the mechanism of axon guidance will help
              us understand how nerve wiring occurs, and thus provide a clearer view of the
              biological basis of behavior.
