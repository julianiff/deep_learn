Abstract    :
              9603048  Tsunoda    This award supports a two year collaborative research 
              project between Dr. Roland Tsunoda of Stanford Research  Institute (SRI)
              International and Professor Shoichiro Fukao  of Kyoto University in Tokyo.  The
              focus of this project is  a study of the low-latitude ionosphere.  The major
              goals of  this project are:  1) to initiate discussion among  scientists from
              Japan and the western Pacific region; and  (2) to develop a cooperative plan
              that will lead to the  establishment of a chain of ionospheric monitoring
              stations  that will extend from Taiwan in the northern hemisphere,  through the
              Philippines and eastern Malaysia, and into  Indonesia in the southern
              hemisphere.    Cooperative research with scientists from developing  countries
              il the western Pacific region is expected to have  important mutual benefits. 
              For scientists from developed  countries, the monitoring stations will provide
              unique and  important measurements, which can be used to address some of  the
              outstanding questions that remain in low-latitude  ionospheric physics.  An
              additional benefit will be the  local support provided by scientists from those
              regions in  the operation of the monitoring stations.  Scientists from  the
              developing countries will benefit from establishment of  important research
              facilities in their region and the  availability of data from the monitoring
              stations.  Through  the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will 
              broaden our base of knowledge and promote international  understanding and
              cooperation.  ***
