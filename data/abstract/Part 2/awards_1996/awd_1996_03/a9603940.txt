Abstract    :
                  Griffin     9603940       Photosynthesis and respiration by plants are two
              biological processes  that transfer CO into and out of   year, respectively),
              and substantially greater than the annual net             increment to the
              atmosphere from   human activities such as fossil fuel burrung and
              deforestation             (approximately 3.2 billion metric tons per   year,
              combined). The resulting changes in atmospheric CO2 can             feedback
              and change the rate at which   plants exchange carbon with the atmosphere. As
              such, the rate and/or             extent of future changes in   greenhouse gas
              emissions are influenced by this feedback loop             between plants and
              the atmosphere.   long-term effects on plant respiration, it is still
              fundamentally             unclear why it does. Accordingly the goal   effects
              the rate of plant respiration, thereby providing a more             substantial
              capacity to predict how CO   earth~s atmosphere in the 21~ century.
