Abstract    :
              9603173  Trenary    This award supports a three-year collaborative research 
              project between Professor Michael Trenary of the University  of Illinois at
              Chicago (UIC) and Dr. Takaho Tanaka of the  National Institute for Research in
              Inorganic Materials  (NIRIM) in Tsukuba, Japan.  The researchers will undertake
               experimental studies of the structure and chemistry of  single crystal
              surfaces of metal borides.  An essential  component of the surface science
              studies of the boron-rich  solids is the use of large single crystals of these 
              materials.  These crystals were developed at NIRIM and both  researchers are
              using them in their experiments.    The proposal brings together the efforts of
              two major  laboratories that have constituted different parts of the  process: 
              The UIC surface science studies make use of the  techniques of low energy
              electron diffraction (LEED),  scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray
              photoelectron  spectroscopy (XPS), and reflection absorption infrared 
              spectroscopy (RAIRS).  The NIRIM group has provided the cut  and polished
              single crystal samples of yttrium boride,  hafnium diboride and lanthanum
              hexaboride.  The researchers  also plan to initiate joint publications and
              identify  ongoing experiments. Through the exchange of ideas and  technology,
              this project will broaden our base of basic  knowledge and promote
              international understanding and  cooperation.  ***
