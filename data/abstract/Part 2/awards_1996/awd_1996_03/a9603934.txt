Abstract    :
                      Ultsch      9603934        Reptiles and amphibians (herps) in the
              northern portions  of their ranges in      North America may spend as much as
              half of their lives  hibernating. Aquatic      harps avoid freezing by
              hibernating underwater, but they  then must switch from      aerial to aquatic
              respiration, with its attendant  physiological challenges. However,      there
              have been no detailed physiological/ecological  studies of naturally     
              hibernating aquatic herps, and only two species, both  turtles, have been
              studied      extensively during simulated hibernation in the  laboratory. We
              propose to study      hibernation and overwintering in northern herps, 
              starting by expanding our      previous studies on turtles to include new
              species and  field work.      The field physiology and behavior of naturally 
              hibernating painted turtles,      map turtles, soflshelled turtles, and
              snapping turtles  from known northern      populations in New England will be
              studied by  radiotelemetric tracking.      Concurrently, laboratory studies of
              physiological  responses to simulated      hibernation will be conducted with
              all 4 species from  northern populations. Data      should allow
              generalizations about  physiological/ecological strategies concerning      this
              major portion of the life cycle of freshwater  turtles, lay the groundwork for 
                  future studies of other harps, suggest general  strategies among herps for 
                  overwintering, and provide information important to  conservation efforts.
