Abstract    :
              9603168  Zook  Dr. Zook is an expert in the biochemistry of plant secondary
              product metabolism with special focus on sesquiterpene metabolism.  The
              importance of this pathway as the main producer of plant defense molecules has
              propelled the biochemical understanding of the enzymes in the pathway to the
              forefront of plant/pathogen interaction biochemistry.    The proposal is about
              a well-planned antisense strategy with which defined phytoalexins, products of
              sesquiterpene synthesis, or the entire pathway, are eliminated by antisense
              technology.  Additionally, synthesis will be enhanced by over-expression.  The
              model organism is potato and the analysis of plants will include measurements
              at the gene expression, biochemical and physiological levels.  It can be
              expected that the work produces fundamental knowledge about the importance or
              absolute essentiality of phyoalexins and will provide information of
              fundamental importance for our understanding of plant/pathogen interaction and
              how to manipulate such interaction in the future.
