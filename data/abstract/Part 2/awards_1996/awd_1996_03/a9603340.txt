Abstract    :
              9603340  Dores    This award supports the participation of American scientists 
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar on the Molecular Ancestry of  Vertebrate Polypeptide
              Hormones and Neuropeptides, to be  held in Tokyo, Japan from November 23-24,
              1997.  The co-  organizers are Professors Robert M. Dores of the University  of
              Denver and Hiroshi Kawauchi of Kitasato University in  Japan.  This seminar
              will bring together morphological,  biochemical and molecular comparative fish
              endocrinologists  to examine the origins of endocrine mechanisms in a variety 
              of fish.  Presentations will focus on two major endocrine  systems:  the
              hypothalamus/pituitary axis, and the endocrine  pancreas.    There are several
              comparative molecular endocrine  laboratories active in the United States and
              Japan.  This  seminar will bring together experts from those laboratories  at a
              time when new molecular techniques and large protein  and gene data sets offer
              potential for significant research  advances.  Coordination with and engagement
              of the Japanese  researchers will enable U.S. scientists to advance their own 
              efforts to better understand the endocrine system.  Information from the
              seminar will be disseminated through  review articles to be published in the
              journal, General and  Comparative Endocrinology.  ***
