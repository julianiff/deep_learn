Abstract    :
              Aguilera  9603905    An enzyme which is thought to be involved in the
              lymphocyte-specific process of immunoglobulin isotype-class switch
              recombination has been identified and partially purified. The enzyme
              preferentially cleaves tgggg and tgagc switch repeat motifs commonly found at
              switch recombination breakpoints. The enzyme activity has been purified to near
              homogeneity from nuclear extracts of murine b lymphocytes and bovine
              splenocytes. Preliminary biochemical characterization with the purified enzyme,
              now called endo-sr, support the initial assumption  that the enzyme is novel.
              The biochemical characterization will be continued in the search for data to
              validate the hypothesis that this enzyme is a putative switch endonuclease
              activity. To that end, work will be initiated to clone the gene based upon the
              information gained by determining the peptide composition of the purified
              enzyme.    Further characterization of the various factors, including the
              involved enzyme(s), implicated in somatic DNA rearrangements in lymphocytes
              should lead to a better understanding of not only the ig switch recombination
              process but also the underlying mechanisms of somatic DNA recombination in
              mammalian cells.
