Abstract    :
              IBN-9603184  PI:  King     An important part of the brain that contains sensory
              pathways to higher centers is called the brainstem.  In this region there are
              many distinct clusters of cells, called nuclei, that process and relay
              information brought to them by nerve fibers from the sense organs.  One nucleus
              important for handling taste information is called the nucleus of the solitary
              tract (or NTS).  The projections of nerve cells of this nucleus from left and
              right sides have been believed to continue without crossing the midline, but
              new data suggest that there may be a significant bilateral projection to a
              higher relay nucleus.  This project uses anatomical tracing and
              immunocytochemical techniques to clarify those projections.     Results will
              have an impact on our understanding of this important nucleus for taste
              processing.  This research at an undergraduate institution (RUI) also will have
              a substantial impact on giving undergraduate students and excellent experience
              participating in a significant research project.
