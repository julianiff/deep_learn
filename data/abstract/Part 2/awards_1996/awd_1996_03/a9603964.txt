Abstract    :
              PI:  Land  IBN  9603964    A central question in development of the brain is how
              precise sets of functional connections are made between particular groups of
              nerve cells.  Model systems to study this question often involve a well-defined
              sensory organ and the target areas in the cortex of the brain that receive the
              sensory signals.  The development of correct central connections and of normal
              sensitivity by central neurons both often depend on normal sensory experience
              during development; with deprivation, there often are physiological and
              biochemical changes in the target neurons in sensory cortex.  This study uses
              the tactile whiskers of rodents and their characteristic "barrel fields" of
              target nerve cells in the cortex as a model, because the system has a clear
              anatomical organization that facilitates comparisons between the normal and
              deprived conditions.  The whiskers are easily trimmed at different times to
              provide a painless and easily reversible form of sensory deprivation in a local
              area.  Physiological, biochemical and anatomical techniques will be used to
              investigate the effects of deprivation on a particular type of excitatory nerve
              terminals in developing barrel fields.  Results from this model system will be
              relevant to understanding how specific sets of connections between chemically
              defined neurons are established during development, and how activity levels in
              these neurons affect their development.  The results will have an important
              impact on sensory neuroscience as well as developmental neuroscience.
