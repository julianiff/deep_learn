Abstract    :
              9603063  Speed      This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative 
              research project between Dr. Robert C. Speed, Northwestern  University,
              Evanston, Illinois and Dr. L. H. Barber, Chief  Geologist, Barbados Ministry of
              Finance.  They will study  the tectonics of the emergence of Barbados island,
              the  subsidence of the adjacent Eastern Barbados Basin, and the  development of
              the steep, high scarp between them.  Through  field work, isotopic dating and
              other analyses, the  researchers aim  to expand and test new observations on
              the  late Pleistocene emergence history of Barbados; study the  relation of
              such emergence to basement deformation; and  demonstrate major differences in
              late Pleistocene of the  southwestern Barbados and those of the eastern and
              northern  region.    The outcomes of this study are anticipated to improve the 
              global understanding of inner forearcs and the wide-ranging  effects of
              sea-level oscillations on islands, and to provide  the Barbadian community with
              a more informed base for  planning for hazards conservation.  ***
