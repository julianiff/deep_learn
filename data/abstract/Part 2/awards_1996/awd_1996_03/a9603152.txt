Abstract    :
              9603152  Turgeon  The work on phloem loading departs from the hypothesis that
              loading of sugars is not universal, but that different mechanisms exist through
              which sucrose is translocated from the companion cells to the phloem vessels
              (sieve elements).  The loading process involving stachyose and raffinose will
              be analyzed in more detail in the proposed work to obtain a clear picture about
              the functions of phlasmodesmata in loading, the contribution of the
              raffinose-series of sugars to translocation, and on actual sugar concentrations
              in neighboring cells.  The demonstration that phloem loading does not occur, as
              it was dogmatically assumed for many years, will considerably influence
              research in basic plant physiology and in applied areas of breeding for
              increased crop productivity.
