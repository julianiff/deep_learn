Abstract    :
              9603089  Wen    This award supports the participation of American 
              scientists/engineers in a U.S.- Japan seminar on  Infrastructural and
              Environmental Risk Assessment and  Rehabilitation to be held in Kyoto, Japan
              from November 22-  23, l997.  The co-organizers are Professors Y. K. Wen of the
               University of Illinois and Jun Kanda of the University of  Tokyo in Japan. 
              The seminar will address theme topics on  environmental loads, environmental
              hazards, risk assessment,  infrastructure retrofit and inspection.    The
              emphasis will be focused on bridging the gap between  analytical and numerical
              methods and practical applications  to civil infrastructrural systems under
              natural and man-made  technical hazards by stochastic simulation. 
              Environmental  problems due to pollution will also be considered.  The 
              exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in the  field will enable U.S.
              participants to advance their own  work, and will set the stage for future
              collaborative  projects.  The workshop proceedings will be prepared, 
              published, and distributed to industries, government and  academic
              institutions.  ***
