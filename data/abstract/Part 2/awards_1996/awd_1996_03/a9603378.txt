Abstract    :
                This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in
              astrophysics between   the NSF Science and Technology (STC) for Particle
              Astrophysics at the University of   California, Berkeley, and the Laboratoire
              de Physique Corpusculaire at the College de   France.  The U.S. and French
              research teams are led by Bernard Sadoulet, Director of the   STC at Berkeley,
              and Yannick Giraud-Heraud, leader of the French group.  Specifically,   support
              will be provided to advanced U.S. graduate students and postdoctoral
              researchers   affiliated with the Berkeley STC for their travel to France.   
              The U.S. and French teams will focus on the fundamental problem of dark matter,
              a topic   identified as the highest priority in astrophysics research. 
              Evidence indicates that 90% or   more of the Universe is made of dark matter,
              and that this matter may be in the form of   particles dating back to the
              beginning of the Universe.  The study of the dark matter   problem has
              important implications for understanding the origin of the Universe and the  
              fundamental nature of matter.  In this project, the U.S. and French teams will
              perform   experimental searches for dark matter either in the form of weakly
              interactive particles or   in the form of massive astrophysical compact halo
              objects.
