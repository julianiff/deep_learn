Abstract    :
              9603310  Foster    This award supports a three-year collaborative research 
              project between Professor Douglas Foster, University of  Michigan at Ann Arbor
              and Professor Kei-ichiro Maeda, Nagoya  University in Japan.  The researchers
              will undertake studies  of the metabolic control of the reproductive system by
              the  brain: signals, sensors and pathways.  The goal of the  project is to
              unravel how metabolic signals reflecting  energy state are sensed centrally or
              peripherally and routed  through neural pathways in the brain to regulate the 
              specialized neurons which secrete gonadotropin-releasing  hormone, the
              neuropeptide that controls the entire  reproductive system.    This
              collaborative research is being driven by fundamental  questions relating to
              nutrition, growth, and reproductive  activity. The research may lead to
              determination of the  sensors and pathways by which glucose and Leptin regulate
               gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion during development  and adulthood. 
              Through the exchange of ideas and  technology, this project will broaden our
              base of basic  knowledge and promote international understanding and 
              cooperation.  ***
