Abstract    :
              9603016  Kuhr    This award supports the participation of American scientists 
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Pesticides and the Future:  Minimizing Chronic
              Exposure of Humans and the Environment,  to be held in Chiba, Japan from May
              26-30, 1997.  The co-  organizers are Professors Ronald J. Kuhr of North
              Carolina  State University and Naoki Motoyoma of Chiba University in  Japan. 
              This seminar will address a broad range of issues  related to pesticides,
              including pesticide epidemiology, new  modes of action to minimize nontarget
              exposure,  bioremediation of contaminated areas, molecular biology of  the
              modes of action and detoxication of pesticides, and the  dynamics of pesticide
              movement in the environment.  %%%  Although efforts continue toward reduction
              or elimination of  pesticide chemicals in the management of pests in 
              agriculture, public health and the urban arena, chemicals  will continue to be
              one of the main weapons in control of  insects, weeds, nematodes, and plant
              diseases for some time  to come.  Information on the chronic effects from
              exposure  to pesticide residues is limited.  This seminar will address  both
              practical issues related to pesticide use and  fundamental questions related to
              metabolic pathways and  ecosystem dynamics.  The exchange of ideas and data
              with  Japanese experts in this field will enable the U.S.  scientists to
              advance their own work, and will set the stage  for future collaborative
              projects.  The seminar proceedings  are expected to be published as a book.
