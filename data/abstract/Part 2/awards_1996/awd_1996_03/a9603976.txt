Abstract    :
              9603976  Truman    To be adaptive, an animal's behavior must change depending 
              on the organism's physiological and developmental state.  The behavior is
              typically organized in stereotyped sequences  that progress through discrete
              behavioral phases each  characterized by its suite of motor acts. 
              Neuropeptides,  small protein-like substances that are released into the  blood
              or locally within the nervous system, are thought to  play important roles in
              inducing and maintaining such  behavioral phases.  Using a relatively simple
              invertebrate  system, Dr. Truman is examining how specific behaviors are 
              controlled by these peptide modulators.  He has proposed a  model in which each
              behavioral phase is controlled by a  different neuromodulator.  Employing a
              variety of  electrophysiological, neurochemical, and molecular and  genetic
              techniques with a combination of in vitro and in  vivo analyses, Dr. Truman
              will examine whether a hierarchy  of neuroendocrine interactions is then
              responsible for the  progression through a specific behavioral sequence.  He
              will  determine whether the basic organization of this cascade is  that the
              hormone modulator directing the behavior for one  phase also acts on the
              neuroendocrine cells that contain the  neuromodulator for the next phase.   The
              results from this  comprehensive series of studies will provide new knowledge 
              on the role of neuropeptides in the functioning of the  nervous system and the
              mechanisms used by peptides to alter  behavior.  This fundamental research may
              also serve as the  foundation for the development and application of practical 
              procedures in controlling agricultural and medical insect  pests.
