Abstract    :
                   Many sensory organs receive information back from the brain by a nerve  
              supply called efferent innervation, which can modulate the sensory signals  
              carried to the brain by the incoming, or afferent, innervation.  The statocyst 
               organs of cephalopod invertebrates (cuttlefish, squid, octopus) are sensors
              used   for control of balance and posture, and have many features remarkably
              similar to   the vestibular parts of the vertebrate inner ear, also used for
              balance.  These   statocyst organs receive extensive efferent innervation, and
              one of the   compounds found here is nitric oxide (NO), which is currently of
              great interest in   mammalian nervous systems as a potential neurotransmitter
              or neuromodulator.    This project uses a multidisciplinary approach of
              physiology, pharmacology, and   anatomy to localize and characterize the
              activity of the enzyme nitric oxide   synthase (NOS), its product, NO, and
              interactions of NO with second messenger   systems such as cyclic GMP and
              cyclic AMP.  Results from this model   invertebrate system will be important
              beyond clarifying cephalopod statocyst   function, because they will provide a
              better understanding of evolutionary   convergence of equilibrium sense organs,
              and understanding of mechanisms of   action of NO, with broad implications for
              neuroscience in general.
