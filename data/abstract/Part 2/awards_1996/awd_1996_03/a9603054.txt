Abstract    :
              INT 9603054  Gruendler        This U.S-Slovak mathematics research project
              between Dr. Joseph Gruendler of North Carolina A&T State University and Dr.
              Michal Feckan of Comenius University will feature an examination of chaos in
              differential equations with a homoclinic orbit.  Together, the researchers
              intend to extend their collaboration to work on equations with a center
              manifold in finite and infinite dimensions.  In doing so, the corresponding
              scales of Banach spaces techniques of Vanderbauwhede will be applied.  Results
              for the finite-dimensional dynamical systems are expected to be applicable to
              elastic beam vibrations.    This mathematics project fulfills the program
              objectives of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United
              States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and share research
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.    ??
