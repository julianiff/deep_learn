Abstract    :
              9603917  Sachs    Certain conceptual issues have continued to vex scientists
              throughout history.  For example, distinctions between nature vs nurture and
              between appetitive vs consummatory elements of behavior.  This debate is fueled
              by the difficulty in distinguishing  between a strong desire (appetitive)  and
              the outcome of that desire (consummatory) just as it is difficult to separate
              the role of biology (nature) from the environment (nurture) on behavior.  Dr.
              Sachs may have the model system to address the appetitive-consummatory issue
              since he is able to separate arousal from the motivation-performance aspect of
              the behavior.  Using a variety of techniques ranging from the classic endocrine
              manipulations to analyzing immediate early gene expression in specific brain
              regions, he will identify the sensory, neural, and hormonal mechanisms that
              underlie this autonomic armusal process. Dr. Sachs will use his model to
              explore the relationship between autonomic arousal process, brain, and
              behavior.  The results will not only provide novel information about the
              central and peripheral mechanisms underlying arousal but will also contribute
              to our conceptual understanding of  the distinction between appetitive and
              consummatory elements of the behavior.
