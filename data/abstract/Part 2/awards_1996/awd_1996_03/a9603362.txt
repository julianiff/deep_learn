Abstract    :
              This two-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in atmospheric science
              involves Cesar Valladares and Dwight Decker of Boston College and Denis Alcayde
              and his group at the Centre D'Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements in Toulouse,
              France.  The award provides travel and subsistence support to the U.S.
              investigators for trips to the United Kingdom and France.  The objective of the
              research is to investigate the global characteristics of plasma structuring
              that develops in the polar cap and auroral oval.  They will conduct joint
              analysis, interpretation, modeling of data collected by the incoherent
              scattering radars at Sondrestrom, Greenland, and EISCAT, Scandinavia.  The
              project takes advantage of access to radar data from Scandinavia and of the
              complementary expertise of the U.S. and French investigators in modeling.  The
              project advances understanding of plasma structure and irregularities in
              ionospheric density in the polar cap.
