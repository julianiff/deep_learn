Abstract    :
              This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  The project will investigate
              the behavioral ecology of resource use and common property management of the
              Ecuadorian Huaorani Indians, in the context of regional petroleum development. 
              The Indian community are hunter-gatherer-horticulturalists who live in a
              lowland moist tropical forest in the Ecuadorian Amazon.  The development
              industry has made wage labor available to the Indians, causing the men to
              migrate to work sites.  The study will assess how the Indians are changing
              their relationship to forest resources in light of these new wage payments. 
              The potential for ecological sustainability will be studied through analyzing
              indigenous conservation of faunal resources through an optimal diet breadth
              analysis.  Economic sustainability will be investigated through time
              allocation, diet, and household diversification studies.  This project will
              integrate two bodies of theory, from evolutionary ecology (foraging theory) and
              political ecology (common property theory), to contribute to a new perspective
              that is cognizant of human adaptability and the influence of larger economic,
              social and political context.  The research is also valuable because it will
              contribute to our nation's expertise about this important area of the world.
