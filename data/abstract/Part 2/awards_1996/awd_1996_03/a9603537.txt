              award supports partial travel expenses for attendees at the  18th Texas
              Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics, to be held in  Chicago, IL on 15-20
              December, 1996. Prominent topics at this  year's meeting will include pulsars,
              supernovae, solar neutrinos,  X-ray astronomy, gamma ray bursts, astrophysical
              magnetic fields,  dark matter, nuclear astrophysics, big-bang nucleosynthesis,
              the  cosmic microwave background, gravitational lenses, galaxy  clusters,
              large-scale structure and galaxy formation, measurement  of the cosmological
              parameters, the interaction of particle  physics and cosmology in the early
              universe, active galactic  nuclei, quasar absorption line systems, gravity wave
              detection,  numerical general relativity, quantum gravity, and cosmic rays. 
              The highlight of this year's meeting is particle astrophysics.
