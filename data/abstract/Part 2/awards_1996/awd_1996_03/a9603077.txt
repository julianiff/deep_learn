                                         PROJECT SUMMARY                                      
                         We seek a new technique for very high speed characterization and 
              sequencing of polynucleotides such as DNA. The approach relies on  the notion
              that a linear polymer passing through a suitably small  channel or pore in an
              otherwise impermeable interface will  sequentially  modify the local properties
              of the pore in a manner that reflects  the sequence of monomers in the polymer.
              Our recent results using  model RNA and DNA polymers that were
              electrophoretically driven  through a protein channel in a lipid bilayer
              demonstrate the  promise of this approach, but are limited by the delicacy of
              the  organic protein-lipid interface which cannot tolerate the  denaturants and
              temperatures required to eliminate base pairing  and other secondary structures
              in  native polynucleotides. The short term goals of this proposal are  to
              develop a robust, inorganic interface (silicon nitride) that  will duplicate
              the results obtained with the organic interface  and  lead to the development
              of an instrument for very high speed  sizing of native polynucleotides.
              Accomplishing these short term  goals will demonstrate the feasibility of using
              a small channel  in an inorganic interface as the base on which to develop a
              novel  sensing device for high speed sequencing of single DNA molecules. 
              Because this approach eliminates several of the currently  required preparatory
              chemical steps in DNA sequencing, and  because it depends on inherently  rapid,
              molecular events, success with this method will be an  extraordinarily
              important advance that should reduce the time and  cost of nucleic acid
              sequencing by several orders of magnitude.
