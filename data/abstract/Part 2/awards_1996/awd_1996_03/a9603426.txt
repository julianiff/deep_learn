Abstract    :
              9603426  Barbara    This award supports the participation of American scientists
               in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Photophysics and Photoconversion  in Small Domains
              by Near-Field Scanning Optical Microscopy  to be held in Palm Springs,
              California from January 6-9,  l998.  The seminar will address how near-field
              optical  methods, and related confocal microscopic approaches can be  used to
              address many of the key issues in mesoscopic  photochemistry and photophysics. 
              The meeting will include  experts in areas broadly ranging from near-field
              optical  microscopy, photochemistry of nonoparticles, spectroscopy of 
              aggregates, scanning probe methods, photosynthesis, and  quantum confinement of
              electronic wavefunctions.    The most efficient and most promising man-made and
              natural  photosynthetic/photoconversion media take advantage of  mesoscopic
              structural organization to optimize key  structural and dynamic processes.  One
              of the most exciting  new tools for the study of photoconversion and
              photophysics  in mesostructures is Near-Field Scanning Optical Microscopy. 
              This technique combines various spectroscopies and  photochemical techniques
              with scanning probe methodology,  offering unprecedented mesosocopic scale data
              on various  materials.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese  experts
              in this field will enable U.S. participants to  advance their own work, and
              will set the stage for future  collaborative projects.  Participants' papers
              will be  published in a journal and abstracts will be made available  on the
              World Wide Web.  ***
