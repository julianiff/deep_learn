Abstract    :
              9603595  Fromm  The structure of Adenylosuccinate synthetase from E. coli, the
              first committed step in the conversion of IMP to AMP in the de novo purine
              nucleotide biosynthetic pathway, as the unligated enzyme and complexed, with a
              variety of substrates and substrate analogs, is now available.  During the
              proposed grant period the PI will prepare and study the properties of mutant
              forms of AMPSase, based on the crystal structure, in an attempt to gain insight
              into the enzyme's catalytic and regulatory mechanisms at the molecular level. 
              Those mutant forms of AMPSase that appear to be of interest will be
              crystallized where possible and subjected to structural analysis.  The mode of
              AMPSase regulation is not known; however, the state of subunit association may
              play a role in the regulation of AMPSase activity and this possibility will be
              investigated using both kinetic and physical techniques.  It was found that
              mixing of two different inactive mutant forms of AMPSase can lead to the
              formation of active heterodimers.  The physical basis behind this finding will
              be investigated.    ***  AMPSase synthetase is an enzyme that plays a crucial
              role in all living organisms.  It catalyzes the first committed step in the
              biosynthesis of purine nucleic acids, which go on to form DNA and RNA, along
              with other cellular nucleotides of importance in regulation of metabolism. 
              Understanding how this enzyme functions can also have potential for the design
              of chemotherapeutic agents.  ***
