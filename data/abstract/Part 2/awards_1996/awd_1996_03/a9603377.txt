Abstract    :
                This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research on genetic
              recombination   involves Stephen Kowalczykowski of the University of California
              at Davis, Alain Nicolas,   Marie Dutreix, and Francis Fabre of the Institut
              Curie in Paris, France.  The award   provides travel support and living
              expenses to Dr. Kowalczykowski and a graduate   student.  The objective of
              their research is to investigate homologous pairing and   subsequent exchange
              of DNA strands.  This process is mediated by a unique class of   proteins
              represented by the prototypic RecA protein from Escherichia coli and by the new
                Rad51 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  The U.S. investigator brings to
              this   collaboration expertise in the physical and biochemical aspects of
              recombination.  This is   complemented by French expertise in molecular
              genetics.  The project will advance   fundamental understanding of the
              biological processes involved in genetic recombination,   including aberrant
              processes that lead to deleterious genomic rearrangements.
