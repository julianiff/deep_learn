Abstract    :
                This three-year award supports US-France cooperative research on domain
              decomposition   methods for science and engineering problems.  The
              investigators are Charbel Farhat, Jan   Mandel, Xiao-Chuan Cai at the
              University of Colorado, Olof Widlund at New York   University, Yvon Maday,
              Universite Paris Sud and Armel de La Bourdonnaye at the   French National
              Institute for Research in Informatics and Applied Mathematics (INRIA).    The
              investigators will address interdisciplinary computational problems in
              large-scale   structural mechanics, fluid dynamics, electromagnetics, and
              fluid/structure dynamics.  The   research involves theoretical and analytical
              studies on domain decomposition, parallel   processing and high performance
              computing, and technological studies on stress analysis   and mechanical
              vibration of automotive structures, real gas flows at high Mach and   Reynolds
              numbers, and aeroelastic analysis of full configurations.  The US and French
              investigators' backgrounds and skills are complementary.  The project   takes
              advantage of French expertise in applied mathematics and engineering and will  
              contribute toward the next generation computational methods and computational  
              mechanics software.
