Abstract    :
              PI:  Heidemann  IBN:  9603640    Nerve cells, or neurons, are cells for which
              shape is critical for connections to distant targets.  We understand very
              little about how the long structures, called neurites, are formed and become
              distinct for receiving information (a dendrite) or sending information (an
              axon).  Recent studies have suggested that physical tension produced during
              development may have a role in determining the axonal or dendritic polarity as
              a cell elongates.  This project, a collaboration between a biologist and a
              physicist, utilizes a novel technique of microscopically applying calibrated
              tension using fine glass needles on brain cells in culture, to characterize the
              cellular response to tension, the possible production of tension by parts of
              the neurite, and the crucial issue of whether tension can determine
              morphological polarity of the developing cell at a critical stage.  Results
              from this innovative, multi-disciplinary collaboration could provide a
              potential breakthrough in understanding a key aspect of neuronal development,
              and be important beyond neuroscience to developmental biology and to cell
              biology.
