Abstract    :
              9603418  Sun    This award supports a three year collaborative research  project
              between Professor  Tai-ping Sun of Duke University in North Carolina and Dr. 
              Yuji Kamiya of the Institute of Physical and Chemical  Research (RIKEN) in
              Saitama, Japan.  The project is a study  of the regulatory mechanisms of
              gibberellin biosynthesis and  response in Arabidopsis.  Gibberellins (GAs) are
              diterpenoid  compounds, some of which are plant growth regulators,  controlling
              such diverse processes as seed germination, stem  elongation, and flower
              development.  There are three major  goals of this project:  1) examine the
              effect of light on  the expression of the first gene (GA1) in the Arabidopsis
              GA  biosynthetic pathway to understand how light regulates GA  concentrations
              in responding tissues;  2) examine the  effects of overproduction of the first
              two enzymes (ent-  kaurene syntheses A and B) in the GA biosynthetic pathway on
               plant growth; and  3) measure the GA content of new GA-response mutants that 
              have been isolated to determine whether these mutations  alter GA metabolism.  
               The project brings together the efforts of two laboratories  that have
              constituted different parts of the process: the  Americans will provide the new
              GA-response mutants and the  Japanese will perform the GA measurements.  The
              results of  this project will identify regulatory mechanisms of GA 
              biosynthesis and organ-specific GA responses that are now  unclear.  Through
              the exchange of ideas and technology, this  project will broaden our base of
              basic knowledge and promote  international understanding and cooperation.
