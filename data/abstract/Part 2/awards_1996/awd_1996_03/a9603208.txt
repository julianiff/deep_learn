Abstract    :
              ***  9603208  Mogensen    This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative
              research in plant genetic engineering   involves H. Lloyd Mogensen and Paul
              Keim at Northern Arizona University and Christian   Dumas and Mireille Rougier
              at the Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Lyon, France.  The objective of the
              research is to conduct B chromosome-facilitated studies of male   gametes and
              fertilization in maize.  The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration  
              expertise in hybridization analysis and cell sorting.  This is complemented by
              the French   investigators' novel techniques in in vitro fertilization of
              plants.  The project will advance   fundamental understanding of the B
              chromosome and sperm cell behavior and is of direct   importance to
              reproduction in maize specifically, and flowering plants in general.  ***
