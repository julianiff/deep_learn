Abstract    :
              9603561  Stewart    This  proposal requests support for travel compensation  for
               graduate  students to present results of basic  research  at  the third World
              Conference of Herpetology.  No other meeting  in  the field of herpetology
              bring together such a diversity  of  researchers and veiwpoints as does this 
              Congress.   The  Congress will be held in Prague, Czech Republic from  August 
              2  -  10, 1997.  The previous World Congresses have provided  avenues for
              presenting current, innovative, problem-oriented  biology  that  have
              contributed to the advancement  of  many  disciplines  of  science.   The 
              third  World  Congress   is  designed  in a similar multidisciplinary fashion. 
              As  such,  these   meetings  are  of  particular  value  to   students. 
              Individual  travel  awards  will  be  made  by  a  selection  committee  of 
              three  experts  (one  each  from  the   major  cooperating  U.S.-based
              societies, the American  Society  of  Ichthyologists   and   Herpetologists, 
              the   Herpetologists  League,  and  the  Society  for  Study  of  Amphibians  
              and  Reptiles).  The experience gained by student-participants at  this 
              conference  will help insure that researchers  in  the  United States remain at
              the center of international research  activity   concerning  general  advances 
              in  biology,   and  particularly advances in the biology of lower vertebrates.
