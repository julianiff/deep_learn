Abstract    :
                   Color vision in humans is best in a small central region of the retina of
              the eye.    This region, called the fovea, contains a very high proportion of
              the   photoreceptors called cone cells, which are specialized for different
              wavelengths   of the visible spectrum.  Cone cells are present but not so
              densely packed   outside the fovea, and we have very little understanding of
              whether the foveal   processes such as "color opponent" mechanisms work in
              these more peripheral   areas where there is a far higher proportion of the rod
              photoreceptors that are   not specialized for color.  This study uses a novel
              approach integrating the latest   anatomical data with quantitative
              psychophysical experiments to determine the   role of wavelength and intensity
              in color vision for stimuli striking outside the   fovea.     Results will
              provide an excellent test whether our models for foveal color vision   are
              generally valid or need modification, and will have an impact not only on  
              visual neuroscience, but on artificial vision and the psychology of perception.
