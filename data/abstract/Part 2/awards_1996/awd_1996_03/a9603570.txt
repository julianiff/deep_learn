Abstract    :
              -  9603570  Stamps    This award provides partial support for ten young United
              States scientists to attend the 25th International Ethological Conference (IEC)
              to held in Vienna, Austria from August 20-27, 1997. The IEC attracts scientists
              from over 40 nations, and it is the only international gathering that brings
              together scientists interested in all aspects of animal behavior. In addition,
              since its inception nearly 50 years ago, the IEC has fostered links between
              animal behavior and related disciplines. Indeed, a major theme of the Vienna
              conference is identifying and forging connections between traditional fields in
              animal behavior (e.g. sensory mechanisms, behavioral ecology, development), and
              related fields, including neurobiology, endocrinology, conservation and
              evolutionary biology. Over the years, previous NSF travel awards to the IEC
              have gone to 111 young investigators, many of whom have subsequently become
              leaders in the field. The IEC is enriched by the participation of outstanding
              young investigators at the outset of their careers, while colleagues and
              potential collaborators from around the.world.
