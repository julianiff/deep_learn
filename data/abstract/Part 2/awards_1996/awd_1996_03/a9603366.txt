Abstract    :
                This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in
              neuroendocrinology   involves the research group of Yonathan Zohar of the
              United States Air Force Academy   and Sylvie Dufour of the Museum of Natural
              History in Paris, France.  The award   provides travel and living expenses to
              Dr. Zohar, a postdoctoral researcher, and a   graduate student for short-term
              visits to France.  The objective of the research is to   investigate the
              differential regulation of two forms of Gonadotropin releasing hormone   (GnRH)
              present in teleost fish, the European eel, and striped bass.  This hormone  
              produced in the brain is essential for the control of reproduction in all
              vertebrates.   In   particular, the investigators are interested in the
              differential roles of multiple GnRHs and   their involvement in reproduction in
              a single species.  The project takes advantage of the   complementary expertise
              of the investigators and will advance our understanding of the   function of
              multiple GnRH in reproduction.
