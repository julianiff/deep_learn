Abstract    :
              9603681  Polacco  The long-range goal of the work is understanding of nickel
              metabolism in plants.  The specific objective of this work is to understand the
              insertion of nickel into urease.  Two mutants of soybean are available which
              abolish nickel insertion insertion into urease without affecting the amount of
              urease protein - which is inactive - in the plant.  The mutants encode proteins
              that bind nickel and these two proteins seem to be urease accessory proteins
              which insert the nickel into the enzyme.  The work will involve genetic
              analysis of the two mutants, molecular analysis of the interaction between
              urease and accessory binding proteins through a yeast two-hybrid system, and
              biochemical analysis of urease activity reconstitution by the presence of the
              two accessory proteins.  The analysis will provide information on the
              mechanisms of metal insertion into enzymes, protein/protein interaction and
              regulation of urease activity.
