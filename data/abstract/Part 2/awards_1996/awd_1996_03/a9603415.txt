Abstract    :
                This three-year award for U.S.-U.K. cooperative research involves Alexander
              Ruzmaikin,   Michael Freedman and Joan Feynman from California State
              University/Northridge and   Mitchell Berger and Renzo Ricca from University
              College London, London, United   Kingdom.  The award provides travel and living
              expenses for Dr. Ruzmaikin's visits to the   United Kingdom.  The objective of
              the research is to investigate the application of the   mathematics of topology
              to solar and heliospheric physics problems.  In particular, these  
              applications will address fundamental questions that involve the complex
              magnetic field of   the Sun.  They will study the equilibrium and dynamics of
              magnetic flux tubes in the solar   interior and atmosphere and conditions
              related to the initiation of flares, coronal mass   ejections and turbulent
              flows in the Sun and solar wind.  The project is interdisciplinary   and brings
              together U.S. experts in solar physics and U.K. mathematicians.
