Abstract    :
              ***  9603218  Hyde-Wright    This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative
              research in nuclear physics involves   faculty, students and postdoctoral
              researchers at Old Dominion University and at the   Universite Blaise Pascal in
              Clermont-Ferraud, France.  The award will provide travel   support to Charles
              E. Hyde-Wright and his colleagues to collaborate with Pierre-Yves   Bertin and
              his research group.  The research is primarily focused on physics opportunities
                at the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) in Newport News,
                Virginia.  The objective of the U.S. investigators' travel to France is to
              work on   measurements and analysis from their experiments in virtual compton
              scattering (VCS)   and to provide research opportunities for graduate students.
              The project takes advantage   of the complementary experimental and theoretical
              expertise of the U.S. and French   investigators.  ***
