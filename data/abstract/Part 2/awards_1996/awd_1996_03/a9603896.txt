Abstract    :
              9603896  Webb  The morphology of a unique connection between the swim bladder
              and the mechanosensory lateral line canal system in the head of tropical coral
              reef butterflyfishes will be described for the first time.  It is hypothesized
              that this unique "laterophysic" connection makes the lateral line system, which
              is normally only sensitive to fluid movement, sensitive to fluid movement,
              sensitive to pressure stimuli such as sound.  3-D reconstruction of
              histological material will be used to describe morphological variation in the
              laterophysic connection in three Chaetodon spies and to compare them with
              butterflyfishes in two general that lack the connection to better define the
              structural features that characterize this sensory specialization.  Anatomical
              specializations in a single genus that change the function of a sensory system
              are rare.  The laterophysic connection is an excellent system in which to study
              the evolutionary functional morphology of a sensory specialization.  Chaetodon
              is a well-known and ecologically important genus of coral reef fishes for which
              we have an expanding body of ecological and behavioral data, and a
              well-supported hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships.  The results of this
              study will lead to collaborative neuroanatomical and behavioral investigations
              of the function of this unique sensory specialization.
