Abstract    :
              Conlon  9603627            The ribs and the vertebral column arise exclusively
              from an array of transient embryonic structures, the somites. The mechanism of
              somite segmentation is of considerable interest as a basic patterning process
              that directly affects the vertebral column as well as indirectly affecting a
              wide spectrum of trunk structures in normal human development. Perturbations of
              somitogenesis by gene mutation and environmental insult are likely to underlie
              a broad range of congenital malformations including some proportion of spine
              bifida, non-myopathic scoliosis and other dysraphic disorders. This proposal
              investigates the hypothesis that the embryonic midline signals to coordinate
              somite segmentation on the two sides of the embryo. The nature and identity of
              these signals will be identified by experiments performed in vitro on the
              embryos of the mouse. The proposed experiments are designed to increase our
              understanding of segmentation, specifically the way in which it is coordinated
              in the two segmental primordia, so that they can later give rise to the single,
              segmented vertebral column.
