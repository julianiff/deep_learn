Abstract    :
                   Projects are proposed in two areas of nuclear theory.  The first area
              concerns the structure of nuclei above the  threshold for emitting constituent
              nucleons.  Development of  nuclear models for this energy region provide a
              means of  analyzing and correlating data from nucleon scattering  experiments
              and experiments in which a nucleon is knocked  out from a nucleus by a variety
              of probes, such a electrons  and mesons.  These investigations provide
              information on the  structure of nuclei at high excitation and the distribution
               of nucleons within nuclei.       The second area is hypernuclear physics. 
              Hypernuclei  contain at least one baryon with non-zero strangeness or  charm. 
              Although their lifetimes are very short, hypernuclei  provide a laboratory for
              determining the interaction of  exotic baryons with nucleons and with each
              other.  They also  provide the only practical means for studying a particular 
              decay mode for the strange baryons.  This decay mode, unlike  the decay of a
              free strange baryon, is one in which no  mesons are produced.  Investigations
              are proposed for both  determining the interactions of these exotic baryons and
              the  mechanism for non-mesonic decay.
