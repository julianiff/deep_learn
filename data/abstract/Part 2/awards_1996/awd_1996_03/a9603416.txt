Abstract    :
              The proposed collaboration with G¼nther Heinemann of the University of Bonn  
              investigate the katabatic wind system over the ice sheet and the coastal
              regions of   Greenland.  Two mesoscale numerical models will be used to obtain
              climatologically   relevant numerical simulations of a few months' duration. 
              The model used by the Bonn   group has a horizontal resolution of 25 or 50
              kilometers; the one used by the U.S. group is   the Pennsylvania State
              University/National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale   Model version
              5, modified for ice sheet meteorology, with a resolution of 25 kilometers.   
              Results of an observational study by the Bonn group will be used to verify the
              accuracy of   the numerical simulations, and a comparison of modeling
              techniques and results will be   used to improve model parametrizations and to
              lead to a clearer understanding of the role   that Greenland's katabatic winds
              play in North Atlantic climate.
