Abstract    :
                The objective of the proposal is to utilize laboratory plasma  experiments to
              identify the physics and characterize the signatures  of space-relevant
              fluctuations, small-scale irregularities, and  particle heating induced by
              velocity-shear driven mechanisms.  In  particular, the project will attempt to,
              1.) determine the  dependence of Kelvin-Helmholz, inhomogeneous energy-density
              driven,  and electron-ion hybrid Kelvin-Helmholtz excitation thresholds on 
              shear parameters, 2.) test the ability to seed shear-driven  turbulence at the
              edges of nonlinearly evolved Kelvin-Helmholtz  vortices in plasma potential,
              3.) distinguish the ion heating  induced by different shear-driven waves from
              that resulting from  current-driven waves, and 4.) determine the influence of 
              introducing small concentrations of a second positive-ion species  on items 1-3
              above.  The specific long range goals are to improve  the interpretation of the
              dynamically intense geomagnetic activity  that arises at the edges of auroral
              arcs and in black aurora and to  provide quantitative comparisons to
              theoretical models used to  interpret space observations.
