Abstract    :
                9603735  Zeh      Discoveries in molecular biology are providing growing 
              evidence that the genomes of species are dynamic entities,  constantly
              evolving, at least in part, as a result of  genetic conflicts within and
              between the nucleus and the  cytoplasm. Selfish genetic elements, such as
              cellular  endosymbionts, transposable elements, segregation distorter  alleles,
              maternal effect lethal alleles, as well as  hyperavailable ("junk") DNA and
              imbalances in genomically-  imprinted genes, can all undermine female fitness
              by  rendering certain combinations of maternal and paternal  genotypes
              incompatible within the developing embryo.    The development of single-locus
              minisatellite DNA probes for  the pseudoscorpion, Cordylochernes scorpioides,
              in  combination with a mammalian-like viviparous reproductive  biology highly
              amenable to experimentation and involving the  production of large numbers of
              offspring, makes this species  a model system for investigating the effects of
              paternal  genotypes on female fitness. Through a research program  involving
              behavioral analyses, breeding experiments and DNA  profiling, this study will
              test the hypothesis that cellular  and molecular interactions within the female
              reproductive  tract can provide females with mechanisms for minimizing the 
              risk and/or cost of fertilization by genetically-  incompatible sperm. This
              genetic incompatibility hypothesis  will be tested against several previously
              proposed  hypotheses to explain how paternal genotypes can influence  female
              reproductive success, namely the trading-up  hypothesis, the inbreeding
              avoidance hypothesis and the  intrinsic male quality hypothesis.
