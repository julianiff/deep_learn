Abstract    :
              Powers  9603009  The keystone symposium on molecular mechanisms of evolution
              will be held at Santa Fe, n. M., February 16 through February 21, 1997. The
              meeting will consider molecular mechanisms of evolution regulating development,
              the organization and expression of multigene families, the role of insertion
              elements in evolution, the functional consequences of evolutionary change in
              protein structure and ancestral sequence reconstruction among other topics.    
              This meeting will bring together scientists from several disciplines and from
              all scientific ages in a setting conducive to meaningful interactions.
