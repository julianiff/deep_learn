Abstract    :
              9603346  Williams    Findings from recent studies indicate that educational
              technology has had positive effects on  student achievement, on student
              attitudes toward learning, and on students' self- concept.  Experts agree that
              the future of education depends upon the successful integration of technology
              into classrooms across the country. However, hundreds of efforts to integrate
              technology into schools fail each year because school board members-most
              lacking an understanding of the value of technology and of the policy support
              that technology requires, and few being technology-users themselves-are often
              barriers to the integration of technology into the education of all students. 
              Simply stated, in order to make technology accessible in classrooms and enable
              teachers to use that technology effectively, school board members must be
              helped to understand technology's potentials.  The National School Boards
              Association (NSBA) Foundation requests a grant of $123,677 from the National
              Science Foundation's Network Infrastructure for Education program to launch a 
              project to engage school board members as leaders in bringing the benefits of
              technology to school districts across the country. NSBA is the national
              organization that supplies information to the 95,000 school board members
              nationwide and, through NSBA's Institute for the Transfer of Technology to
              Education (ITTE), is uniquely suited to address the issue of helping school
              board members make appropriate policy decisions and become advocates for
              technology implementation in schools.  The Tools for Systemic Reform: A
              Dissemination Initiative for School Board members project described on the
              following pages will disseminate a policy makers tool kit of information on
              systemic school reform supported with technology and facilitate the tool kit's
              use with expert-guided on-line discussion and with hands-on help. The tool kit
              will be distributed to public school board members and other school decision
              makers through a variety of electronic and other f ar-reaching dissemination
              methods, and will include modules of information on case studies of successful
              school models, contact information, research-based findings, discussion guides,
              and a broad range of strategies for utilizing technology to improve student
              achievement in math, science, and other subject areas. Information disseminated
              will help policy makers understand  the positive change that technology can
              bring to the dynamic of teaching and learning, encourage their personal use of
              technology, and will establish a foundation of the appropriate policy and
              management support necessary to hasten widespread, effective use of technology
              throughout school districts across the country.
