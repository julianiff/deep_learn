Abstract    :
              Dynamical systems techniques have tremendous potential for application in the
              area of   nonlinear optics.  Important problems of optical communication, such
              as the stability of   pulse propagation and locking of multiple pulses can be
              formulated as problems   susceptible to the modern geometric techniques of
              dynamical systems.  This proposal   involves a collaboration with a German
              group headed by Tassilio K¼pper of the University   of Cologne.  One goal of
              the collaboration is to involve graduate students in the research   and expose
              them to both sides of the work through travel to Germany.  Problems  
              considered will be the stability of nonlinear waveguide modes relative to the
              full Maxwell-  Bloch system, multiple pulse propagation, and the locking of
              pulses on coupled fibers.    Techniques used will be bifurcation theory,
              stability indices, bifurcation from the essential   spectrum, and numerical
              investigations.
