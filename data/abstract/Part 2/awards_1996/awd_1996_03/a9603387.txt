Abstract    :
              9603387  Lownds    The Digital Desert Library (DDL) project envisions a new kind
              of expanding library, available via the Internet and DC-ROM, providing both
              instructional materials and space for continuous scientific collaboration,
              communication, and development among diverse school, museum, and university
              participants.  In addition to providing a means for teachers and communities,
              particularly those with traditionally under-represented groups, to share their
              own scientific "funds of knowledge" (Moll, 1993), other currently undigitized
              resources also will become available to schools. For example, The Smithsonian
              Institution's  National Museum of Natural History will contribute historical,
              scientific and cultural resources from its highly acclaimed The Seeds of Change
              program; and New Mexico State University will contribute scientific results and
              video clips from its experiment station and video productions (such as
              Survivors in the Sand). The project will build on other work already underway,
              such as The Desert Classroom, a laserdisc and instructional materials developed
              with teachers through New Mexico SIMSE (NSF-funded Systemic Initiative in
              Science and Mathematics Education); and Los Ninos y La Tierra (The Children and
              the Earth), with cultural and gardening resources from small villages in
              Northern New Mexico gathered by a non-profit group to support cultural
              traditions in science education.  Collaboration will be the key method
              employed, meaning teachers will work with, not for, university and museum
              multimedia developers and educators to create exciting resources and spaces for
              learning science, including well-developed models, accessible through this
              digital library.  The Objectives can be summarized as: 1) creating top-quality
              electronic library resources through collaboration among diverse students and
              teachers, with nationally recognized specialists in information, multimedia,
              video, science, and education; 2) creating digital and real-world environments
              for asynchronous and synchrono us learning across time, location and cultures;
              3) modeling adaptation of exemplary curricula with local, real-world learning
              in multicultural classrooms through the power of digital technologies; 4)
              distributing both the library resources and successful development and
              implementation models; and 5) institutionalizing the Digital Desert Library,
              the developmental process, and the implementation strategies to ensure
              sustainability.  The numerous expected outcomes focus on both creating an
              outstanding digital library of resources from scientific and multicultural
              communities, and also on modeling a process for integration of these products
              into meaningful learning. The DDL, its development process and implementation
              strategies will be institutionalized within the Smithsonian's  Natural Partners
              Initiative, the systemic change initiative programs, and NMSU's Extension and
              4-H programs to ensure sustainability and expansion of the processes after this
              funding is completed.  ***
