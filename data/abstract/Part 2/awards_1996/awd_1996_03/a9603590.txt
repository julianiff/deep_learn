Abstract    :
              9603590  Levin    The functional contacts between nerve cells are called
              synapses,  and the biochemical compounds that carry signals between the cells 
              at the synapse are called neurotransmitters.  The transmitter  molecules are
              captured on the surface of the cell membrane of the  target cell by molecules
              called receptors.  Classes of  transmitters, like particular amino acids, or
              particular  catecholamine compounds, were known to have particular receptor 
              types that triggered particular responses in the post-synaptic  cell.  More
              recently, subtypes of receptor molecules have been  found, often with different
              chemical binding affinities, molecular  arrangement, and coupling mechanisms. 
              This symposium covers recent  advances at the molecular level in understanding
              the subtypes of  the particular receptors called muscarinic receptors, which 
              modulate the responses of nerve and muscle cells to a widespread 
              neurotransmitter called acetylcholine.  Support is to help cover  some travel
              costs young investigators in the field to be able to  attend and deliver their
              own research results at this meeting.   This support will have an impact on
              fostering the career  development of young neuroscientists, and the symposium 
              presentations will have an impact on muscle and cardiovascular  research as
              well as neuroscience.
