Abstract    :
              9603264  Vashishta    This award supports a three-year collaborative research 
              project between Professor Priya Vashishta of Louisiana State  University at
              Baton Rouge and Professor Hiroshi Iyetomi of  Niigata University in Japan.  The
              researchers will undertake  studies of molecular dynamics simulations of
              synthetic  functional materials on parallel computers.  The focus of  the
              project will be on large-scale atomistic simulations of  materials used in the
              electronics industry.  They plan to  carry out the following activities: 
              develop parallel  algorithms for electronic structure calculations and MD 
              simulations; perform electronic structure analyses of  targeted materials;
              perform large-scale MD simulation; and  carry out neutron-scattering
              experiments.    The proposal brings together two groups that have 
              complementary computational skills and experimental  expertise in order to
              investigate various properties and  processes in these materials: electronic
              structure  calculations; parallel algorithms; large-scale molecular  dynamics
              simulations; and neutron scattering experiments.  Through the exchange of ideas
              and technology, this project  will broaden our base of basic knowledge and
              promote  international understanding and cooperation.  ***
