Abstract    :
                This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in materials
              science involves a   research group led by David Seidman at Northwestern
              University and the research   laboratory of Guy Treglia at the Universite de
              Mediterranee in Marseille, France.  The   award provides travel support and
              living expenses to Dr. Seidman, his associates, and a   graduate student.  The
              objective of the research is to investigate, on an atomic scale, the   kinetics
              of the dissolution of selected thin metallic films and the formation of the
              surface   alloy phase. The project takes advantage of the French investigators'
              theoretical model   which demonstrates a concentration profile near a surface
              that is derived from the   electronic structure.  The investigators propose to
              study this physical phenomenon   through the application of atom-probe
              field-ion microscopy.
