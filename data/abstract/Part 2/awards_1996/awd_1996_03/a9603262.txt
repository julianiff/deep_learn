Abstract    :
              9603262  Zhou    This award supports a three-year collaborative research 
              project between Professor Otto Zhou of the University of  North Carolina at
              Chapel Hill (UNC) and Dr. Yoshihiro Iwasa  at the Japan Advanced Institute of 
              Science and Technology  in Ishikawa, Japan.   The researchers will undertaking 
              studies of the design, synthesis and characterization of  fullerides.  Rational
              approaches will be adopted to  synthesize materials with the desired properties
               (electronic, optical and magnetic properties) from the  molecular level. 
              Investigations will involve:  1)  superconductivity in metal intercalated
              fullerides;  2)  metal-insulator transition, and  3) fullerene polymers.    The
              proposal brings together the efforts of two laboratories  that have constituted
              different parts of the process.  By  combining the strength in materials
              synthesis and structural  characterization at UNC with the expertise and
              facilities  for property measurements in Japan, the researchers will be  able
              to take a comprehensive approach to address the physics  and materials science
              issues of superconductivity in metal  fullerides and explore other novel carbon
              fullerene-based  compounds.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, 
              this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and  promote
              international understanding and cooperation.  ***
