Abstract    :
              INT 9603005  Cummings      This U.S.-Hungary research project between Dr. Peter
              Cummings of the University of Tennessee and Dr. Andras Baranyai of Eotvos
              University, Budapest, will examine the interfacial properties of shearing
              liquids in atomic/molecular detail using nonequilibrium molecular dynamic
              simulations.  The liquids employed may be liquid-vapor or liquid-liquid
              interfaces in the presence or in the absence of amphiphilic molecules.  This
              study, at the molecular level, is undertaken as a preliminary step toward being
              able to predict the mixing or demixing behavior of polymers.   
              Collaboratively, the U.S.-Hungarian team intends to: 1) develop simulation
              algorithms for this study; 2) model the structural properties of shearing
              interfaces at the molecular level;   3) calculate the physical properties of
              the interfaces and quantify the effect of the shear;  and 5) develop simulation
              algorithms for the study of phase separation in steady shearing systems.  In
              the process, the researchers will search for other possible simulation methods
              applicable to the study of nonequilibrium separation.  Results are expected to
              contribute to our understanding of fast flow conditions, such as those arising
              frequently in chemical, oil and gas industrial processing.    This joint
              project in chemical engineering research fulfills the program objective of
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States
              and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas
              of strong mutual interest and competence.   ??
