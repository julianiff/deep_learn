Abstract    :
                    The proposal requests funds to purchase several instruments  for image
              analysis: an  integrated phosphor-imager and direct 
              fluorescence/chemifluorescence system, a film recorder,  and a MacIntosh
              computer and dedicated system laser printer.  The three instruments will
              provide  critical image analysis capabilities presently unavailable  to
              Chemistry and Biology Department  graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and
              faculty.    Major research projects that will benefit from these  instruments
              are as follows: (1) Definition of  structural and energetic parameters for
              specific DNA binding  and cleavage by a restriction endonuclease-  a model
              system for studying enzyme-DNA complexes; (2)  Definition of  catalytic and
              recognition mechanisms of  bacterial DNA methyltransferases; (3) Mechanisms of
              iron  acquisition by marine micro-organisms; (4) Expression and 
              characterization of double-stranded RNA dependent enzymes  under interferon
              regulation; (5) Definition of the molecular  mechanisms involved in Ras
              function; (6) Structure-  function relationships of nuceic acid polymerases and
               microtubule-binding proteins studied by crystallographic and  biochemical
              approaches; (7) Structure-function analysis of  the acetylcholine transporter
              of synaptic vesicles.
