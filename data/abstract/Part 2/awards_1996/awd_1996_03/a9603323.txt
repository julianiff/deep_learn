Abstract    :
              This research project is a collaboration between Donald Janssen of the
              University of   Washington and Jochen Stark of the University of Weimar.  The
              purpose of the research is   to study the response of aggregate concretes to
              freeze-thaw cycles in order to understand   why they fail and to identify
              aggregates that are susceptible to damage.  The collaboration draws on the
              complementary expertise of the foreign and domestic   research groups, and the
              different testing methods make comparison testing possible.  The   German group
              has considerable experience in testing concrete for resistance to salt scaling 
               and the microstructural evaluation.  The U.S. group has 10 years of experience
                investigating D-cracking mechanisms and susceptibility.  Results of the
              collaboration are   expected to include development of improved identification
              of frost-susceptible   aggregates, improved understanding of the frost damage
              mechanism in aggregates, and the   development of U.S. experience in the use of
              alternate testing procedures.
