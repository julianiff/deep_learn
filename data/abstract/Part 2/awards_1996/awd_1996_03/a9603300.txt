Abstract    :
              9603300  Okamura    This award supports a two year collaborative research 
              project between Professor Melvin Okamura of the University  of California at
              San Diego and Dr. Teizo Kitagawa of the  Okazaki National Research Institute in
              Japan.  This project  undertakes a study of the elucidation of a coupling 
              mechanism of electron and proton transfers at the quinone-B  site of
              photosynthetic reaction centers by using resonance  Raman spectroscopy.  The
              major goals of this project are:  1) investigate the structure and function of
              photosynthetic  reaction centers;  2) determine the role of quinone-B in 
              electron and proton transfer; and  3) apply resonance Raman  studies to
              quinones in bacterial reaction centers.    The project brings together the
              efforts of two laboratories  that have constituted different parts of the
              process: the  Americans have expertise in the preparation and  characterization
              of reaction centers and the Japanese  laboratory has the facilities for
              extensive experience in  biological application of resonance Raman
              spectroscopy.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project  will
              broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote  international understanding
              and cooperation.  ***
