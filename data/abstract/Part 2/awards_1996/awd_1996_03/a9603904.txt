Abstract    :
              9603904  Amzel  The 1997 Johns Hopkins Protein Folding Meeting will be held
              March 15-18, 1997 at the Coolfont Conference Center in Berkeley Springs, West
              Virginia . The meeting has an excellent choice of topics and session leaders.
              It includes four three-hour sessions of presented talks. The first such meeting
              was generally judged as excellent. Key features include the involvement of
              graduate students and postdocs, and the low-key atmosphere of the meeting.   
              Protein folding is an area of active research that includes modeling,
              prediction of stability and prediction of structure.  This meeting presents a
              balanced discussion of theory, prediction methods, computational methods and
              experiments.  ***
