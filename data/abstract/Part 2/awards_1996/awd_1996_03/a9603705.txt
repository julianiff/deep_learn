Abstract    :
              Paul B. Green  9603705      The developmental mechanisms producing shoot
              patterns in plants are of interest for practical and theoretical reasons. The
              practical side involves branching and the physical stability of the plant as
              well as the yield of fruit or grain, which reflects the pattern in the flower
              producing it. The theoretical side relates to the fact that plants show only
              two centric patterns: whorls as in the iris flower, and crossed spirals as in
              the pine cone. Why only these two, with one of them (spirals) involving the
              golden section (1:0.618), long known as special irrational fraction in
              mathematics? This grant is to further establish that the explanation lies in
              the physical folding of tissue that occurs to produce the lateral organ, be it
              a limb, petal, flower, etc., at the top of the plant. Testing this idea
              requires advanced mathematics, but it is in range of current engineering
              analytical approaches.
