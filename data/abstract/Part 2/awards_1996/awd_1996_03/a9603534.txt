Abstract    :
                9603534  Wang    This award supports a three year program of cooperation in 
              solar physics research between Haimin Wang, New Jersey  Institute of
              Technology, and Ai Guoxiang, Beijing  Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy
              of Sciences.  This  award adds an international dimension to work funded under 
              CAREER award ATM 9628862. The opportunity to coordinate  longitudinal coverage
              of the sun and the ability to see  solar events from the Earth at different
              longitudes on Earth  are very important reasons to collaborate with China in
              this  field. China has assigned a high priority to solar research,  and does
              more research in this area than the U.S. does. This  cooperative program will
              allow U.S. researchers access to a  major space solar program initiated by the
              Chinese.    The Huairou Solar Observing Station of the Beijing  Astronomical
              Observatory is the center of solar physics  research in China.  Support for
              Chinese participation in the  project will be provided by the National Natural
              Science  Foundation of China.
