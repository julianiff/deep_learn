Abstract    :
              9603000  LYNCH    The project focuses on the hydrodynamics observed on Georges 
              Bank. The project will dynamically link the Dartmouth Georges  Bank (GB) model
              with the Rutgers North Atlantic Basin (NAB) model  in order to conduct a
              quantitative investigation of dynamical  linkages between Georges Bank and the
              adjacent basin-scale ocean.  If successful, the work will strengthen the
              predictability of how  circulation fields (e.g., mesoscale rings and eddies,
              fronts,  etc.) operate at the shelf break and seaward. The development of 
              simulations from the GLOBEC process studies and on the  identification of
              interannual variability in remote forcing  effects on Georges Bank will be
              emphasized. This project is a  part of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field
              Studies, Phase 2  program.  ***
