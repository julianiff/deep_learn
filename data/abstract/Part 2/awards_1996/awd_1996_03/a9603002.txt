Abstract    :
              9603002  Komanduri    This award supports a two year collaborative research 
              project between Professor Ranga Komanduri of the Oklahoma  State University and
              Professor Takahiro Shirakashi of the  Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan. 
              The focus of this  research is to delineate the micromechanisms of finishing 
              advanced materials such as ceramics and glasses.  The use of  ceramics for many
              advanced applications is hindered by the  high cost of finishing them. Both
              analytical and  experimental studies will be carried out.  On the analytical 
              side, molecular dynamics simulation and analysis of the  ultraprecision
              machining will be carried out.  On the  experimental side a variety of
              finishing operations will be  investigated including magnetic field assisted
              finishing  processes for internal and external finishing.    The proposal
              brings together the effort of two laboratories  that have complimentary
              expertise, research capabilities and  equipment.  The research should provide
              new knowledge of  magnetic field assisted polishing, ultra precision machining 
              of metals, `gentle' grinding of advance ceramics and  glasses, and in situ
              micromaching inside a scanning electron  microscope.  Through the exchange of
              ideas and technology,  this project will broaden our base of knowledge and
              promote  international understanding and cooperation.  ***
