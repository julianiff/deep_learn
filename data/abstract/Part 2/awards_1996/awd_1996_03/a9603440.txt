Abstract    :
                This award supports travel and living expenses of five U.S. participants in a
              U.S.-France   workshop to take place in Paris, France in 1997.  The objective
              is to coordinate efforts of   the U.S. Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and a
              similar European project called the   Deep Near-Infrared Sky Survey (DENIS). 
              The U.S. coordinator is Michael Skrutskie of   the University of Massachusetts.
               The European consortium is led by Nicolas Epchtein at   the Observatoire de
              Paris.  The  2MASS project will construct two 1.3m telescopes and   two
              infrared cameras to survey the entire sky beginning in early 1997.  DENIS aims
              to   survey a significant portion of the sky visible from the Southern
              Hemisphere.  At this   workshop, they propose to initiate sharing of
              experiences and information that will   improve the development and operations
              of the survey and will maximize the scientific   output of the combined
              surveys.
