Abstract    :
              We propose to integrate sample injection, capillary electrophoresis and  NMR
              (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) detection on a single silicon  substrate using
              MEMS (MicroElectroMechanical Systems) fabrication  techniques. The integration
              and micro scale dimensions (100 micron wide  flow channel, 100 micron diameter
              NMR coil) of the system will provide  increased separation efficiency ,
              decreased sample volumes  (nanoliters), and increased NMR detection coil
              sensitivity. Most  importantly, the precise geometrical control and material
              choices  afforded by using MEMS fabrication techniques will allow optimization 
              of running time, limit of detection and NMR spectral linewidth. The  design,
              fabrication and testing of the prototype system will  demonstrate proof of
              concept and leading to the development of a family  of integrated analytical
              instruments based on micro NMR detection.
