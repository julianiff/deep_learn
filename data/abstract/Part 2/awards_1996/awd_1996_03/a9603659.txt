Abstract    :
              9603659  Peterjohn  Recent declines in stratospheric ozone may expose native
              plants to greater levels of ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B).  While numerous
              studies have investigated the potentially damaging effects of UV-B on
              agricultural plants, few studies have examined how UV-B affects native plants
              or important ecosystem processes.  In this project, two field experiments will
              be conducted to determine whether UV-B changes the chemical composition of
              native plants in ways that alter the rate of nutrient release from decomposing
              plant tissue.  Decomposition of deal plant tissue is the major source of plant
              nutrients in natural ecosystems, and changes in the rate of decomposition may
              significantly alter soil fertility.  Six species of native plants will be grown
              under UV-B levels corresponding to a 0, 16, and 32% decrease in stratospheric
              ozone.  The effect of removing normal levels of UV-B will also be examined. 
              Data from this project will be used to test existing models of soil nutrient
              dynamics.  These models will then be used to evaluate whether the effects of a
              major change in UV-B are likely to have an important impact on soil fertility.
