Abstract    :
              9603034  Blankenship    This award supports the participation of American
              scientists  in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Molecular Organization of 
              Photosynthetic Antennas to be held in Hawaii from  April 16-20, l997.  The
              co-organizers are Professor Robert  Blankenship of Arizona State University and
              Dr. Mamoru  Mimuro of the National Institute for Basic Biology in Japan.  The
              seminar will address most of the known types of  photosynthetic antennas,
              including integral membrane  antennas from bacterial plant and algal systems as
              well as  peripheral antennas such as chlorosomes and phycobilisomes. 
              Approaches will include spectroscopy, structure  determination, molecular
              biology, protein chemistry, model  systems and theory.  Particular attention
              will be paid to  new concepts on the regulation and protection of antenna 
              systems as well as to evolutionary aspects.    This area of research has seen
              exceptionally rapid progress  in recent years, with the determination of
              several  structures of antenna complexes and the maturing of  ultrafast
              spectroscopic and molecular biological techniques  for investigation and
              manipulation of photosynthetic  systems.  All the areas and approaches are well
              represented  among the participants from both countries.  The exchange of 
              ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will  enable U.S.
              participants to advance their own work, and will  set the stage for future
              collaborative projects.  The  seminar will involve active participation by
              junior  investigators and postdoctoral researchers, and the results  of the
              meeting will be widely disseminated via a World Wide  Web homepage.  ***
