Abstract    :
              Livingston  9603515  The research investigated in this project utilizes
              classical genetic and molecular genetic techniques to examine the yeast RAD52
              gene.  This gene is important to protect yeast cells from ionizing radiation
              and to aid them in recombining their chromosomes.  By mutagenizing a cloned
              copy of the gene, rad52 mutants with varying properties can be  recovered. 
              Temperature sensitive mutations have already been made and characterized. 
              These mutants are conditionally sensitive to ionizing radiation but can
              recombine their chromosomes, suggesting that the protein product of the RAD52
              gene (Rad52p) may have more than one role.  The current project intends to
              examine three aspects of the biology of RAD52.  First, why do mutations
              altering amino acid residues in the N-terminal domain of Rad52p have a
              drastically different effect from those that change C-terminal residues? 
              Second, what genes encode proteins that interact either directly by physical
              interaction with Rad52p or indirectly by circumvention of the RAD52
              recombinational repair pathway?  Third, what role does Rad52p play in
              processing of double strand breaks made to initiate meiotic recombination?  The
              experimental plan begins with a focus on cold sensitive rad52 mutations and
              extragenic suppressors of these mutations.  Another set of experiments will
              utilize in vitro mutagenesis to explore the interaction between Rad52p and
              Rad51p, the protein product of another gene important in repair and
              recombination.  Finally, rad52 mutants will be examined for their inability to
              process meiotic double strand breaks in recombinant chromosomes.  The need of
              all organisms to defend themselves from natural radiation and to properly
              disjoin their chromosomes during gamete production has been evidenced by the
              recent discovery of RAD52 genes in may other organisms including humans.
