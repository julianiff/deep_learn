Abstract    :
              9603203  Shinozuka    This award supports the participation of American 
              scientists/engineers in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Civil  Infrastructure Systems
              Research to be held in Hawaii from  April 1-3, l997.  The co-organizers are
              Professors Masanobu  Shinozuka of the University of Southern California and 
              Makoto Watabe of Keio University in Japan.   This seminar  will provide a forum
              for identifying and comparing common  issues, for promoting cooperative
              research between the two  nations and formulating action plans involving the
              following  themes of study; science of aging and deterioration, health 
              monitoring and condition assessment, renewal engineering,  socio-economic
              issues, institutional effectiveness and  productivity, and research
              coordination.    Civil infrastructure systems (CIS) provide the societies' 
              basic ability to transport people and goods, to deliver  clean water, electric
              power, gas and liquid fuel, to  facilitate communications, to mitigate the
              impact of natural  disasters, and to serve many other functions for the 
              enhancement of the welfare and freedom of the general  public.  Accelerating
              rapid growth of the societal  activities and resulting demand for CIS is
              suppressing the  rate of new construction and retrofitting of existing CIS. 
              Both the U.S. and Japan share common problems of CIS and are  in need of
              cost-effective strategies for planning, design,  construction, maintenance and
              retrofit of  their respective  CISs. The exchange of ideas and data with
              Japanese experts  in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their 
              own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative  projects.  ***
