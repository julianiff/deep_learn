Abstract    :
                96-03591  Massey  1. Technical  This investigator has  isolated milk xanthine
              dehydrogenase in a stable state, which can be converted reversibly into the
              oxidized form, where the preferred electron acceptor is oxygen rather than NAD,
              as it is with the dehydrogenase form. This  work indicates that the major
              effects of this reversible interconversion, which is brought about by oxidation
              of spatially adjacent thiol residues in the dehydrogenase to oxidase
              conversion, involve conformational changes in the protein which affect mainly
              the flavin redox center. The major thrust of this research is to study in
              detail the physicochemical properties of the two forms of the enzyme, with the
              aim of defining the parameters that give the two forms such different catalytic
              properties. This study involves extensive use of rapid reaction
              spectrophotometry, flavin replacement studies, catalytic properties of the
              enzymes with different classes of substrates, and examination of the modes of
              binding and mechanism of potent inhibitors of the enzymes.    2. Nontechnical 
              The ability of xanthine oxidase to exist in two stable forms with very
              different catalytic properties makes it a very unusual enzyme. It is widely
              believed that this interconversion forms the basis of a variety of oxidative
              stress phenomena, because of the ability of the oxidase form to generate oxygen
              radicals. In order to assess such hypotheses, it is essential to have a
              thorough understanding of the properties of the two enzyme forms. This project
              is focused on such a study.
