Abstract    :
              9603429  Melngailis    This award supports the participation of American 
              scientists/engineers in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Formation of  Ion Nanobeams and
              Applications to Materials Processing to be  held in Nara, Japan from November
              16-21, 1997.  The co-  organizers are Professors John Malngailis of the
              University  of Maryland and Kenji Gamo of Osaka University in Japan.  This
              seminar will address a broad range of topics related to  ion beams and their
              application to materials processing,  including ion sources and optics, ion
              beam irradiation  effects, nanofabrication, application of focused ion beams 
              to maskless device processing, and the use of ion beams for  microanalysis. 
              %%%  Focused ion beams are now widely used in the integrated  circuits industry
              for precisely sectioning individual  components in integrated circuits during
              failure analysis,  for rewiring integrated circuits during the prototyping 
              phase, and for repair of masks.  As minimum dimensions in  integrated circuits
              shrink, significant advances will be  needed for ion microbeams to continue to
              serve these  functions.  In addition, present research may lead to new 
              applications in micromachining and semiconductor devise  fabrication. The main
              practical developments in the area of  finely focused ion beams have occurred
              in the United States  and Japan.  This seminar brings together researchers from
               both universities and industry.  The exchange of ideas and  data with Japanese
              experts in this field will enable U.S.  participants to advance their own work,
              and will set the  stage for future collaborative projects.  ***
