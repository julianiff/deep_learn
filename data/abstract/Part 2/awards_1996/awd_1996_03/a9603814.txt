Abstract    :
              9603814  He  During co-evolution of plants and their pathogens, plants have
              developed specific detection systems to detect pathogen presence by recognizing
              factors, products of co-called avr genes, whose recognition by the plant leads
              to responses.  The model for Avr proteins often assumes that they are
              extracellular ligands and that the plants defense gene products are cell
              surface receptors.  However, the model is not sufficiently supported by data. 
              The work will address the recognition problem.  Pseudomonas AvrB expressed
              inside a plant cell can trigger the pathogen response.  Experiments will
              identify the intracellular receptor to which AvrB binds, and identify the
              low-molecular weight elicitor which is produced by the action of AvrB in
              transgenic plants.
