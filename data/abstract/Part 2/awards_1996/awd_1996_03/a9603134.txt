Abstract    :
              ***  9603134  Knaff    This two-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              in plant biochemistry involves   the research grouping of David Knaff at Texas
              Tech University and Jean-Pierre Jacquot at   the Institute for Biotechnology of
              Plants, University of Paris, South, Paris, France.  The   objective of the
              research is to investigate the ferredoxin/thioredoxin light activation system  
              in chloroplast of higher plants and of the green alga Chlamydomonas
              reinhardtii.  They   will also study their target enzymes.  The U.S.
              investigators bring to this collaboration   their expertise in biochemistry. 
              This is complemented by the French investigators   expertise in molecular
              biology.  It takes advantage of cDNAs produced by the French   group and will
              be used in the studies.  The proposal advances fundamental understanding   of
              the proteins that are subject to light/dark modulation.  ***
