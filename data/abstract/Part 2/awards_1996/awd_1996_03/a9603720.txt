Abstract    :
                   Steroid hormones derived from the gonads or the adrenals, have  long been
              known to have profound effects on cellular and organismal  function.  The
              classical mechanism by which these hormones affect  cellular function is by
              interacting with intracellular receptors,  which upon binding translocate to
              the nucleus of the cell and alter  gene expression.  However, recent
              physiological experiments have  revealed that steroid hormones also bind to
              membrane-rich cellular  fractions and exert rapid effects on neuronal cells. 
              Dr. Ramirez  is isolating and characterizing these binding sites able to elicit
               rapid changes in cellular function.  In these investigations, Dr.  Ramirez is
              using a brain library to isolate a cDNA clone for this  novel receptor and to
              characterize the encoded protein.  If  successful, the research supported by
              this SGER award will greatly  change our understanding of steroid hormone
              action in the brain and  open an entire new field of scientific investigation
              in the  neurosciences.
