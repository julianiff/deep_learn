Abstract    :
                9603138  Zeng      This award supports a three year cooperative program on 
              fluid nucleation between Xiao Zeng, University of Nebraska,  and Wang Wenchuan
              and Gu Guangtu, Beijing University of  Chemical Technology.  The project
              involves participation of  two graduate students from Nebraska, who will visit
              China to  participate in the computation component of the research.    This
              project proposes to advance work funded under CTS  9413301 to develop a
              nucleation theory based on statistical  mechanics which would agree with the
              experimental facts  previously unexplained by other nucleation theories. The 
              nucleation theory to be developed in this project has  relevance to the
              formation of hazardous aerosols,  photochemical smog, acid rain and in other
              areas of  environmental science. The proposed collaboration involves  work on
              the theoretical aspects of the program at Nebraska,  and work on the
              computation component of the research in  Beijing. The project will be
              supported on the Chinese side  by the National Natural Science Foundation of
              China.
