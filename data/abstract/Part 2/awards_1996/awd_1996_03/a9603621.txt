Abstract    :
              Barbehenn  9603621         Oxidative stress is caused by reactive oxygen species
               (ROS), such as free radicals.  The consequences of ROS in  herbivorous insects
              range from no effect, in well-protected  species, to reduced growth or death,
              in species that are  less well protected.  The ingestion of prooxidant 
              chemicals  in plants can greatly exacerbate the production of ROS.  Research on
              the ways insects are protected from ROS has  focused on the role of
              antioxidative enzymes in the gut  tissues, rather than on mechanisms that may
              exist in the  lumen of the gut.  This work is designed to determine the 
              effectiveness of defenses that may exist in the gut lumen,  where ROS are first
              formed.  The investigators will test a  general hypothesis that the detrimental
              effects of  prooxidants on susceptible insects are the results of  ineffective
              defenses against ROS generated in the gut  lumens, whereas well-protected
              insects have effective  defenses against  ROS in their gut lumens.  The
              importance  of this work lies, in part, in developing a better  understanding
              of the different antioxidative strategies of  herbivorous insects that enable
              them to feed on "toxic"  plants.
