Abstract    :
                  Etkin  9603948      Cytoplasmic retention is an important regulatory step
              controlling the function of nuclear proteins. It is a universal phenomenon
              occurring in a variety of systems from yeast to man and regulating the
              comDartmentalkation of proteins during the cell cycle, different stages of
              differentiation, and sDecHic stages of development. During development
              cytoplasmic retention was observed with the dorsal gene product in Drosophila
              (Govind and Steward, 1992) and the late shifting maternal proteins in Xenopus
              (Dreyer et al., 1983; Miller et al., 1989,1991).         Dr. Etkin is analyzing
              one of the late shifting proteins, Xenopus nuclear factor 7 (xnf7), which
              originates in the oocyte nucleus (GV) and is retained in the cytoplasm until it
              enters the nucleus at the mid blastula transition (MBT) (Miller et al.,
              1989,1991; Reddy et al.,1991). Xnf7 is a member of a novel zinc finger gene
              family consisting of protoonconenes and transcription factors (Ready and Etkin,
              1991; Reddy et al., 1992; Freemont, 1993) and was recently shown to function in
              the dorsaVventral patterning of the embryo (El-Hodiri et al, submitted). Li et
              al (1994a) demonstrated the presence of a 22 amino acid cytoplasmic retention
              domain (CRD) that requires the phosphorylation of two phosphorylation sites
              (sites 1 and 2) to function in the cytoplasmic retention of xnf7 (Shou et al.,
              1996). Dr. Etkin has also shown that cytoplasmic retention of xnf7 most likely
              involves an anchor mechanism (Li et al.,1994a) and that the protein exists in a
              670kD Drotein complex consisting of xnf7 and two other proteins (Shou et al.,
              1996; Kuang, Che, Elhodiri and Etkin, unpublished). His hypothesis is that the
              retention of xnf7 in the cytoplasm prior to the MBT is the result of
              phosphorylation of site 1 and site 2 by specific kineses that influence the
              interaction of the CRD with a cytoplasmic anchor complex. In the present
              proposal he outlined a series of experimental approaches aimed testing this
              hypothesis and characterizing the compon ents of the anchor complex by
              addressing the following specific aims: 1.To identify the kineses that
              phosphorylate sites 1 and 2 which regulate cytoplasmic retention; 2. To
              identify xnf7 interacting proteins (XIP) using both biochemical and genetic
              approaches; 3.To perform a functional anaTysis of the XIP proteins. He believes
              that the analysis of this phenomenon using xnf7 as a model will serve as a
              paradigm for understanding the basic principles of the cytoplasmic retention
              mechanism in many systems. In addition, identification of the protein kineses
              that regulate the CRD function in retention will reveal the nature of the
              signal transduction pathways regulating this process. This will be important in
              integrating cytoplasmic retention of xnf7 with other biological processes such
              as axial patterning and cell cycle regulation which are also controlled through
              signal transduction pathways.
