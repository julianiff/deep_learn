Abstract    :
              9603956  Ortega  The growth of fungal sporangiophores, large single cells that
              are amenable to manipulation, is influenced by external factors, for example
              light and temperature.  These cells represent an ideal system to study single
              cell development.  Dr. Ortega is a biophysicist and has described the growth of
              these cells by a set of parameters, resulting in a set of "augmented growth
              equations" which were then studied by pressure probe measurements.    The
              proposal concentrates on the elucidation of mechanisms that control helical
              growth of elongating sporangiophores.  The work includes pressure probe
              measurements during growth, and analysis of microfibril orientation and
              slippage of fibrils.  The work is strongly based on mathematical models and
              relies on experimental data mainly to gauge the veracity of theoretical
              considerations.  The value of the work lies in the analysis of a simple model
              system that can provide a model for the more complex cell wall growth
              characteristics of plant cells.
