Abstract    :
              IBN-9603542  Baas    Neurons are the principal cells that make up the nervous 
              system.  They  consist of a rounded cell body and two types of elongate 
              extensions.  One  type of extension is called an axon while the other type is 
              called a  dendrite.  Axons are specialized to transmit information,  while
              dendrites  are specialized to receive information.  In order for the  neuron to
              extend  axons and dendrites, it must elaborate within them complex  arrays of 
              cytoskeletal elements.  These cytoskeletal elements provide  architectural 
              support for axons and dendrites, and also act as railways  for the transport 
              of substances from the cell body down their lengths.  One of  the most 
              important of the cytoskeletal elements is the microtubule.  The microtubule  is
              an intrinsically polar structure, and as a result of this  polarity, the 
              microtubule can direct the types of substances that are  transported into 
              axons and dendrites.  Fundamental to the differentiation of  axons and 
              dendrites is the establishment of very different microtubule  arrays in each 
              type of process.  Axonal and dendritic microtubules differ  in many respects, 
              including how they are organized relative to their polarity.  The axonal 
              microtubule array has been extensively studied, but the  dendritic  microtubule
              array has received far less attention.  The  overall goal of this  grant
              application is to elucidate the cellular and molecular  means by which  the
              dendritic microtubule array is established, and how it  becomes different  from
              the axonal microtubule array.  The proposed experiments  involve direct 
              observations within living neurons as well as high  resolution studies using 
              the electron microscope.
