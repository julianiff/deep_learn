Abstract    :
              9603552  Bradshaw  Part 1 Technical   The International Congress in Biochemistry
              and Molecular Biology, a forum for discussion of advances in this topic area by
              scientists coming from around the world has been the major event of the field,
              and has been in operation for nearly 50 years.  This year, USA is invited to
              serve as the host. It will be held August 24 - 29, in San Francisco, followed
              by a post conference meeting in Asilomar, California. The congress this year is
              organized in a format of 36 symposia, 12 of three-day duration and 24 of
              two-day duration.  The two-day symposia are divided into two equal sections
              with unique time slots such that an individual can attend all of the lectures. 
              The program includes areas of interest in enzymatic mechanisms and catalysis,
              protein folding, molecular design, receptors and signal transduction,
              signaling, regulation, intracellular sorting and trafficking, replication,
              recombination and repair, genome analysis, bioenergetics, protein turn over,
              macromolecular modification, ribozyme, and others.  The topics have been
              selected and scheduled to allow a flow from three-day symposia to those in the
              ensuing two-day symposia.  The design is to allow participants to remain highly
              focused, as is appropriate for individuals with very distinct and specialized
              interests, or one can attend a broad spectrum of lectures, as befits a
              generalist. The support will be used to help defray costs for approximately 30
              young scientists from USA to attend one or both of these venues.    Part 2. 
              Non technical  The International Congress in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

              with many areas of interest from basic to applied biochemistry and molecular
              biology included.  The topics have been selected and scheduled to allow a flow
