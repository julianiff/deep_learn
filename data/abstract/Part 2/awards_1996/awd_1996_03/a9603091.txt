Abstract    :
              ***  9603091  Stahl    This two-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              in cellular biology involves   Phillip Stahl at Washington University and
              Michel Vidal at the University of Montpellier   II.  The award provides travel
              support and living expenses to Dr. Stahl and a postdoctoral   researcher.  The
              objective of the research is to investigate the mechanism by which rab5, a  
              low molecular weight GTPase (enzyme) regulates endocytosis and phagocytosis. 
              These   are processes by which cells bind and internalize nutrients,
              biologically active peptides and   toxins, substances and particles.  The U.S.
              investigators bring to this collaboration   expertise in in vitro endosome and
              phagosome fusion.  This is complemented by the   French investigator's
              experience with exotoxins.  ***
