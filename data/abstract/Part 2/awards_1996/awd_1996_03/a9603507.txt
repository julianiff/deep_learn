Abstract    :
                This two-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in population biology
              involves   Jay Hestbeck of the University of Massachusetts, Kenneth Pollack of
              North Carolina State   University, and the research group led by Roger Pradel
              at the Centre d'Ecologie   Fonctionnelle et Evolution in Montpellier, France. 
              The objective of their research is to   estimate and model recruitment of young
              animals within a metapopulation system.  The   ecological setting involves
              multiple locations where adult animals reproduce and among   which adults may
              move.  Young animals undergo a period of maturation during which   they must
              survive and possibly move to a different location to enter the breeding  
              population as an adult.   Current studies and models for population dynamics do
              not   include this dispersal component.  Through the combined efforts of these
              two   complementary research groups, new models will be developed that include
              animal   dispersal.
