Abstract    :
              9603893  Butler  The goal of this research is to understand the role of
              polyadenlyation in eukaryotic mRNA biogenesis and function.  This goal will be
              achieved by characterizing defects in poly(A) function and by identifying and
              characterizing specific classes of new mutations that affect the mechanism and
              function of polyadenylation in yeast.  Dominant negative mutations of the gene
              encoding poly(A) polymerase will be identified, characterized and used to study
              the mechanism and function of polyadenylation in vitro and in vivo.  New mRNA
              3'-end processing mutants will be selected using a recently developed system to
              identify temperature sensitive mutations that cause defects in mRNA 3'-end
              processing.  These mutations also will be characterized in vitro and in vivo
              and the corresponding normal genes cloned by complementation.  %%%   
              Modification of most eukaryotic messenger RNAs by addition of polyadenylic acid
              or poly(A) to the RNA 3'-end is essential for normal mRNA synthesis and
              function.  The goal of this research is to understand the role of
              polyadenlyation in normal eukaryotic mRNA biogenesis and function.  This goal
              will be achieved by characterizing defects in poly(A) function and by
              identifying and characterizing specific classes of new mutations that affect
              the mechanism and function of polyadenylation in yeast.  ***
