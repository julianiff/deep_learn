Abstract    :
              9603216  Hungerford    This award supports a three-year collaborative research 
              project between Professor Ed V. Hungerford of the University  of Houston and
              Professor Osamu Hashimoto of Tohoku  University in Sendai, Japan.  The
              researchers will undertake  an investigation of light hypernuclei by pion,
              kaon, and  photon beams.  The goal of the collaboration is to  selectively
              study S=-1 and -2 light hypernuclei.  They will  concentrate their
              investigation on those aspects of  hypernuclear physics which better elucidate
              unsolved  problems in hadronic many-body physics.    This collaboration
              requires close working relations between  theorists and experimentalists, which
              has been one of the  traditional strengths of this field.  The researchers plan
               to take advantage of the fact that a number of new  experimental facilities
              have just been, or will soon be  commissioned, for the study of nuclei embedded
              with strange  hyperons.  These facilities should provide new, more precise 
              information thus anticipating a major advance in this field.  Through the
              exchange of ideas and technology, this project  will broaden our base of basic
              knowledge and promote  international understanding and cooperation.  ***
