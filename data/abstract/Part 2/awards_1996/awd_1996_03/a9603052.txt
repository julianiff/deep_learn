Abstract    :
              INT 9603052  Szyld      This U.S.-Czech mathematics workshop on iterative
              methods and parallel computations will be held in the Czech Republic at Milovy,
              during the week of June 16, 1997.  The U.S. organizer, Dr. Daniel Szyld of
              Temple University, will work with Czech counterpart, Dr. Ivo Marek of Charles
              University, with the intent of bringing together scientists and engineers from
              academia and industry to examine questions pertaining to iterative methods,
              numerical linear algebra, and related efficiencies in parallel implementation
              of numerical methods.  It is hoped that fruitful exchange among participants at
              the workshop will lead to new U.S.-Czech cooperative research activities in
              mathematics and computer science, with long-term potential for applications in
              supercomputing and engineering topics such as ground water flow simulation.   
              This mathematics workshop fulfills the program objective of advancing
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of
              strong mutual interest and competence.       ??
