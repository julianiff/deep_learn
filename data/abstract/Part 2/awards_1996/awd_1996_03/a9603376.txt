Abstract    :
              9603376  Burton    This proposal describes an evaluation effort to determine
              whether the introduction of network-based computing supporting education reform
              and whether that correlates positively with increases in community-school
              interaction, and teacher training modelled after Statewide Systemic Initiatives
              (SSI). We seek to determine the extent to which networking facilitates
              community involvement and increases support for education reform, as well as
              those factors that affect organizational change that supports or inhibits
              reform.    In order to allocate human and capital resources optimally for
              education reform, we need rich, generalizable evidence of the circumstances
              under which reforms achieve maximum effectiveness. Currently, little is known
              from more than an anecdotal perspective, about the effectiveness of network
              applications, including community-school interactions, in combination with
              constructivist teaching styles and strategies. To evaluate these combined
              effects, we will conduct structured interviews, surveys, and focus groups with
              teachers, students, administrators and community members at three school
              districts in Virginia. The participating sites are selected on the basis of
              their commitment to the Statewide Systemic Initiative (SSI) in Virginia,
              VQuest, and to networking applications in the classroom and with the community,
              as well as overall project goals.  ***
