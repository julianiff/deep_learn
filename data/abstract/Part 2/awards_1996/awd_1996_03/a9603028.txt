Abstract    :
              9603028  Idriss    This award supports the participation of American scientists 
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Soil Behavior and Ground Response  for Hazard
              Assessment During Earthquakes to be held in  Hokkaido, Japan from July 1-2,
              1997.  The co-organizers are  Professors I. M. Idriss of the University of
              California at  Davis and Kenji Ishihara of the Science University of Tokyo  in
              Japan.  This seminar will provide a forum for bringing  together up-to-date
              information on 1) liquefaction in  cohesionless soils, 2) the failure of
              cohesive soils, and 3)  the response of soil sites underlain by layers of soft 
              cohesive soils or layers that  tend to liquefy when subjected  to shaking.   
              Ground failure during earthquakes, as caused by liquefaction  in cohesionless
              soils and over-stressing of cohesive soils,  results in major damage to ports
              and harbors, buildings,  bridges, and other civil infrastructure facilities. 
              Gaining  an understanding of liquefaction in sandy soils and failure  in
              cohesive soils subjected to earthquakes is an important  first step in
              developing design guidelines to mitigate the  damages of earthquakes.  Natural
              disaster reduction is a  priority area for U.S.-Japan Cooperation.  The
              exchange of  ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will  enable
              U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will  set the stage for future
              collaborative projects.  ***
