Abstract    :
              Abstract    Solomonson  9603476    This is an award to support attendance of
              young investigators at a meeting to be held May 4-9, 1997 on the campus of the
              University of South Florida in Tampa.  The topic of the meeting is "Nitrogen
              Assimilation: Molecular and Genetic Aspects".  This meeting will bring together
              microbiologists and plant biologists to discuss a variety of topics relating to
              nitrogen fixation and nitrate assimilation.  The program includes topics from
              chemical to ecological.  Participants will have the opportunity to meet
              informally to discuss their work as well as attend formal lectures.
