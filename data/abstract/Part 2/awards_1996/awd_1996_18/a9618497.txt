Abstract    :
                   With funding from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic  
              Chemistry  program, Professor Clark Landis of the University of   Wisconsin,
              Madison will  undertake the development of new computational   and experimental
              tools for elucidation of solution structures of   organometallic molecules. 
              Valence bond, molecular mechanics and ensemble   calculations will be used to
              model transition-metal catalysts and their   reaction pathways.  2D NMR studies
              will be used to correlate the   theoretical models with the structures and
              reactivities of the molecules   in solution.        New methods for the
              determination of structures of transition metal   organometallic molecules in
              solution will be studied.  The computational   methods developed will allow for
              the determination of structures using   molecular mechanics methods that are
              specifically tailored to include   parameters for transition metals.  While
              such calculations are widely   used for small organic molecules and proteins,
              the inclusion of   transition metals requires the development of new parameters
              to describe   the force fields around the metal atoms.   Consequently, these  
              calculations are still emerging in their ability to computationally model   the
              structures of organometallic molecules.  Algorithms derived from this   work
              will be made readily accessible to other researchers, who are   expected to use
              them to understand catalytic activity and shape   interactions involving
              transition metal ions.
