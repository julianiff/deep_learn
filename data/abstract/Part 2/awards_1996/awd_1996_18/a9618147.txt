Abstract    :
              9618147    Oltman-Shay    The PIs hypothesize that the group structure of wind
              waves  generates infragravity waves (0.005 to 0.05 Hz) in a natural surf  zone.
               In this project they will investigate the dynamical  importance of the
              wind-wave-group structure by analyzing existing  field data to determine the
              vertical velocity structure, and  particularly the vertical velocity variance
              in the infragravity  wave velocity field.
