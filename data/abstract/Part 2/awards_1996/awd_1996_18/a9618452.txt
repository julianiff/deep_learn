Abstract    :
                9618452  Chang      This is a 12 month award proposed by Drs. George C.C.
              Chang  and Chung Yun Chang, the University of Maryland,  collaborating with
              Drs. P.K. Deng and Shih-Chang Lee,  Academia Sinica in Taiwan, and sixteen
              other researchers  from the Taiwan National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan 
              University, Nanjing University (China), Institute of High  Energy Physics of
              Chinese Academy of Science.   Drs.George  C.C. Chang and Chung Yun Chang
              request funds for travel and  communication to carry out the pilot experiment
              on neutrino  oscillation using anti-neutrino particles generated by the  Taiwan
              nuclear power plants.   neutrino is one of the  elementary particles in
              particle and astro-physics. Neutrino  oscillation may provide the information
              for many fundamental  questions in physics, such as whether neutrinos have
              finite  masses or different masses for different neutrino flavor  transitions. 
                This study addresses a very important fundamental question  in physics.  The
              Taiwan National Science Council will  provide $200,000 for the first year of
              this experiment and  one million dollars per year for next four years if the 
              initial  experiment proves to be promising.    It is an  exploratory project
              with potential major scientific payoff.  The majority of the laboratory and
              research cost will be  provided by the Taiwan National Science Council and the 
              Taiwan Power Company.  If successful, experimental results  may lead to answers
              to questions on fundamental properties  of neutrinos and to cosmological
              puzzles such as the deficit  of solar neutrinos and the properties of dark
              matter.  The  project is jointly supported by the Taiwan National Science 
              Council and the NSF.  ***
