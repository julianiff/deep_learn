Abstract    :
              SBR-9618343  Chakravorty, Sanjoy  Temple University    This award supports
              research on the spatial dimensions of structural reform in India.  A set of
              hypotheses are posed which suggests the geographic impacts of sweeping policy
              reforms.  These acknowledge the disengagement of the nation-state from
              investment location decisions and regulations, and at the same time the greater
              independence of and competition between sub-national states.  A novel
              hypothesis will examine the internal restructuring of the metropolis to
              accommodate new growth impulses.  The hypotheses will be tested using spatially
              and sectorally disaggregated data on investment from the pre-reform and
              post-reform periods.  Three spatial scales will be used: interstate with
              nationwide coverage, intra-state for the seven leading urban-industrial states
              and intra-metropolis for the leading agglomerations.  The data will be analyzed
              using a variety of spatial techniques.  These include exploratory spatial data
              analysis, clustering techniques and the use of mixed regressive-spatial
              autoregressive models.  The research has important theoretical and policy
              implications in regards to the impact of liberalization efforts throughout the
              Third World.
