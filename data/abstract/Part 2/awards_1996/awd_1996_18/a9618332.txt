Abstract    :
                Cowan, John  AST 96-18332    Dr. Cowan will continue research into the
              formation, evolution, and age of the heavy elements,   with particular emphasis
              on the formation of the neutron capture s- and r-process elements.  His  
              research utilizes a dynamic r-process code, which incorporates the most current
              nuclear data, in   combination with observational data for the most metal-poor
              stars of the Galactic halo.  His   theoretical studies will define the
              environments, both nuclear and astrophysical, in which these   heavy elements
              were formed and provide insight into the conditions that existed early in the  
              history of the Galaxy and into the nature of the progenitors of the halo stars.
               Closely related   efforts to investigate the r- and s-process production as a
              function of stellar metallicity will offer   constraints on early Galactic
              timescales for stellar formation.  Dr. Cowan will also continue   studies of
              the use of long-lived radioactive chronometers (especially Th and U) and the  
              development of more realistic chemical evolution models to provide more
              accurate estimates of   the age of the Galaxy, and constrain cosmological age
              estimates.  ***
