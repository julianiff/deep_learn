Abstract    :
              9618787  Jacobs  Spectrum-slicing provides an attractive low-cost alternative to
              the use of multiple coherent lasers for wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)
              applications by utilizing spectral slices of a single broadband noise source
              for the different data channels.  This two-year research program is for the
              analysis, design, and performance evaluation of optical fiber spectrum-sliced
              WDM systems.  ***
