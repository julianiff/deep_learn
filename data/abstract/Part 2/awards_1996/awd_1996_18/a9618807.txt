Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Proposal Number:  9618807  Principal Investigator:  R. Madix 
              Institution:  Stanford University    A better understanding of the reactivity
              of supported metal oxide catalysts is sought.  The model catalyst selected is
              vanadium oxide deposited on titanium oxide single crystals.  The deposition is
              to be done from the vapor or alternatively from aqueous solutions.  Growth
              morphology and structure will be studied by STM and LEED; electronic structure
              by UPS, XPS and EELS; reactivity by TPD and oxidation reactions of probe
              molecules.
