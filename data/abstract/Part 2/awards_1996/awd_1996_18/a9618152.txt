Abstract    :
              Since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of managed exchange rates in the
              early 1970's, there have been large and persistent movements in the nominal
              exchange rates between the currencies of the United States, Japan, and the
              countries of Western Europe.  These movements in nominal exchange rates have
              been much larger than the inflation, money growth, or interest rate
              differentials across these countries.  Moreover, at all but very low
              frequencies, these movements in nominal exchange rates are associated with
              movements in real exchange rates of roughly the same size and persistence.  The
              purpose of this research is to develop new approaches to modeling this behavior
              of exchange rates and their impact on international business cycles.   The 
              project consists of three parts.  The first involves analyzing whether a model
              used to assess the impact of monetary injections on asset prices can reproduce
              the salient features of exchange rate behavior.  The second part involves
              analyzing the impact of monetary policy on interest rates, exchange rates, the
              terms of trade, and the trade balance using an international business cycle
              model with segmented asset markets.  The third part develops a search model to
              analyze the pricing decisions of multinational firms that produce in a single
              location and sell their products to segmented goods markets.
