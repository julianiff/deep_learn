Abstract    :
                    9618099  Lipka    The University of Alaska Fairbanks in collaboration with
              a Yup'ik teacher group,  Ciulistet  Leaders , and Yup'ik elders will develop 15
              ancillary modules or prekindergarten through sixth grade mathematics
              curriculum.  These modules, which are developed from Yup'ik Eskimo culture,
              language, and everyday practice, connect the embedded mathematics in Yup'ik
              culture to Western mathematics.  These modules will conform to the Curriculum
              and Evaluation Standards  of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. 
              Previously, this team developed math manipulative prototypes (the Yup'ik math
              Tool Kit) based on Yup'ik language and culture.  The Yup'ik Math Tool Kit takes
              advantage of Yup'ik conceptions of numeration, nonstandard measures, and
              patterns.  This tool kit will be refined and will form an integral part of this
              inquiry-based approach to teaching mathematics.  The team plans to develop
              computer software that children can use to copy, identify, analyze, and create
              Yup'ik patterns.    This four-year project is designed to serve a historically
              underrepresented group, indigenous Alaskan students, by linking mathematics
              with their culture.  This project will also provide these contextually rich
              mathematics problems to an audience well beyond the state of Alaska, with the
              intent of being national in its appeal.  To accomplish this, the project team
              will pilot and field test the modules in Alaska among school districts with an
              almost 100% indigenous population and outside of Alaska.  Lastly, the
              curriculum development team will form a partnership with the Alaska Rural
              Systemic Initiative in developing this curriculum and in providing teacher
              enhancement.
