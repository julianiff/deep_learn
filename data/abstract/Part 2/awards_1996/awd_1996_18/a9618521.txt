              LORENZ ABSTRACT    This award supports the research of Professor Martin Lorenz
              in  the area of noncommutative ring theory with particular emphasis  on the
              structure of rings of invariants arising from actions of  finite groups and
              finite dimensional Hopf algebras.  The main objectives will be the description
              of the Grothendieck  groups G_0 and K_0 of these rings, the continued
              development  of the representation theory of finite dimensional Hopf algebras, 
              and the detailed analysis of invariant rings of multiplicative  group actions
              on Laurent polynomial rings.    Invariant theory and representation theory of
              groups are classical  algebraic themes that are ubiquitous in pure mathematics
              and are  indispensable in parts of applied mathematics and physics as well. 
              Both are formally subsumed in the theory of Hopf algebras, more  recent
              algebraic structures with a wide range of applications. In  recognition of
              their relevance in physics, certain types of Hopf  algebras are referred to as
              quantum groups. Hopf algebras further  naturally arise in knot theory, an area
              of particular interest to  molecular chemists as well as physicists.
