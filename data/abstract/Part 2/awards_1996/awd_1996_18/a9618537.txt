Abstract    :
                Phinney, E. Sterl  AST 96-18537    Dr. Phinney will carry out a program of
              theoretical research on a diverse array of topics related   by the general
              theme of the physics of compact objects and magnetic fields in young galaxies. 
                His research program has three major goals : 1) to investigate the ways in
              which binary stars can   interact with each other through both gravitational
              and non-gravitational forces, 2) to improve   understanding of the ways in
              which pulsars lose energy and the properties of their winds and  
              magnetospheres, and 3) to develop techniques for determining the origin of the
              magnetic fields in   galaxies and clusters.    ***
