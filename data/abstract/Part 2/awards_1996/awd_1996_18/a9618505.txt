Abstract    :
                Ayres, Thomas  AST 96-18505    Dr. Ayres continues his program of research
              into the presence of cold gas in the solar and stellar   atmospheres.  He will
              take advantage of new instrumentation available for imaging and   spectroscopy
              in the IR to 1) explore the temporal evolution of the dynamic, inhomogeneous
              solar   surface, 2) investigate the behavior of CO bands at 4.7 microns as a
              function of Teff, log g,   metallicity, and chromospheric activity in a survey
              of late-type stars, and 3) model the   inhomogeneous outer atmosphere of the
              sun with 3-D geometries and extrapolate the results to   stars.    ***
