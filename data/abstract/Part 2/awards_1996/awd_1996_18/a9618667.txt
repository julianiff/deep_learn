Abstract    :
              9618667  McDUFF  This project will supply shipboard scientific equipment for the
                 research vessel C.A BARNES, operated by the University of  Washington,
              School of Oceanography and dedicated to use in support  of ocean science
              research.    The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds 
              for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct  of ocean
              science research. This Program provides support for such  items as deck
              equipment including winch systems for the deployment  and retrieval of
              scientific instruments, navigational equipment  such as radars, gyroscopes and
              earth satellite receivers to pin  point the location of research sites,
              communication equipment  including radio transceivers and satellite
              transceivers for voice  and scientific data communications and other equipment
              such as  motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data 
              retrieval sites.    The Project Director, Russell E. McDuff is fully qualified
              to  direct this project having had considerable experience in  overseeing the
              acquisition and installation of shipboard  equipment.      This project will
              allow the institution to acquire two small  winches, two storage vans, a
              deionization unit for laboratory water  and two computers for the THOMPSON. 
              The THOMPSON's radar,  navigational computer and habitability will be upgraded
              and the  BARNES will acquire a new radar.  ***
