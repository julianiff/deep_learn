              AST-9618852      This grant supports the upgrade of an adaptive optics 
              facility to be used with several of the telescopes on Mauna  Kea. A 36 actuator
              adaptive mirror will replace the 13  actuator mirror of the prototype system. 
              The upgrade will  also provide the system with a capability for using infrared 
              guide stars, a coronographic facility, and an infrared  camera.
