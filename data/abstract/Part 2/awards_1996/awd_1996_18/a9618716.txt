Abstract    :
              9618716  GOAD     This project will supply shipboard scientific support
              equipment    for the research vessel LAURENTIAN operated by the University of 
              Michigan, Center for Great Lakes & Aquatic Sciences, and    dedicated to use in
              support of ocean science research.              The Shipboard Scientific
              Support Equipment Program provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential
              to the proper and safe     conduct of ocean science research. This Program
              provides support   for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for
              the   deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational  
              equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite      receivers to pin
              point the location of research sites,      communication equipment including
              radio transceivers and      satellite transceivers for voice and scientific
              data      communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats    for
              transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.         The Project
              Director, Dr. Linda Goad is fully qualified to direct  this project having had
              considerable experience in overseeing the  acquisition and installation of
              shipboard equipment.              This project will allow the institution to
              reduce engine room  noise, and upgrade safety equipment.  ***
