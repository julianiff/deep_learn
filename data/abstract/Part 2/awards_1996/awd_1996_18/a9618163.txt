Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Howard Reiss  of the Department of Chemistry of  the University   of
              California, Los Angeles  will study the molecular theory of vapor   phase
              nucleation and related topics. This research comprises three   related
              projects:(1) The molecular theory of vapor phase nucleation,   aimed at the
              prediction of nucleation rates for Argon. (2) The length   scale for
              configurational entropy  for  microemulsions and nucleation   will be studied
              and scaling laws will be formulated.(3) Thermodynamic   properties of hard
              particle systems using the available space function.   The formulation of a
              coherent and consistent theory of nucleation has   important consequences for
              many practical applications to atmospheric   science, to microemulsions,
              polymers and other colloidal systems. Prof.    Reiss has been one of the
              leaders in this field and his proposed work   will be of equal importance.
