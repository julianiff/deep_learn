Abstract    :
              9618058  Thiel    This is a three-year project to create a series of 
              microbiologically-based modules with appropriate instructional  materials for
              teachers.  The high quality instructional materials  are to reflect a
              real-world focus and relate to the industrial  applications of biology.  One
              goal of this proposal is to make  science accessible and interesting to all
              high school students,  regardless of their academic abilities or career goals. 
              A primary  objective is to involve academic and industrial scientists with 
              educators in the development of an innovative, real-world science  program
              designed to engage high school students, especially from  historically
              underrepresented groups, in the process of scientific  inquiry.  The eight
              modules are designed to be used in life science  classes to teach fundamental
              concepts of biology.  This hands-on  curriculum with a science, technology, and
              society focus, is to be  developed as a collaborative effort between secondary
              school  teachers, university scientists and science educators, and 
              microbiology consultants from St. Louis-based industries.
