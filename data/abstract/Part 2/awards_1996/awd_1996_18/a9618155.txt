Abstract    :
              This project's main objective is to make accurate photoabsorption cross sections
              of molecular nitrogen and oxygen in the wavelength region 80-105 nm.  This
              region absorbs solar radiation between 100 and 240 km, and is the primary
              source of physical processes such as excitation, dissociation, and ionization. 
              To completely understand basic principles of atmospheric processes, the PI will
              study how the solar flux is absorbed by thermospheric molecules.  He will
              accurately determine photoabsorption cross sections in the laboratory under
              conditions representative of the atmospheric region where the absorption
              occurs.
