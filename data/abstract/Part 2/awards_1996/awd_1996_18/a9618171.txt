Abstract    :
              `Worldviews, Ethnicity, and Risk Perception `  PI proposes a study of the
              differences in risk perception among individuals  from different
              ethnic/cultural backgrounds who hold different `worldviews.`  The study will
              use Dake's measure of worldview, self-identification of  ethnicity, and
              Holtgrave and Weber's SCER (Simplified Conjoint Expected  Risk) model of risk
              perception.  The basic idea is to use the model to find  the locus of ethnic
              and worldview differences in risk perception. The research plan is to use four
              ethnic groups (Taiwanese,African-American, Hispanic of Mexican origin, and
              European-American), and to obtain equal numbers in each ethnic group who most
              strongly endorse each of three worldviews (authoritarian, egalitarian, and
              individualistic). Subjects will fill out a risk questionnaire involving
              financial and health risks.  Some of the risks to be judged involve genetic
              testing, an area of  expertise for the PI.  There will be two versions of the
              risk questionnaire: (a) subjects will rate all the theoretical variables for
              the SCER model for each risk, or (b) subjects will be given values for all the
              SCER variables for each risk in the form of lotteries.  The goal is to
              determine whether agreement between overall risk rating and the model variables
              is inflated by the procedure of rating the model variables.
