Abstract    :
              9618417  Mazumder  Uqing negative differential resistance (NDR) device
              technologies, researchers at the Univ. of Michigan will develop the theory of
              circuit design; b. design accurate and fast circuit models and algorithms, and
              c. study systems-level issues in the design of large computational and signal
              processing circuits.  Such NDR device technology may well supersede existing
              conventional microelectronic device technology as device dimensions and packing
              density requirements continually push the state-of-the-art.  ***
