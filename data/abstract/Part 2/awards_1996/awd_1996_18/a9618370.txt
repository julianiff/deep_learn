Abstract    :
              The 1990s have witnessed both a dramatic expansion of capital flows into
              developing economies-the emerging markets boom-and an equally dramatic
              contraction of such flows following the 1994-1995 financial crisis in Mexico.
              The purpose of this research is to construct intertemporal general equilibrium
              models both for analyzing the capital flows that would follow financial opening
              in developing economies and for analyzing financial crises like that in Mexico.
              Although much of the proposed research focuses on the case of Mexico, it is
              applicable far more widely.   This project will extend previous work by the
              author on modeling financial crises.  It will generalize this work on
              self-fulfilling debt crises to allow for consumers who have risk-averse
              preferences and who would borrow and lend internationally.  Preliminary results
              indicate that this extension will capture the capital flight that occurs when
              the probability of a debt crisis increased.  The research will also develop an
              alternative, but related, model of self-fulfilling currency crises.  The models
              of debt crises and those of currency crises will ultimately be linked through
              the crucial role that foreign reserves held by the government play in each
              model.  A central feature of the proposed crises models is that they will be
              fully specified dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium models, as contrasted
              with the reduced form models found in the literature.  In addition, a dynamic,
              stochastic general equilibrium model in which banking crises can occur in
              equilibrium will also be contracted and analyzed.
