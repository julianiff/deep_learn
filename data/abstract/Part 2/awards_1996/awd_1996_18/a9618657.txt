Abstract    :
              9618657  Scott    Support is provided for Russian and US scientists to discuss 
              their  research on rhenium alloys at the TMS  conference  in  Orlando,   FL, 
              in  the  spring  of  1997.   This  symposium  commemorates  the  70th 
              anniversary  of  the  discovery  of  rhenium.  The last symposium on the metal
              was held in  1960.  The   current   state  of  the  science,   technology,  
              and  application   of  rhenium  alloys  is  discussed   by   USSR  scientists
              and engineers and their counterparts in the  U.S.  and elsewhere.  The
              conference has 83 technical papers, in 8  sessions,  covering  history  of  the
               metal,  availability,  extraction, recycling, powder processing, sintering, 
              vacuum  melting,  physical metallurgy, thermomechanical  treatments,  near-net
              shape manufacturing, and welding.  %%%  The information developed at the
              conference is important  to  the  development of cost-effective processing, 
              application,  and recycling of rhenium alloys.  ***
