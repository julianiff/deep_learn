Abstract    :
              9618917  Knox  This award to University of California at San Diego will provide
              new instrumentation for oceanographic studies, new shipboard computers and new
              shipboard analytical instrumentation for use on the research vessels Revelle,
              Melville, New Horizon and Sproul, as well as on other vessels by the
              Oceanographic Data Facility.  These vessels are operated by Scripps Institution
              of Oceanography as part of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory
              System research fleet. The shared-use instrumentation supported here will
              assist ocean researchers conduct studies throughout the world ocean in 1997 and
              future years.  ***
