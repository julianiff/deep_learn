Abstract    :
              9618014  Weihnacht    MW Productions, a producer of educational multimedia is 
              collaborating with William Durham of Stanford University, to create  an
              interactive, educational CD-ROM based on the Galapagos Islands  to enhance
              7th-10th grade science.  The products are to include  self-directed and
              self-paced discovery in five specific areas: 1)  pattern and process in organic
              evolution, 2) the scientific method  of inquiry, 3) the history of science
              around the time of Charles  Darwin, 4) community ecology and conservation
              issues in Galapagos,  and 5) the geology and climatology of the Galapagos. 
              Using  Galapagos organisms, students explore examples of adaptation,  homology,
              natural selection, sexual selection, and co-evolution.   They discover certain
              aspects of human impact on the islands and  all this while learning of Darwin's
              own voyage of discovery around  the world on the R/V Beagle.  The main product
              from this project is  a CD-ROM on Mac platform that includes narrated video,
              animation,  science simulations, graphics, text and computer programming.  
              Additional materials are printed workbooks students use for  compiling of
              results and teachers to use for assessment of student  work, and a printed
              guide for teachers on content, pedagogical and  technical issues involved. 
              Content and pedagogy are to be aligned  with the National Science Education
              Standards.
