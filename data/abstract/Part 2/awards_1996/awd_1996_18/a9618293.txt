Abstract    :
                    OCE 9618293  Klinck    The objectives of the project are to obtain a
              dynamical  understanding of the circulation and water property  variations
              within steep sided canyons. Interaction of  canyons with the coastal
              circulation will also be  investigated. A three-phase approach will be used,
              combining  field observations, numerical modeling, and laboratory  experiments.
              Existing observations will be further analyzed  and used for initialization of
              model and lab simulations.  Simulations will concentrate on Astoria Canyon,
              where the  most extensive data exist. The principal issues to be  addressed are
              the relative importance of various flow  regimes, the dependence of the flow on
              forcing mechanisms,  and tidal effects.
