Abstract    :
              9618266  Glotzer    The Video Encyclopedia of Physics Demonstrations, previously
              funded, is well-regarded for use in high school and middle school physics and
              physical science classes.  It has been translated into other languages for use
              in other countries.  There have been requests to provide a Spanish/English
              edition to provide Hispanic students a tool to improve their science education,
              their scientific literacy, and their language skills.  There is evidence that
              supporting limited English proficient students with both primary and secondary
              language materials increases their academic understanding.  Professors and
              teachers of physics fluent in Spanish and in English do the intellectual work
              of translating narrations and accompanying written materials and supervising
              the recording and synchronization of the Spanish narrations.   Narrators are
              chosen by a committee of Spanish speaking high school and university educators
              to ensure that the accents of the narrators are universally understood. 
              Distribution will be through the Edgroup Publications.
