Abstract    :
              9618451  Cronin    This award supports planning visits to prepare for a 
              worldwide effort organized by Jim Cronin, University of  Chicago, to study the
              highest energy cosmic rays.  Plans in  the long run include collaboration in
              building two cosmic  ray observatories that will be equipped to study the
              highest  energy cosmic rays in order to understand how protons or  nuclei are
              accelerated to such high energies,  and to try to  determine the sources of
              those cosmic rays. This work is  expected to address one of the central
              problems in  astrophysics, the origin of cosmic rays.    Collaboration with
              Russian, Japanese and Vietnamese  scientists will take place under this grant. 
              Testing of  detectors essential to the project will take place in Japan,  with
              the participation of two University of Chicago  students. Exchanges of visits
              between Chicago and Dalat,  Vietnam will help initiate cooperation on computer 
              simulation of the detectors. A visit to Chicago by a key  Russian scientist
              will help define the potential for Russian  contribution of inexpensive
              photomultipliers to the project.
