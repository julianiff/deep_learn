Abstract    :
              If  "to  err  is  human," then understanding the origin,  nature,  detection, 
              and correction of errors should be an important  goal  for  those  engaged  in
              the study of human-computer  interaction.  There  are  many  ways in which we
              may err; the current  proposal  tackles one of the most modest, least studied,
              but most pervasive  types  of  human errors: errors in performing simple, 
              rule-based  tasks. Rule-based tasks include tasks such as getting money  from 
              an ATM, programming a VCR to record a show, or using a browser to  surf the
              web. Such tasks involve following a limited set of rules  (i.e.,  well
              described procedures) to achieve limited,  but  well  defined goals. They do
              not involve problem solving or creativity.  Though  seemingly  modest in terms
              of their  demands  upon  human  cognition, the prevalence of errors in such
              tasks seems  constant  and  high  even with experienced users. The increasing
              number  of  such  tasks  at home (e.g., programmable voice-mail, thermostats, 
              and bike odometers) and work (e.g., flight management computer on  advanced 
              commercial  aircraft, routine use  of  spreadsheets  or  databases,   and  
              email  systems)  suggests  that   an   indepth  understanding  of  errors  in 
              these  tasks  could  significantly  improve  the  design  of  many simple but 
              important  interactive  tools.
