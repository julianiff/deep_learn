Abstract    :
                Patterson, Joseph  AST 96-18545    Dr. Patterson continues the measurement of
              periodicities in cataclysmic binary systems through   an extensive
              observational program.  Photometric monitoring of cataclysmic variables to  
              determine rotational ephemerides and to characterize the phenomenon of
              superhumps is basic to   understanding the accretion processes and the
              long-term effect of accretion on periods and spin   rates. Patterson and his
              collaborators have established a network of small telescopes for   photometry
              and enlisted the observing support of amateurs world-wide who provide
              monitoring   of many systems in close collaboration with professional
              astronomers.   ***
