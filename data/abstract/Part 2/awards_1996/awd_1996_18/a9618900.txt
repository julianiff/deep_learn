Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program provides continued support for research on metal-metal   interactions
              by Dr. Dennis L. Lichtenberger of the Chemistry Department,   University of
              Arizona.   Systems under investigation contain quadruple   and triple
              metal-metal bonds, metal-metal configurations beyond   occupation of the
              anti-bonding delta orbital, and non-bonding and   weakly-associated
              through-space and through-ligand metal-metal   interactions.  The metal-metal
              complexes contain a variety of bridging   and non-bridging ligands and
              represent a broad range of electron-donating   and electron-withdrawing effects
              associated with key structural   perturbations.  Complexes with both weak and
              strong ligands coordinated   to the axial position are also included. 
              High-resolution HeI/HeII   valence and high precision X-ray core photoelectron
              spectroscopy will be   used to study both gas phase and condensed species.  The
              project includes   further development of instrumental capabilities. 
              Metal-metal interactions contribute to the structure, stability, and  
              reactivity of many species and influence important chemical, catalytic,   and
              materials processes.  Unique instrumentation will be developed to   provide
              detailed electronic structure information on these interactions
