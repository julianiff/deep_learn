Abstract    :
                This dissertation proposal examines aging, adult development, and
              intergenerational family dynamics among Copper Inuit in the Central Canadian
              Arctic community of Holman, Victoria Island.  The investigation focuses
              specifically on the attitudes toward and significance of aging in light of
              rapid social changes that Copper Inuit have experienced in the past 30-35
              years, the material position of aged Inuit (age 50 and over), and the
              importance of the aged, both economically and symbolically, to young adult
              Inuit in the community.
