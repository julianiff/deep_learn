              OCE-9618626                              ABSTRACT                               
                                             OCE-9618626           The isotopic composition
              of organic carbon in marine organic  matter in the modern ocean and in the
              sedimentary record has been  an  object  of  study for a number of years. 
              Variations  in  the  carbon-13/carbon-12  ratio  have variously  been 
              interpreted  as  arising from changes (or differences) in temperature, the 
              amount  of   dissolved  carbon  dioxide  in  seawater,  growth  rate  and 
              productivity  of  phytoplankton, among other possibilities.   The  phenomenon 
              is  not  only a major feature  of  present-day  ocean  chemistry   but, 
              moreover,  may  be  of  use  for  understanding  historical  variations in
              global carbon dioxide through  isotopic  studies of the sedimentary record.    
                   In  this  study the principal investigator will  conduct  a  series  of
              laboratory experiments and field comparisons  to  test  the   strength  of  a 
              mathematical  model  for  carbon   isotope  fractionation   resulting  from 
              uptake  by  phytoplankton.    In  collaboration with colleagues at the Alfred
              Wegener  Institut  in  Bremerhaven,  Germany,  and the Monterey  Bay  Aquarium 
              Research  Institute,  he  will  study the effects of several  processes  on 
              carbon  isotope  fractionation  by  phytoplankton  species.    If  successful, 
              this  work could lead to a new predictive  tool  for  understanding  the 
              carbon isotope chemistry of  the  present-day  ocean  and  perhaps  provide a
              key to understanding  paleoclimate  through analysis of marine sediment cores.
