Abstract    :
                      Peterson, Ruth  AST  96-18502    Dr. Peterson will explore the influence
              stellar internal rotation and oxygen abundance have on a   star's properties
              during the core-He burning phase of evolution (the Horizontal Branch phase).   
              Although overall metallicity is a primary factor controlling the location of a
              star on the   Horizontal Branch, it is clear there is a 'second' parameter that
              also influences its position.    Many physical variables have been proposed for
              the second parameter - age, helium, oxygen, and   carbon abundances, rotation,
              and other parameters that control the amount of mass loss - but no   single
              'second' parameter has been clearly identified.  Dr. Peterson proposes to
              continue   investigations into the effects of oxygen abundance and rotation in
              a larger sample of stars and   globular clusters to map the influence of these
              parameters.  New observations and the analysis of   observations in hand will
              delineate trends in stellar rotation and oxygen abundances across a   wide
              range of cluster metallicity, HB morphology and concentration, as well as
              provide more   extensive samples within selected clusters.  ***
