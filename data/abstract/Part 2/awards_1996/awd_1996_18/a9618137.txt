Abstract    :
                Observations with recently developed microstructure instrumentation indicate
              that what had previously been described as small scale biological patchiness
              may not be due to stochastic fluctuations in biological structure, but may be
              undersampled observations of persistent, small scale structure. Persistent, sub
              1-meter structure in the upper ocean poses serious problems for the
              interpretation of data from finescale and mesoscale observational programs. It
              is likely that such sampling programs are underestimating the in situ rate
              processes associated with sub 1-meter structure, as well as the abundance and
              distributional patterns of biological and chemical properties. The common
              occurrence of thin layers and the temporal/spatial coherence of these layers
              compel us to evaluate their role in upper ocean processes. Therefore, the
              overall objectives of this project are to evaluate the contribution of these
              sub-1-meter features to upper ocean trophic dynamics through direct
              measurements of nutrient concentration, particulate matter, autotrophic
              production, and heterotrophic processes, and to undertake a detailed study of
              the occurrence, persistence, and composition of thin biological layers in the
              ocean. In addition, our unique high resolution biological and physical sampling
              system will permit us to investigate the mechanisms of layer formation,
              persistence and erasure.   We will determine the distribution and temporal
              coherence of thin layers of plankton biomass within the euphoric zone over
              extended time periods and characterize the composition of biological thin
              layers using bio optical and bio acoustical sensors as well as via discrete
              sampling of individual thin layers.  We will also assess autotrophic and
              heterotrophic rate processes inside and outside of persistent small scale
              features and map the areal extent of coherent thin layers.  We will also
              quantify the association of thin layers with local physical processes,
              specifically stratification, small scale shear, and turbulent mixing, as well
              as the large scale velocity field and the frequency and amplitude of internal
              waves.  Finally, we will investigate the association of thin layers with local
              surface forcing conditions and evaluate the contribution of biological rates
              occurring within layers to total water column processes.  This data set will
              provide a unique opportunity to evaluate, quantitatively, the role of
              persistent small scale structure in oceanic planktonic food webs. Without a
              clear evaluation of these processes, estimates of biological rates obtained
              with conventional sampling approaches will be biased.    +n ±i ?n ¼f
