Abstract    :
              The Soviet administrative-command economy was the greatest social science
              experiment of this century.  The dismantling of this system will be the
              greatest economic and political challenge of the next quarter century.  It is
              therefore important to understand this  system before it disappears or
              threatens to return.  The purpose of  this research is to study the working
              arrangements of the Soviet administrative-command economy from the 1930s to
              1991 using the newly accessible archives of the Politburo of the Central
              Committee of the Communist Party, the archives of its associated party and
              state organizations, personal archives of Party and state leaders, and more
              than 60 accumulated interviews with Soviet economic administrators conducted by
              the PI at the end of the Soviet period.  This research uses theories of
              information economics, public choice, and theories of bureaucracy to study
              high-level decision making in the Soviet administrative-command economy. It
              addresses the fundamental issue of the viability of the administrative command
              economy raised by Hayek and Mises in the 1920s. It is one of the first in-depth
              studies of working arrangements above the level of the Soviet enterprise. It
              would be the first to use the actual records of the highest echelons of the
              Soviet Party and State to describe how and how well the Soviet
              administrative-command economy worked.  This project seeks to answer a number
              of research questions: How the top Soviet leadership dealt with the greater
              concentration of information at the periphery, how planners' preferences were
              formed, the quality of information upon which high-level decisions were based,
              the size of the party's apparatus, the use of monetary versus physical targets,
              the formation of interest groups, the toleration of criticism and dissent,
              principal/agent problems and identification of the levels at which agents can
              be distinguished from principals, the factors behind the choice of radical
              reform in the 1980s, and risk avoidance behavior.
