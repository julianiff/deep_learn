Abstract    :
              9618315  Kincaid         This work addresses questions related to how on- and
              off-axis  mantle plumes interact (thermally, chemically, and dynamically)  with
              ridges for cases of unsegmented versus segmented spreading  geometries and for
              cases where the ridge migrated relative to the  plume source. The fluid
              dynamics of plume-ridge interaction will be  constrained through a combination
              of laboratory and numerical  modeling techniques. The addition of
              sub-components to the  numerical models that calculate axial patterns in melt
              volume and  chemistry, axial bathymetry and gravity will provide a predictive 
              capability for further constraining mantle processes.
