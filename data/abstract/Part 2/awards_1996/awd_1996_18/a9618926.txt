Abstract    :
              Current   speech   recognition  technology,   while   useful   in  constrained 
              domains with cooperative speakers,  still  leads  to  unacceptably   high  
              error  rates  (30-50%)   on   unconstrained  conversational  or  broadcast
              speech.   An  important  difference  between  these tasks and high accuracy
              conditions is  the  larger  variability  in speaking style, even within data 
              from  a  single  speaker.   Existing  acoustic  models  do  not  account  for 
              the  systematic   factors   behind  this  variability   so   must   be 
              ``broader,'' leading to more confusability among words and  hence  high  error
              rates.  This work proposes to improve acoustic models  by  representing sources
              of variability at three time scales: the  syllable, short regions within an
              utterance, and the speaker.  At  the  syllable  level, automatic clustering
              will capture  syllable  position and phonetic reduction effects.  At the region
              level,  a  slowly  varying  hidden  speaking mode will  indicate  systematic 
              differences in pronunciations associated with reduced vs. clearly  articulated
              speech. At the speaker level, hierarchical models  of  the  correlation among
              speech sounds will improve  adaptation  of  acoustic  models  from small
              amounts of data.   Experiments  will  involve  large  vocabulary recognition of
               conversational  speech  using  a  multi-pass search strategy to handle the 
              cost  of  the  higher-order  models  proposed here. By  representing 
              systematic  variability, the proposed work should significantly advance  both 
              the  target  task of unconstrained speech recognition and  human-  computer
              speech communication more generally.
