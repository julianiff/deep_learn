Abstract    :
                Rational choice models of elections predict that candidates adopt similar,
              centrist platforms in order to win elections.  While this theoretical finding
              is very robust, it has received very little empirtical support.  This is
              particularly true for research on congressional elections.  This project is
              developing a theory to explain candidates' position taking during congressional
              election campaigns.  The theory predicts that candidates will diverge
              significantly on election day due to the polarizing effects of primary
              elections and limits on changes in policy positions -- both of which have been
              ignored by earlier spatial models.  To evaluate this model, candidates'
              locations are operationalized using NOMINATE, a well-known statistical
              procedure based on spatial theory.  This measure is validated with Political
              Action Committee (PAC) contribution data by examining which types of PACs
              donate to candidates.  Both types of data have temporal components that produce
              estimates for candidates over time.  The new measures improve previous ones as
              they can be estimates for both incumbents and challengers.  Finally, these
              measures test predictions derived from the theoretical  model.
