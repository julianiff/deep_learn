Abstract    :
              9618325  Zumberge  This award will support a gravity study of sulphide deposits
              in the  Middle Valley region off the northwest cost of the United States. 
              These deposits occur where hydrothermal circulation systems  discharge at the
              seafloor and provide a unique guide to the  formation of similar deposits that
              are mined on land. Cores of  these deposits have been recovered by the Ocean
              Drilling Program.  The distribution of sulphides in the sediments in these area
              is  reasonably well known at the core locations. The objective of the  present
              project is to use this existing data to verify the  capability of a new towed
              gravimeter system developed by the  principal investigator, and to provide new
              information on the  overall distribution of sulphides in the sediments
              surrounding the  drillholes.  ***
