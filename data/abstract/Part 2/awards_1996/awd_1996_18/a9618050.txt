Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to provide students and designers with improved 
              access to new layered manufacturing processes including MicroElectro Mechanical
               Systems (MEMS) and Shape Deposition Manufacturing (SDM) technologies. 
              Together,  these technologies can facilitate the design of new classes of
              products that  would be difficult, if not impossible, to build with currently
              available  manufacturing techniques.  These processes are capable of generating
              dense,  multi-material parts with complex shapes; the size of device features
              may range  over six orders of magnitude; and the range of materials includes
              metals,  plastics and ceramics.  This spectrum of integrated additive and
              subtractive  fabrication processes will be linked by SDM And MEMS Unified
              Exchange Language  (SAMUEL) service.  The SAMUEL service will provide a common
              interface and rapid  access to two manufacturing processes: SDM and MEMS.   
              Creating the SAMUEL service will demonstrate that designers who are unfamiliar 
              with details of the manufacturing processes can rapidly create physical
              artifacts  and explore new design ideas.  Through a standard interface,
              designers will able  to access the SDM and MEMS manufacturing sites and quickly
              incorporate  manufacturing process constraints into their design system.  The
              manufacturing  constraints can be expressed as rules for invocation at the
              design level.
