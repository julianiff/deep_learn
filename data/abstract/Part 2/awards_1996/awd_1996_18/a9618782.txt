Abstract    :
               9618782 Pachavis  A symposium will be held March 31 - April 4, 1997 on
              Epitaxial Oxide Thin Films covering the understanding and control of epitaxial
              synthesis, processing, and characterization with respect to fundamental issues
              such as microstructural evolution in epitaxy, physical properties of epitaxial
              oxide thin films, and how these issues relate to device applications.. The aim
              of the symposium is to provide a vehicle through which groups of scientists
              working on a set of diverse materials science phenomena can discuss and
              interact on common scientific themes involving similar materials. NSF funds
              will be used to support participation by graduate students and young faculty. 
              There will be an opportunity to assess the field, and to establish ties between
              universities, research institutions, and industry.  It is expected that top
              scientists in the field will attend, and that the symposium will provide an
              effective forum to discuss and delineate critical scientific issues in the
              rapidly developing research areas involving colossal magneto-resistive(CMR)
              materials, especially in epitaxial form, the relationships between CMR and
              defect structure, and  similar relationships in other materials/device areas
              such as ferroelectric memories, nonlinear optical waveguides, microwave
              electronics, and magnetic oxide thin films. %%%  An evaluation of the progress
              and status of Epitaxial Oxide Thin Films and related materials processing and
              characterization issues, especially critical materials and device related
              research areas, and the relationship of materials research to device
              fabrication along with current assessments of the most important developments
              in this field will be of great value to the understanding and enhanced
              utilization of materials in computing, data processing, and communications.
