Abstract    :
              9618101  Kurz    The overall goal of this research is to use the noble gas 
              distribution and isotopic compositions in oceanic volcanic rocks to  constrain
              the long-term degassing behavior of the earth's mantle.   New measurements will
              related helium isotropic variations to the  heavier noble gases (particularly
              Ne, ar, and Xe) as well as other  geochemical tracers such as Sr, Nd, and Pb
              isotopes.  Of particular  interest is a suite of oceanic basalt glasses from
              the super-fast  spreading East Pacific Rise, and the nearby seamounts, which
              are  extremely well documented and are ideal for the noble gas studies.  Laser
              extraction techniques will allow direct examination of the  noble gas
              distribution within individual samples from the mid-ocean  ridges and oceanic
              islands, thus identifying the noble gas  residence sites in mantle derived
              volcanic rocks and constraining  the degree of noble gas compatibility within
              important mantle  mineral phases. The data will also help constrain the dynamic
              of  melting beneath the mid ocean ridges and the mechanisms by which  seamounts
              are formed.1
