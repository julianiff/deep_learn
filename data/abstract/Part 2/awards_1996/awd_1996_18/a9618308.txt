Abstract    :
                  9618308  McGee  the sphere of research includes the development of accurate 
              continuum methods for vibration and stability of prestressed  skewed and
              twisted bodies.  Three areas of structural  mechanics are examined, which
              include: (1) the effect of  corner stress singularities on the vibration and
              buckling of  sectorial and skewed quadrilateral planforms of general  shapes,
              (2)  the vibration and buckling of skewed and  twisted 3-D bodies having mixed
              combinations of clamped and  free edge conditions, and (3) the vibration of
              skewed by  path-dependent centrifugal body forces.
