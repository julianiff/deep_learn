Abstract    :
                  Telesco, Charles  AST  96-18348    Dr. Telesco will carry out an
              observational study into the spatial and spectral properties of the  
              environments of pre-main-sequence, intermediate mass stars.  His study will
              utilize a new   infrared imager/spectrometer (OSCIR), developed by the PI and
              colleagues, to trace in detail the   spatial distributions of dust throughout
              the environments of Herbig Ae/Be stars (those pre-main-  sequence stars with
              masses of 2 to 10 solar masses) to determine how much matter is in the form  
              of circumstellar disks or stellar envelopes.  Spectroscopy of silicate
              particles in the stellar   environments may provide insight into the
              temperature history of the dust particles.  By probing   the environments of
              these intermediate mass stars in the infrared, and characterizing the  
              properties of dust particles and the frequency of occurrence of circumstellar
              disks, Dr. Telesco's   work will provide insight into the earliest stages of
              stellar evolution and, potentially, the   formation of planetary systems.  ***
