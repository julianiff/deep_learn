Abstract    :
               9618656 Cohen  This project addresses dynamical processes of epitaxial growth.
              For GaAs, the evolution of surface morphology, island formation, crossover to
              step flow, and the role of adatoms in growth kinetics and morphology will be
              studied using RHEED and STM.  An important goal is to use the knowledge
              obtained to develop atomic level understanding and control over film growth. 
              Energy-filtered RHEED will be used to improve the comparison with dynamical
              calculations and to eliminate uncertainties in the measurement of diffuse
              intensities.  Step edge scattering factors will be considered in the
              correlation function analysis of diffraction. The project will also study GaN
              growth on bulk GaN platelets(whiskers); this approach is used to remove the
              role of the amorphous buffer layer normally present with GaN growth on
              sapphire. The aim is to obtain definitive data on epitaxial processes having
              direct relationships to microscopic processes of growth. %%% The project
              addresses forefront research issues in a topical area of materials science
              having high technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic
              materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of
              electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuitry.  Additionally, the
              fundamental knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected to
              contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced devices
              and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing
              and producing improved materials, and materials combinations.  An important
              feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the
              training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.
