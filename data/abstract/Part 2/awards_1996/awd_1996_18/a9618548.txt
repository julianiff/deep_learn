Abstract    :
                  Bodenheimer, Peter  AST  96-18548      The discovery of extrasolar planets
              around solar-type stars,  and the observational evidence that  many very young
              stars are surrounded by proto-stellar disks,  indicate that disk and planet 
              formation occur frequently.  The characteristics of  planetary systems and the
              early evolution of  young stellar objects are determined by the formation, 
              evolution, and the dispersal of the disks  that surround forming stars.  Drs.
              Bodenheimer and Lin will  investigate the basic physical  processes that
              determine fundamental aspects of disk  evolution : 1) the formation of
              protostellar  disks, 2) the disk evolution which sets the stage for 
              protoplanetary formation, and 3) the  depletion of the residual disks. Their
              calculations will  help in identifying the disk evolutionary  timescales and
              the likely outcome of protoplanet formation.
