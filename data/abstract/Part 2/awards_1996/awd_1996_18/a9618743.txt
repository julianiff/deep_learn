Abstract    :
              9618743  Goad  This award to University of Michigan will provide new computers
              and water sampling bottles for use on the R/V Laurentian, an 80-foot research
              vessel operated as part of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory
              System (UNOLS).  The shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist
              researchers to conduct studies of the Great Lakes in 1997 and in future years.
