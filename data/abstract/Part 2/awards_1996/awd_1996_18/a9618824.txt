Abstract    :
              Professor Mark Ediger of the Department of Chemistry of the University of  
              Wisconsin-Madison is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and  
              Computational Chemistry Program to perform experimental characterizations   of
              the glass transition in supercooled organic liquids which include a   number of
               polyaromatic compounds such as anthracene, tetracene4, rubrene   and
              derivatives. Experiments are proposed to investigate the nature of   molecular
              motion in deeply supercooled organic liquids to probe the   nature of the
              liquid/glass transition. The questions that this research   will address are:
              (1) What types of molecular motions occur in deeply   supercooled liquids; (2)
              Is the supercooled liquid spatially   heterogeneous; and (3) how is this
              connected to the non-exponential   relaxation that is often observed. Optical,
              dielectric and NMR   spectroscopies will be used to answer these questions, and
              in particular,   how long-lived are the regions of different temperature, what
              is  the   connection between non-exponential dynamics and  heterogeneity, what
              is   the connection between heterogeneous dynamics and  the observed  
              enhancement of translation and  if  the anisotropic motion is the   responsible
              for enhanced translation.   In spite of the significant progress in the
              molecular interpretation of   the static and dynamic properties of the liquid
              state,  the properties of    liquids and the molecular motions which occur near
              the glass transition   temperature, are still not well understood.  The
              experiments being   conducted by Edgar are designed to shed light these
              problems, on the   anomalous rotational and transactional  relaxation, and the
              role of   spatially inhomogeneous dynamics in the glass transition.
