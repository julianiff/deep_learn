                                        Abstract                                  SOIFER, B.
              T.  AST-9618686      Funds will be used to construct a near-infrared integral 
              field spectrograph to be used on the 200-inch telescope of  the Palomar
              Observatory.  The instrument will permit unique  and detailed studies of a wide
              variety of astrophysical  environments such as star forming regions, the
              Galactic  center, starburst galaxies, Seyfert galaxies, ultraluminous  infrared
              galaxies, and high redshift radio galaxies.  The  imaging spectrograph will
              provide simultaneous two-  dimensional spatial information and spectral
              information  over a field of view of 5" x 10".  Slit widths will be ~  0.7",
              delivering a resolution, R = 1500, corresponding to a  velocity full width at
              half maximum of unresolved spectral  lines measuring ~ 200 km/sec.  Velocity
              centroids of high  signal-to-noise spectral features will be measurable to < 20
               km/sec.  An innovative component of the instrument is a  simple design for the
              construction of the image-slicing  front end and the use of two slits to double
              the field of  view above that of a spectrograph with a single slit.  The 
              instrument will be patterned closely after a recently  constructed longslit
              near-infrared spectrograph.  An  existing infrared camera will be used as the
              detector for  the instrument.
