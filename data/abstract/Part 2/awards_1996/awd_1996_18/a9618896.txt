Abstract    :
              9618896  Van Zoest    Renewing Mathematics Teaching through Curriculum (RMTC) is
              a collaborative of fifteen high schools in southwestern Michigan that have
              recently adopted the Core-Plus Mathematics Project (CPMP) instructional
              materials in their quest to improve mathematics teaching so that all students
              can develop mathematical power.   In this four-year professional development
              and curricular implementation project, all 154 mathematics teachers in the
              targeted schools participate in an integrated, reflective cycle of teacher
              enhancement activities comprised of eight-day summer sessions, biannual
              meetings of all participants, and regular and frequent contact among teachers
              in school buildings that includes peer mentoring, class observations, common
              planning periods, and small-group meetings.  Each teacher participates in an
              average of 382 hours of professional development over a three-year period.   
              As a Local Systemic Change through Teacher Enhancement in Mathematics, Grades
              7-12, project, RMTC has five key elements:  (1)  RMTC is integrally connected
              with the exemplary curriculum that the collaborative teachers use in their
              classrooms; (2) the approach that RMTC takes to professional development is
              consistent with the approach the exemplary curricula take to student learning;
              (3) RMTC acknowledges that systemic change in mathematics education requires
              the commitment and understanding of the communities beyond the mathematics
              department and school; (4) RMTC takes advantage of the unique strengths the
              individual schools bring to the collaborative to help in overcoming each
              other's weaknesses; and (5) the formation of RMTC was initiated by teachers and
              continues to be guided by both teachers and administrators in the collaborative
              schools.         The project will also produce products to share the ideas
              generated by RMTC with other districts that are facing the challenge of
              implementing an innovative mathematics curriculum.  A WWW site will permit
              immediate dissemination of information and, by  the conclusion of the project,
              summary products will be produced in multimedia format (CD-ROM), as well as
              paper copy.      Non-federal cost-sharing in the project is over $ 750,000, of
              which more than $ 150,000 is derived from Western Michigan University and
              approximately $ 600,000 from the participating school districts.
