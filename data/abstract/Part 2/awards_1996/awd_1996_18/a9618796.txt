Abstract    :
              This research addresses theoretical and computational aspects  of structured
              optimization: polynomial-time algorithms, fully  polynomial-time approximation
              schemes, complexity issues  related to semidefinite programming, and numerical 
              experimentation. The goals are: (1) to study the efficiency of  widely-used
              Lagrangian decomposition techniques with emphasis  on the development of
              nearly-optimal potential-reduction  methods; (2) to study general block-angular
              and linear bordered  block-diagonal problems, and, time permitting, their 
              specialized applications in combinatorics, operations research, 
              communications, engineering and finance; (3) to explore the  complexity of
              semidefinite programming with real and integer  variables; and (4) to conduct
              computational experiments which  will examine the numerical behavior and
              practical performance  of the developed algorithms.
