Abstract    :
                Bieging,  John  AST 96-18523      Dr. Bieging will study the process of mass
              loss in evolved stars of intermediate mass, both red   giant stars and stars
              evolving beyond to become planetary nebulae.  His observational program   takes
              advantage of a variety of techniques and instrumentation to obtain a full
              picture of the gas   and dust in the circumstellar envelopes of these stars,
              with a particular focus on the source   IRC+10216.  The analysis of molecular
              spectroscopy in the mm-wavelengths will reveal details   about the chemical and
              physical structure of the circumstellar envelope and the process of mass  
              loss.  Observations in the mid-IR for a sample of stars evolving from the red
              giant to the   planetary nebulae stage will also allow the determination of the
              dust distribution, density, and   temperature in the stellar envelopes.    ***
