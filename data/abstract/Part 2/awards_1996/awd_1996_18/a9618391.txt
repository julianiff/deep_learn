Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    SBR-9618391  Reynolds    This project will provide funds for twelve
              U. S. scholars to  partially defray their airfare costs incurred as part of 
              participating in the XVI International Congress of Linguistics  (20-25 July
              1997) in Paris, France. The twelve will receive the  funds after they have
              returned from the Congress and have  submitted a report of the meeting's
              relevance to them and proof  of travel by a U.S. air carrier.
