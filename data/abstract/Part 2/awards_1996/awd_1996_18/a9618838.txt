Abstract    :
              Tools  for  Lexicon  Building" project  is  preparing  a  lexical  database  for
              English called "Framenet" built on abundant  corpus  evidence and formulated on
              the principles of frame semantics.  It  will  be  freely  available to
              researchers  in  several  formats,  including  one  that can serve as an
              accessory to  WordNet.   The  primary  deliverable  is  a highly relational 
              "starter"  lexicon  containing  5,000 entries covering major semantic domains. 
               Each  database entry is associated with the semantic frame in which  it 
              participates,  and annotated with respect to how it  constellates  with  the 
              elements  of that frame, both morphosyntactically  and  semantically.   Entries
              will also list examples  taken  from  the  corpus  showing  the range of the
              word's use, including  relative  frequency  data.  Another significant
              development of the  project  is  a  set  of  high-performance computational
              tools  for  corpus  research,  annotation,  and analysis (some  of  which  are 
              being  developed in collaboration with colleagues in Europe) which  will  be 
              made  available  to  the research community.   The  resulting  facility,  
              which   incorporates  both  linguistic-semantic   and  lexicographic
              techniques, will be valuable to human users of both  printed  and  online 
              works  and also  to  researchers  exploring  natural  language processing,
              speech recognition, and the complex  problems of language understanding.
