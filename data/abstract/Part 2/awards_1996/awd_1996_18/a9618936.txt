Abstract    :
              9618936  Molloy    This  36 month project will provide pedagogical and content
              enhancement for 240 different secondary teachers in a three county area of New
              York,Dutchess, Orange and Ulster counties.  There are a total of 53 secondary
              schools in these three districts.  The teachers will be teachers of chemistry,
              biology, physics, environmental science and computer science.    An average of
              slightly more than four teachers per school will be involved in the project
              over the three year period.  Each of the teachers will participate in two-two
              week workshops on the Marist College campus which will be content enrichment
              and pedagogical transformation.  They will work with the actual materials and
              instruments which will be delivered to their classrooms as well as  the 'van'
              drivers who will service their school.  A total of three vans will be operating
              from year two on with equipment to provide laboratories in chemistry, biology,
              physics, environmental science, and computer science.   The Boards of
              Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) have committed to providing increasing
              support in years two and three of the project and assuming full support in
              subsequent years.  Significant monetary and gifts in kind have been received
              and are promised which will make the cost share approximately 87% of the total
              reqested from the Foundation.  The project has an actual cost to the Foundation
              of less than $5,000 per teacher.
