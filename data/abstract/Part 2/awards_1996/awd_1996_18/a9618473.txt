Abstract    :
              The principal investigators have been developing tilt meters  for long-term
              monitoring of mid-ocean ridge deformation.  This proposal is to construct
              additional instruments and  deploy them on the South Cleft segment of the Juan
              de Fuca  ridge in a pilot experiment to ascertain that the  instruments will
              collect usable data.
