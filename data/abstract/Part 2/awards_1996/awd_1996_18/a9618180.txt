Abstract    :
               This is a study of small business success.  The small business arena, a growing
              sector of the economy which women have been entering in record numbers,
              provides an important context in which to examine fundamental theoretical
              issues of gender, work and family. This project combines a survey and intensive
              interviews with small business owners in upstate New York. The study is
              organized around two interrelated questions: 1) Through what mechanisms do
              structural and individual variables contribute to inequality between men and
              women owners? 2) How does family intersect with work to shape the economic and
              personal lives of these women and men?   %%%   This project charts new
              territory in four major ways. First, it traces the specific ways in which a
              broad range of structural and individual variables combine to affect both
              economic and personal outcomes such as emotional well-being. Particular
              attention is paid to the direct and indirect paths through which personal and
              family characteristics affect both economic and personal success. Second, this
              study brings together such seemingly disparate areas of inquiry as the
              economics of small business, work-family linkages, gender and reasoning, and
              emotional well-being. Such integration should enhance understanding not only of
              gender and small business ownership, but of the dynamics of gender, work and
              family more generally. Third, key work and family issues are examined from the
              perspective of women and men who have more control than most over all aspects
              of their work, including the boundaries between work and family. Finally, the
              use of both quantitative and qualitative research techniques will enhance the
              quality of the data and the strength of the conclusions.
