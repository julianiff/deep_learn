Abstract    :
              9618935  Bronzino  This research is designed to test the hypothesis that there
              are  significant changes, during early postnatal development, in  synaptic
              plasticity in a specific neuronal circuit, the perforant  path/dentate granule
              synapse, in the hippocampal formation, a  structure intimately involved in
              learning and memory.  Recently,  it has been shown that hippocampal circuit
              responses to afferent  input vary depending upon the frequency and pattern of
              the input.  Specifically, the response to certain patterns of hippocampal 
              afferent inputs may result in either enhancement (long-term  potentiation), or
              a diminishment (long-term depression) of the  hippocampal synaptic response. 
              The major goal of this research  is to apply recently developed surgical and
              recording techniques  to quantify the development of frequency-dependent
              responses of  the perforant path/dentate granule cell synapse in preweaning, 
              freely moving male and female rats.  In this research, evoked  field potential
              analyses will be used to evaluate changes in both  synaptic activation and
              cellular discharge.  This work will  attempt to quantify changes in
              frequency-dependent synaptic  function during an early period of development. 
              This research  could provide information on the functional development of a 
              neural network known to be involved in cognitive processes  including spatial
              learning, memory and mapping.  ***
