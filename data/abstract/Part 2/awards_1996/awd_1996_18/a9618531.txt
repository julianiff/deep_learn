Abstract    :
              9618531  Bright    The Conference on Classroom Assessment in Mathematics project
              addresses this area of K-12 mathematics through two conferences, in sequence: 
              (1) the first is a small, working conference for 32 core, invited participants,
              to be held in late spring 1997 in Raleigh/Durham, N.C; and (2) the second is a
              large, dissemination conference for approximately 250 teachers and leaders of
              K-12 mathematics, to be held in Washington, D. C., in April 1998 during the
              week of the national NCTM meeting.   Those participating in the working
              conference include researchers, acknowledged experts in the field of
              assessment, and practitioners, who are to address the issues surrounding
              quality classroom assessment in mathematics through position and working papers
              prepared in advance of the conference.  Conference proceedings are to be edited
              following the working conference and widely disseminated during NCTM Week. 
              Collectively, the conferences and proceedings identify research issues and
              implementation strategies that support quality classroom assessment as a tool
              for greater student achievement in mathematics, and produce recommendations to
              begin addressing the issues.
