              AST-9618811      The goals of this project are (1) to make possible new 
              ground-based, diffraction-limited imaging spectroscopic  observations of major
              astronomical significance, including  imaging spectroscopy of protoplanetary
              disks and active  galactic nuclei, and astrometric imaging of globular cluster 
              cores; (2) to develop a new multi-aperture, wide-field  interferometer that
              will record the field-angle and  subaperture-dependent phase information
              required for  diffraction-limited post-processed imaging spectroscopy; (3) 
              achieving a deeper level of understanding of atmospheric  turbulence, its
              optical consequences and correction; and (4)  to develop an alternative
              approach to active correction  (Adaptive Optics) that utilizes full
              post-processing.
