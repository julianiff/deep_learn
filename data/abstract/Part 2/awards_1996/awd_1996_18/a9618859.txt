Abstract    :
              9618859  Freitag  This award to University of Rhode Island will provide new
              sensors and sampling equipment for seawater studies, new shipboard computers
              and new slip rings for use with fiber optic instrumentation on the research
              vessel Endeavor, operated as part of the University National Oceanographic
              Laboratory System research fleet. The shared-use instrumentation supported here
              will assist ocean researchers conduct studies in the North Atlantic Ocean in
