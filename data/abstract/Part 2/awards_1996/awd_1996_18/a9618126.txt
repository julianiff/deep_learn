Abstract    :
              Cessi  9618126  A hierarchy of quasi-geostrophic (QG) models (barotropic, 
              two-layer baroclinic,  baroclinic with feedback between sea surface temperature
              and  wind stress) will  be used to examine the time-dependence and stability of
              a  non-linear system  forced by steady winds. Of particular interest is the
              degree  of intrinsic long-term  variability as a function of forcing to
              dissipation ratio  and in understanding how  sea surface temperature/wind
              stress feedbacks produce new  modes of low-  frequency variability.
