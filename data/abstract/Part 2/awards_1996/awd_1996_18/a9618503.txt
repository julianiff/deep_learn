Abstract    :
              Knapp, Gillian  AST 96-18503    Dr. Knapp will investigate the phenomenon of
              mass loss in the late stages of stellar evolution.    Her observational program
              will allow the determination of the size, shape and velocity structure   of the
              dusty molecular circumstellar envelope of stars with the goal of  providing
              insight into the   asymmetries of mass loss and the evolution of mass loss
              rates over time.  Two specific projects   will be carried out : 1) mapping the
              radio photospheres of stars with the VLA for comparison   with structure
              observed in the circumstellar envelope, and 2) investigating multiple winds in
              late   AGB stars using a large survey of molecular emission line profiles from
              circumstellar envelopes.    ***
