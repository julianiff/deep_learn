              Fan, C. Cindy       Chan, Kam Wing  University of California, Los Angeles  
              University of Washington   The central objectives of this research project are
              to examine the processes and outcomes of internal migration in the transitional
              Chinese economy.  Specifically the work focuses upon the role of socio-economic
              segmentation resulting from the socio-political control mechanisms employed by
              the state-notably the household registration (hukou) system.  A comparison of
              hukou and non-hukou migrations and migrants' socio-economic characteristics is
              undertaken based on a large data sample drawn from the 1990 Census and 1995
              Population Survey, as well as, small scale in-depth field interviews to be
              conducted in Guangdong and Hubei provinces.  Statistical and quantitative
              analyses will be utilized to draw out relationships and findings.  The research
              promises to break new ground by exploring the dynamic interaction between state
              institutions and the structural transformation of the economy.  The problem
              will also be evaluated in terms of existing historical-cultural, neo-classical,
              and segmented labor market theories.  The project will theorize the
              relationship between the state, industrialization and internal migration in
              contemporary China.  The research will be carried out by two U.S. scientists as
              well as two Chinese researchers.  The research has important theoretical and
              policy implications in regards to the processes defining migration in currently
              common situations of structural adjustment
