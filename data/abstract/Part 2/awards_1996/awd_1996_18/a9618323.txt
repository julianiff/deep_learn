Abstract    :
               The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program is supporting   professor
              Scuseria at Rice University.  During the next three years he   will continue
              his work on Linear scaling in Electronic structure methods.    The research
              contains both computational development, as well as   applications.  The
              computational work is focused in at five distinct   areas.  These include (1)
              Improvements to the Fast Multipole method, (2)   Improvements to the
              exchange-correlation quadratures, (3) diagonalization   bottlenecks (4) O(N)
              Hartree-Fock algorithms, and finally (5) improving   DFT capabilities. 
              Specific chemical problems to be addressed in the next   funding period will
              emphasize Fullerene growth, graphite sheets and   carbon nanotubes.    First
              principles electronic structure calculations of molecules remain   limited to
              systems of modest size because of the steep computational   cost.  The
              objective of this research is to develop fast, high accuracy   methods for the
              prediction of properties of large systems such as   biomolecules and
              nonostructures.   The quest here is to develop full   linear scaling methods.  
              Work will continue in this area with specific   emphasis on removing the
              existing computational bottlenecks.
