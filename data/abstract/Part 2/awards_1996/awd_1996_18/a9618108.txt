Abstract    :
                This project examines altruistic, charitable and cooperative behavior using
              theoretical, experimental and standard econometric analyses. The project has
              three parts.  Part I studies the nature of altruism. The objective of this
              component is to further our basic thinking about how economists should approach
              issues of altruism and cooperative behavior.  This part contains both
              theoretical and experimental research.  The theory incorporates the notion of
              an `empathic altruist` - someone who judges the generosity of another based on
              what he himself would have done.  The experiments are variations on simple
              bargaining games designed to sharpen our understanding of why subjects engage
              in apparently altruistic behavior.    Part II focuses on a particular aspect of
              this issue: charitable giving. The unifying theme of this part is the design of
              institutions to provide public goods. The part starts with a theoretical
              investigation of the endogenous formation of charitable organizations and the
              role of fundraising. This is followed with several experimental studies that
              should `reveal a preference` for the particular institutional forms of
              charities.    Part III of the project is a standard public finance study of the
              determinants of volunteerism. A significant fraction of households volunteer,
              and the average volunteer gives hundreds of hours per year, yet we know very
              little about voluntary labor supply. This component includes two empirical
              projects designed to investigate the determinants of voluntary labor supply in
              the household using data from the Current Population Survey.
