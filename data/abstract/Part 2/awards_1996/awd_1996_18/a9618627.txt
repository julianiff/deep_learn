Abstract    :
                      ABSTRACT        Proposal Number: CTS-9618627  Principal Investigator:
              Wallace      This is an experimental and numerical study of the turbulent
              mixing layer, focusing on the properties of the vorticity and passive scalar
              fields.  The structure and dynamics of the vorticity  field will be studied by
              statistical means through an examination of  the moments and spectra, as well
              as by the joint-probability-density analysis of the vorticity  field. 
              Three-dimensional visualizations of the flow will be obtained from the
              accompanying large-eddy simulation to yield a complete picture of the
              properties of the vorticity field.  Both experiments and numerical calculations
              will be extended to investigate in detail the fluxes of a passive scalar, with
              the purpose of highlighting the physical phenomena that govern scalar
              transport.  Statistical data and instantaneous fields will be studied, and the
              performance of scalar transport models for the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
              equations will be evaluated.
