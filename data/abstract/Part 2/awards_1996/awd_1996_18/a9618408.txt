Abstract    :
                Hankins, Timothy  AST  96-18408    Drs. Hankins, Eilek, and Weatherall will
              carry out an observational and theoretical program of study into the mechanisms
              for radio emission from pulsars. The investigators combine an observational
              program which includes ultra-high time resolution pulsar observations with
              theoretical and numerical analysis and simulations that is driven by specific
              tests with observations.  Ultra-high time resolution sampling of several bright
              pulsars allows them to discriminate between specific models for radio emission.
               They will also determine the physical conditions in the radio-loud region,
              through analysis of the plasma dynamics of the polar cap.    ***
