Abstract    :
                The flux of pore water DOC to overlying waters and the cycling of DOC within
              sediments are important but poorly constrained components of the oceanic carbon
              cycle.  Preliminary pore water work and in situ benthic tripod flux estimates
              suggest three hypotheses:  1) marine sediments are an important source of water
              column DOC, 2) a component of the flux contributes to the refractory water
              column DOC pool, and 3) A component of the flux may be oxidized near the
              sediment water interface.  The first hypothesis will be tested by using a
              benthic tripod to accurately measure this flux along a depth gradient reaching
              across the shelf to upper slope.  The second hypothesis will be tested by
              pooling the overlying water in the flux tripod at the end of several
              deployments to form an ultrafiltered large volume sample that we will
              characterize at the molecular level and compare to similarly characterized
              water column DOC.  An in situ dialysis sampler to sample for pore water DOC
              concentration and in situ oxygen concentration manipulation experiments will
              test the third and all will take place along the Pacific Northwest cost, off
              the northwest coast of Mexico and in the Puget Sound.
