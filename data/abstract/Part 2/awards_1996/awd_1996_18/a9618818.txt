Abstract    :
              9618818  Apodaca    The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Program proposes a
              five year  Environmental Leadership Project designed to promote the 
              acquisition of knowledge, tools and habits of mind that enable  teachers of
              middle and high school students to implement quality  environmental science
              education.  Two objectives are to enhance the  quality of existing
              environmental education courses and to infuse  concepts developed through the
              study of environmental science in  key areas of the existing science
              curriculum.  The project includes  a four-year series of summer residential
              Core Institutes, four for  high school and four for middle school science
              teachers.  Follow-up  and networking activities continues for the life of the
              project and  beyond.  A total of 400 science-teacher leaders are to be involved
               in the summer Core Institutes.  A second tier of development is in  the format
              of 48 two-week Outreach TORCH Institutes, led by teams  of Core Institute
              teachers, working in collaboration with  colleagues from higher education at
              college and university sites.   These institutes are to engage an additional
              1,440 classroom  teachers in summer programs and academic year assignments
              involving  a minimum of 100 contact hours of supervised work.  All activities 
              involve laboratory and field work, a range of student learning and  assessment
              techniques and emphasis on the use of computers and  technology for
              professional use, classroom use, and instructional  purposes.
