Abstract    :
                    Lambert, David  AST  96-18414    Dr. Lambert and collaborators will carry
              out a diverse array of investigations into the chemical   abundances of stars
              that will provide insieht into the processes of stellar nucleosynthesis and  
              galactic chemical evolution.  The wide variety of projects includes
              investigations of nearby F and   G dwarfs to define the age and spatial
              dependence of chemical compositions at intermediate   metallicities where sharp
              transitions in abundance patterns are seen, determination of Mg   isotopic
              abundances that have the potential to constrain models of supernovae,
              observations   directed at illuminating the nature of the s-process operating
              in late-type AGB stars, and the   exploration of several groups of stars that
              present chemical 'puzzles.'  Many of the projects build   on previous results
              of the PI and collaborators, and a number of observations intend to make use  
              of the new IR spectroscopic instrumentation available at national facilities
              and new   instrumentation at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope.    ***
