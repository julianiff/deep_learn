Abstract    :
              The Federal Statistical System consists of 14 principal statistical agencies and
              over 60 others spending large amounts of money collecting basic social and
              economic data on the United States.  It is the foundation of vast data
              resources for the social sciences used broadly across the disciplines.  The
              knowledge required to design complex sample surveys, which are the basis of
              much Federal government statistical series, is a blend of statistics,
              sociology, psychology, economics, and computer science.  The purpose of this
              grant is to provide core support for the Joint Program in Survey Methodology
              (JPSM), offering graduate degree programs in survey methodology.  The JPSM is a
              consortium of the University of Maryland, the University of Michigan, and
              Westat, Inc.  The grant provides for faculty and staff support permitting the
              admission of new Masters' cohorts of students, the development of formal
              courses in economic statistics, and the creation of a certificate program in
              sampling statistics.
