Abstract    :
                Basri, Gibor  AST  96-18439    Dr. Basri will carry out an observational study
              of the properties  of brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars.  His study is
              timely and  important in light of the recent discoveries of very low mass 
              companions to other stars.  His research plan has 3 primary  objectives : 1) to
              search for brown dwarfs in the Pleiades star  cluster and to use them to
              estimate the brown dwarf mass fraction  and to establish the "lithium age" of
              the cluster in conjunction  with stellar models, 2) to explore the relation
              between  rotational velocity and activity in late M stars, and 3) to  improve
              model atmospheres for very cool main-sequence stars  through the use of
              atmospheric diagnostics provided by high-  resolution spectroscopy.   The
              proposed array of topics take  advantage of the observational facilities at
              Keck and at Lick, to  which the PI has access.  ***
