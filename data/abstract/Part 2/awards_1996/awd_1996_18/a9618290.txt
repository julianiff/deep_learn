Abstract    :
              9618290  Hildebrand         This project will complete the analysis and
              reporting of an  application of seafloor geodesy to the problem of describing
              the  pattern of horizontal deformation that occurs in the vicinity of a 
              mid-ocean ridge crest. The first multikilometer-scale system to  measure the
              pattern of strain accumulation in the vicinity of a  ridge crest on nested
              scales from 1 to 8 km was installed on the  Cleft segment of the Juan de Fuca
              Ridge in 1994. Resurveys were  done in 1995 and 1996.
