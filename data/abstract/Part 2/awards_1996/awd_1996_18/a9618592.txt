Abstract    :
              This project will conduct deep-dwelling sclerosponges from a range  of depths
              and sites in the western Pacific Ocean and examine the  changes in skeletal
              chemistry over the last hundred years or more,  with at least biannual
              resolution.  Oxygen isotopes can serve as  tracers for changes in ocean
              temperature and therefore help to  determine the pattern of long-term variation
              (decadal to  centennial).  Thermistors will be deployed at each site, and 
              monthly water samples will be collected to ground-truth analyses.   Age control
              will be accomplished through U/Th dating and trends of  anthropogenic carbon
              isotopes.
