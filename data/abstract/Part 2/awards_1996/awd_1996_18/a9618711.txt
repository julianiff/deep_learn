Abstract    :
              9618711  Tomanek    The North Dakota Science Teacher Enhancement Program
              (ND-STEP)  involves 20 teachers per year in a 14-month program of research and 
              inservice activities, at one of North Dakota's research  universities.  During
              each of 4-years 10-pairs of middle and high-  school science teachers from
              North Dakota and Minnesota will  participate in ND-STEP.  Each pair will work
              with one scientist.   The 6-week summer research experience is complemented by
              completion  of a graduate course on inquiry teaching and attendance at four 
              full-day sessions during the academic year where the focus is on 
              implementation of action plans and teaching by inquiry.  Teachers  may earn
              seven graduate credit hours for the summer activities and  2-Continuing
              Education credits for the academic year sessions. In  years 2-4 a small group
              of "master" teachers will be selected as  ND-STEP Adjunct Faculty.  Their
              preparation includes working with  NSF supported curriculum materials such as
              SEPUP, ChemCom, A  Private Universe, etc.  They will conduct science seminars
              for  their peers about the research they've done and lead inservice  sessions
              on the NRC Science Standards and inquiry teaching.  An ND-  STEP Steering
              Committee will meet twice a year to guide the  project.
