Abstract    :
              Peters    9618287    The data analysis of three microstructure experiments in
              the  Hudson Estuary will  be focused on three major topics: (1) the variability
              of  turbulent mixing under  different flow conditions and external forcing; (2)
              the  relations between mixing  and flow properties such as shear,
              stratification  and  internal wave trains; and  (3) a test of turbulent
              parameterizations used in numerical  models.
