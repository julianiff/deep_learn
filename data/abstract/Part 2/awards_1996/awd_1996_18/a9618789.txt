Abstract    :
              9618789  Drabold    This grant is to support research on the electronic 
              properties of amorphous silicon and related materials.  Using well proven
              electronic structure techniques,  supplemented by the thermal molecular
              dynamics simulations,  the plans are to study: (1) the microscopic structure of
               midgap as well as band-tail states and the effect of  phonons, (2) the nature
              of electron localization in a three  dimension model containing several
              thousand atoms, (3) the  effects of doping of Boron and Phosphorus in
              hydrogenated  amorphous silicon, using density functional molecular  dynamics
              on large cells (4) the AC and also estimates of DC  conductivity for intrinsic
              and doped systems, using Kubo  formula, followed by comparisons to experiments.
               These  calculations are also expected to lead to advancements in 
              computational algorithms using local basis approaches, i.e.  those designed
              specifically for semiconductors and  insulators.  %%%  This grant, to a young
              PI,  is to support research on the  electronic properties of amorphous silicon
              and related  materials.  The research uses state of the art techniques to 
              conduct complex, microscopic calculations for the energies  of electrons and
              also the resistance.  The latter can be  calculated for both an applied DC
              field and an applied AC  field.  The project also includes temperature effects.
               The  benefits of this project are to a detailed understanding of  the
              microscopic properties of doped and disordered  semiconductors, used in a
              multitude of devices, as well as  to some insight in to possible ways to
              improve the  algorithms for these calculations.  ***
