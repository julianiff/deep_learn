              Abstract  ATM-9618025  Najjar, Raymond G.  Pennsylvania State University  Title:
              Assessment of the Response of the Ocean-Atmosphere System to  the Evolution of
              the Southern Ocean During the Cenozoic    This award supports a study of the
              role of southern hemisphere  ocean bathymetry and continental configuration in
              the evolution of  global ocean circulation, climate and the cryosphere during
              much of  the Cenozoic (14 to 55 million years ago) using general circulation 
              models of the ocean and atmosphere.  In particular, by conducting  a series of
              numerical experiments of varying complexity (with  idealized and realistic
              ocean bathymetry and with uncoupled models)  this work will evaluate the
              effects on ocean circulation and  climate of (1) the separation of Australia
              from Antarctica, (2) the  opening of Drake Passage, (3) the progressive
              increase in the  surface area of the ocean in the southern hemisphere, and (4)
              the  Antarctica ice cap.  An important component of this study will be  the
              evolution of the models using paleoceanographic data on ocean  circulation and
              thermal structure for the Cenozoic.  This model-  data comparison will also
              provide a framework for the  interpretation of paleoceanographic data and
              model-data comparison  will help to constrain the possible causes of the
              dramatic changes  in the earth system that occurred during this time period. 
              The  proposed simulations will also allow the evaluation of previously 
              proposed hypotheses regarding the development of an extensive  Antarctic
              ice-sheet.
