Abstract    :
              9618641  Bond         This project will test preliminary findings of  millennial
              (1500-year) cycles in North Atlantic surface  circulation during the Holocene. 
              The PIs will analyze  existing sediment cores and collect new ones from a wide 
              area of the North Atlantic, focusing  on sites with very  high sedimentation
              rate.  Analyses will include  concentrations of planktic foraminifera as well
              as alkenone  analyses on bulk sediment.  If preliminary findings are 
              confirmed, it may be possible to predict future natural  climate variability,
              at least on millennial timescales, in  the region.
