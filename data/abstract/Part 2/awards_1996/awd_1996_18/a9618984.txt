Abstract    :
              9618984  Wood    This Local Systemic Change project is submitted by a Coalition
              of  nine Delaware School Districts, the State Department of Public  Instruction
              and the Delaware Science, Math and Technology Education  Foundation.  Support
              and expertise is drawn from the State  Legislature, the school districts,
              business, industry, and  academia.    The project will initiate a hands-on
              science program in all 58  elementary schools in the 9 school districts. 
              Approximately 1800  elementary teachers in the program will receive
              professional  development in order to help them fully implement exemplary 
              curricula; FOSS, Insights and Science and Technology for Children.    This
              program will:    *    Provide every elementary teacher with 150 hours of      
              professional development linked to exemplary curricula in       order to deepen
              their understanding of science content,       strengthen their capacity to
              teach science and embed science       as a central element in the K-6
              curriculum.    *    Build the capacity to sustain science education in every   
                 district by developing a network of teacher leaders in every       school in
              the Coalition and creating a core of district       Science Specialists
              throughout the state to support the Lead       Teachers.    *    Foster
              partnerships with higher education to align pre-service       and in-service
              teacher education.    The request is for $5,402,013 for 5 years with cost
              sharing  estimated as $6,700,000.
