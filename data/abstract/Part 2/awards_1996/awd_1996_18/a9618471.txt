              exchange of  the latest knowledge about high speed photography and photonics.  
              NSF, due to its involvement in both education and in fundamental  research in
              photonics and imaging, supports this grant to enable  graduate students and
              post-doctoral fellows to attend the 22nd  International Congress on High Speed
              Photography and Photonics.  ***
