              AST-9618723    Funds are to be used to complete a mid-infrared (5 mm to 25  mm
              spectral regime) high resolution (R ~ 150,000) cross-  dispersed echelon
              spectrograph and to demonstrate its  capabilities on a telescope.  Initially
              the spectrograph is  to be equipped with a 20 x 64 element Si:As focal plane 
              array.
