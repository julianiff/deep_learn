Abstract    :
                    96-18459  Smith, Verne    Dr. Smith plans a program of research which will
              increase  understanding of stellar nucleosynthesis and the early  chemical
              evolution of our Galaxy.  His observational program  will investigate stellar
              abundances in globular clusters and  the halo field of our Milky Way Galaxy, as
              well as in field  stars in the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud.  A  comparison of
              the detailed abundance profiles among these  populations will shed light on the
              formation and relative  star formation histories, and the resultant
              nucleosynthesis  in these stellar systems.  Dr. Smith intends to increase 
              sample sizes and quality to address several particularly  intriguing recent
              results:  a) the observed difference in r-  process elemental abundance
              patterns between field halo and  globular cluster stars and b) the extent and
              nature o the  variations in light element abundances (e.g. C, N, O,  Na)  seen
              among samples in individual globular clusters.  The  first result may suggest
              that there has been a segregation  in nucleosynthetic sites of the
              alpha-process versus the r-  process elements in the early galaxy.  The second
              area of  research is aimed at better understanding the relative  importance and
              cause of abundance variations due to internal  stellar mixing and/or primordial
              abundance effects.  ***
