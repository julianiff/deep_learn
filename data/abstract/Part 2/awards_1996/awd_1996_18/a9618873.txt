Abstract    :
              The Brookings Panel on Economic Activity aims to focus macroeconomic research on
              problems confronting the U.S. and world economy and on the economic
              relationships that are crucial to addressing such problems.  The Panel strives
              to fulfill this purpose by generating, discussing, and publishing high quality,
              relevant, and timely research on a broad range of applied macroeconomic topics.
               The Panel's first commitment is to product quality research, and its method of
              operation is designed with that goal foremost in mind. Its research, published
              in the Brookings Panel on Economic Activitv, undergoes a much more intensive
              process of review, criticism, discussion and editing than conventional journals
              can provide.  In this process, and in the selection of topics and authors, the
              directors of the Panel  are aided by the Panel Advisers - a group of experts
              spanning a broad range of philosophical views and methodological preferences.  
              The Panel does not pursue highly abstract and purely theoretical modeling of
              economic relationships which cannot be tested against data and actual
              experience.  But subject to that constraint, its notion of relevance is broad. 
              It includes research to explore fundamental characteristics of the economy and
              how it responds to policy, as well as more applied research aimed at clarifying
              and quantifying economic relations.  It is concerned with issues affecting
              economic performance broadly, including areas such as global interdependence
              and trade policy, as well as the full range of issues associated with long run
              growth, business cycles and economic stabilization.
