Abstract    :
              9618668  Mogee  The proposed project addresses the question of the 
              replicability of assessments of relative national position  in science and
              technology (S&T) by comparing recent foreign  and U. S. forecasting reports to
              see whether assessments of  the relative standing of countries in key S&T
              fields are  consistent across the studies.  Particular attention will be  paid
              to whether other countries are reaching the same  assessments of U. S. relative
              position in key S&T fields as  reached by U. S. study efforts.  This approach
              takes  advantage of studies that have already been done, conducted  by
              different people and using a variety of methods.    The research is expected to
              result in a better understanding  of the comparability of recent national
              technology  forecasting and assessment reports, the consistency of their 
              assessments of national technological positions, and how  these assessments
              compare with a quantitative indicator  based on international patent data.  Of
              particular interest  from a science and engineering indicators perspective will
               be a comparison of the critical S&T fields identified in the  reports of
              different nations, a comparison of the relative  position of the U. S. key
              fields as assessed by different  countries, and a comparison of this ranking
              with a ranking  based on international patent data.  This information will 
              increase understanding of the quality of the assessments and  the confidence
              that can be placed in them.  ***
