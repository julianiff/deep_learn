Abstract    :
              9618193  Hirsch    The Core Plus Mathematics Project (CPMP), which was
              previously funded to develop materials for the first three years of high school
              mathematics, is developing materials for a fourth year.  The fourth-year course
              builds on the first three and continues the preparation of students for college
              mathematics, including those who will become professional users of mathematics,
              and for direct entry to the workplace. Materials for three one-semester courses
              are being developed.  The first semester course is intended for all students,
              the second course for students who intend to take calculus, and the third for
              students who do not intend to take calculus.  The third course will emphasize
              discrete mathematics, probability, and statistics.  A longitudinal study is
              being conducted that  follows students whose preparation in middle school
              mathematics is based on one of the NSF-supported, comprehensive middle school
              curricula and who then study high school mathematics using CPMP or another of
              the NSF-supported, comprehensive high school curricula.  The study also looks
              at the performance of students during the first year after completing high
              school.
