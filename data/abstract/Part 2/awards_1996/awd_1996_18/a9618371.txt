Abstract    :
              Rutgers U.   Initial studies of reforestation have emphasized ecological not
              human dimensions.  The current research project aims to explore the human
              aspects of reforestation in an old colonization zone in Ecuador's Amazon region
              which colonists first deforested thirty years ago.  Four factors are related to
              reforestation: urban development and the growth of part-time farming, declines
              in soil fertility, declines in economic returns from agriculture, and
              institutional policies which disadvantage smallholders and encourage land
              abandonment.  Current and former farmers in a four village region will be
              interviewed.  In addition studies of soil and vegetation will also be carried
              out.  Land use changes precipitated by political reform, pest infestation,
              aging among settlers and the lure of urban jobs will be emphasized.  The
              research will offer a detailed explanation for the turnaround in forest cover
              trends in the Upano-Palora region and also will suggest policy directions that
              might expedite reforestation in other deforested regions of the world.
