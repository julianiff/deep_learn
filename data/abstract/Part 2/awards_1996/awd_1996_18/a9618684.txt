Abstract    :
              9618684  Johnson       Organized collections of thunderstorms, known as
              mesoscale  convective systems (MCSs), have been identified as producers of 
              most of the rainfall in the tropics and mid-latitudes during the   Spring,
              Summer and Fall.         Under prior NSF support, the Principal Investigator
              has  exploited data sets from previously held field experiments to  further
              understanding of MCSs and their interactions with the  atmospheric boundary
              layer.  He will continue these investigations  using both numerical models and
              observational case studies.       The Principal Investigator will focus on
              processes which  initiate, maintain and modulate mesoscale convection as well
              as the  coupling between convection and the atmospheric boundary layer.  
              Specific objectives include:    Determine the climatology and initiation
              mechanisms for squall    lines over the U.S.;  1.   Extend previous research on
              the evolution of MCSs and their        surface pressure features to other
              seasons;  Continue studies of the characteristics of mesovortices.       If
              successful, this research will lead to better understanding  of MCSs which may
              lead to better predictions of timing, location  and amount of rainfall as well
              as severe weather.  ***
