Abstract    :
              9618142  Krasny    This proposal is to develop a set of in-depth,
              interdisciplinary,  grade 9-12 instructional modules that focus the application
              of the  four process standards (from the National Science Education  Standards)
              -- Science as Inquiry, History and Nature of Science,  Science and Technology,
              and Science in Personal and Social  Perspectives -- to the topic of
              environmental toxicology.  This  issue is important to students living in
              urban, suburban and rural  communities and all students using the materials
              will be  investigating problems relevant to their own lives.  The modules 
              include activities designed to engage students in three levels of  inquiry, 1)
              open ended laboratory exercises that focus on building  skills and
              understanding science concepts, 2) exploratory  investigations that give
              students the opportunity to investigate  variables related to their initial
              laboratory exercise, and 3)  controlled experimental research that uses the
              results of  explorations to define a controlled experiment with independent 
              variables.  Students learn to communicate their results among  communities of
              scientists and to the wider lay community.  The  topic of environmental
              toxicology is a focus of Cornell research  programs and the scientists from
              these programs will join with  teachers and educators to develop the materials.
               The outcome  includes teacher materials designed to assist teachers in making 
              the transition to inquiry-based science and to other aspects of the  science
              reform movement.
