Abstract    :
              Kraft, Robert  96-18351    Dr. Kraft will conduct an observational program 
              using the Keck telescope and the Lick 3-m  telescope to study the surface
              abundance of  certain light metals for stars within globular  clusters.  One of
              the many studies to be conducted  with the abundance data is in stellar
              evolution  and will provide constraints on the cause of deep-  mixing and
              whether it is driven by stellar  rotation.   Abundance data will also allow an 
              investigation of the degree to which primordial  abundance inhomogeneities are
              present in globular  clusters.  ***
