Abstract    :
              9618915  Lenhart    This award will provide partial support for the 1997 Barrett
              Lectures,   a conference to be held at the University of Tennessee from March
              20-  22, 1997.  Support will be provided for graduate students and recent  
              doctoral recipients.  The theme of the conference is Control Theory and  
              Applications.  The Barrett Lectures will feature control of ordinary  
              differential equations and partial differential equations and   applications.
              The program will include both plenary lectures and a   technical program,
              including both invited talks and contributed papers.    Applications to be
              addressed include manufacturing systems,   environmental problems, and
              optimization.
