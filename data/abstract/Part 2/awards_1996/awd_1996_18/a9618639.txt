Abstract    :
              Tufts University   This research proposal focuses upon spatial aspects of
              economies with interacting agents.  A hybrid approach is sought to construct
              models which combine fixed and a random topology of interactions.  It is argued
              that in depth studies of circular patterns of interaction are crucial for
              understanding diverse issues such as micro aspects of social structure and the
              emergence of monetary economies.  The model development emphasizes two
              empirical applications. First, a study of urban neighborhood dynamics in U.S.
              cities is proposed. Second, a study of the spatial aspects of the evolutionary
              behavior of the U.S. system of cities will be examined.  The neighborhood
              example will focus on the dynamics of residential segregation and equality as a
              way of understanding the dynamics of webs of interaction which constitute the
              structure of the urban economy.  PSID and AHS data are used within a spatial
              econometric framework to derive generalizable results and insights.  This
              analytical approach also allows the researchers to link their work to
              interacting agent theory.
