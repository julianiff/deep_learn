Abstract    :
              9618125  Wolfe         This project will compare seismic structure at two major 
              hotspots located in contrasting environments; Iceland, a mid-ocean  ridge
              hotspot located on young, thin lithosphere and Hawaii, an  intraplate hotspot
              located on old lithosphere. Regional and  teleseismic earthquake data will be
              used to investigate the effects  of hotspot upwellings on lithospheric
              structure and asthenospheric  flow.
