Abstract    :
                  9618260  Chen      A shallow-sea front situated at the outer boundary of
              Georges Bank constitutes the most prominent feature of the regional
              hydrography.  Although the front exists year round, its structure undergoes
              distinct seasonal changes.  Since this frontal zone also marks the boundary
              between mixed and stratified regimes, the juxtaposition of nutrient supply and
              stable water makes this a region of elevated biological productivity, with
              commepcial importance to the fishing industry.     Despite both the scientific
              and economic importance of such fronts, understanding of their dynamics and
              circulation is still fragmentary.   This award provides support for a
              two-pronged study of tidal regimes which will employ both analytical and
              numerical models.  The primary objective is to further our understanding of the
              physical processes that control the location, structure and circulation of
              shallow-sea fronts in general, and that over the Georges Bank in particular.  
              The results may provide guidance for developing parameterizations of sub-grid
              scale processes in three-dimensional simulation models.     Support for this
              award is being provided by the Physical Oceanography Program.
