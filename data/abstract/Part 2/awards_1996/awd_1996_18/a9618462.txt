Abstract    :
                  Webbink, Ronald  AST  96-18462    Dr. Webbink will carry out a program of
              research on the evolution of binary stars through studies   of the loss of
              systemic angular momentum.  His theoretical research program, in collaboration 
               with researchers at the Australian National University, will examine the
              phenomenon of   magnetic braking thought to drive angular momentum loss,
              particularly the dependence of stellar   wind mass loss rate on surface
              magnetic field strength, and of magnetic field strength on stellar   rotation
              rate.  He will also investigate the case of accretion onto strongly magnetic
              white dwarfs,   the effects of heating of the donor star by the white dwarf and
              accretion disk, and the effects of   white dwarf mass loss in novae explosions.
               In addition, he plans to publish a catalog of close   binary systems as an aid
              to further study of the systems, and to use it for population synthesis  
              studies and a search for high proper-motion eclipsing binaries that can be used
              for the   determination of fundamental stellar parameters.    ***
