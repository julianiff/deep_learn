Abstract    :
              Abstract  9618319  Novak  This CAREER Program award provides long-term support
              to measure the magnetic field configuration of the nucleus of our galaxy.  The
              technique used deduces the direction of the fields by measuring the
              polarization of submillimeter emission from gas and dust near the core of the
              galaxy.  Long grains of dust align themselves with magnetic field, which leads
              to a net polarization of the emitted far-infrared radiation.  Maps of the
              morphology of the fields will sensitively test models of galactic formation. 
              The project is particularly cost effective because it will make use of a
              telescope which will be at South Pole for other purposes and will extend its
              usefulness to over-winter operation.  As is expected in all CAREER awards,
              graduate and undergraduate students are involved with the hands-on experimental
              aspects of this challenging experiment, including working at South Pole.  ***
