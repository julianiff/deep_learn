Abstract    :
              Until just over 200 years ago, the normal human bite was edge-to-edge.  That is,
              when the molars were clenched together, the cutting edges of the upper and
              lower incisors met each other rather than overlapping as is now considered
              normal.  The change took place in Europe following the adoption of the dinner
              fork and the changes in eating habits it indicated late in the 18th century. 
              Because of the hiatus in Old World contacts caused by the American Revolution,
              that change did not begin to take place until the third decade of the 19th
              century in America.  A similar change should have occurred in Asia following
              the change in food preparation methods that allowed chopsticks, kwai-zi in
              China and hashi in Japan, to be used as everyday eating utensils.  Preliminary
              work in China indicates that the modern overbite occurred in upper class
              Chinese in the Song Dynasty.  Song cultural influences had a profound effect on
              life in Japan, and the purpose of this project is to test whether the adoption
              of Chinese food preparation and eating habits exemplified by the use of
              chopsticks was accompanied by a change from the edge-to-edge bite of the first
              Japanese farmers and their descendants in Yamato Japan which immediately
              preceded the first major influences from China.  These investigations will help
              clarify the relationships between diet, eating behavior, food preparation
              technology and normal occlusion of the dentition.
