                                          ABSTRACT                                            
                         OCE-9618729 / OCE-9701681           Chemical  oceanographers  and 
              marine  microbiologists  have  known  for  some  time now that trace metals in 
              seawater  affect  ocean  phytoplankton and bacteria differently depending upon 
              the  concentrations actual chemical forms, or species,  in  which  the  trace 
              metal is present.  Similarly, it is also known  that  such  organisms  are 
              capable  of secreting  complexating  agents  that  change   trace  metal 
              speciation,  making  them  more  or   less  assimilable  and more or less
              toxic.  It is known that  the  very  low  concentrations at which trace metals
              are present in  surface  waters   of   the  central  ocean  gyres  may  limit  
              biological  production, as has been demonstrated recently for iron.          
              In   this  project,  investigators  from  the  Woods  Hole  Oceanographic 
              Institution  and the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology will study these
              phenomena as a two-way street:  water  column  trace metals affecting oceanic
              microbial communities  and  oceanic  microbial communities affecting the water 
              column  trace  metal  chemistry.  The studies will involve field (Sargasso 
              Sea)  and  laboratory  studies with two species  of  cyanobacteria  and  their 
              biogeochemical relationship with cobalt, iron, and  copper  in  the  water 
              column.  The primary emphasis will be  on  cobalt  because  of  its  importance
              as a micronutrient  and  because  so  little  is  know  about its chemical
              speciation  in  the  oceanic  environment.
