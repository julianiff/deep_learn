Abstract    :
              The objective of this work is to develop a real-time leaf thickness  sensor and
              test it in the field. The sensor will be based on strain  gauges and will be
              small enough to rest on a leaf.  The sensor will be constructed from strain
              gauges attached to a strip  of material that is flexed via attachments to a
              leaf. Materials  (crystal, glass, or metal) for the sensor will be tested in
              the  laboratory for sensitivity and thermal effects. Field experiments will  be
              done to document the sensor's ability to measure leaf thickness in  response to
              diurnal variation in hydration state.  The significance of the research will be
              the development of a leaf  thickness sensor for use under field conditions.
              This will be a new  sensor that will yield new knowledge. It will find use as
              an indicator  of plant water status. In addition it will be a sensor to
              document leaf  development dynamics and the effect of stressors on leaf status.
              It  will find application in agriculture as a sensor for automated control  of
              growth conditions. Finally, it will find general use where variation  in the
              thickness of thin sheets needs to be measured continuously.
