Abstract    :
                  Bruenn, Steven  AST  96-18423    Dr. Bruenn's research program addresses
              several outstanding issues in the theoretical modeling   of core collapse and
              explosion of supernovae.  The collapse of the cores of massive stars is  
              thought to lead to the supernovae explosion through the release and transport
              of energy through   neutrinos and their influence on the propagation of shocks.
               Dr. Bruenn's research plan has three   objectives : 1) to carry out a
              detailed, semi-analytical study of fluid instabilities in the neutrino- 
              dominated region that controls the behavior of the shock in post-collapse
              supernovae, 2) to   perform 2- and 3-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations of
              the shock, with particular attention   to modeling the neutrino transport, and
              3) to explore a new explosion mechanism for core   collapse supernovae, which
              results from strong magnetic fields reducing neutrino opacities and  
              increasing heating behind the shock.  Each aspect of this research plan builds
              on previous efforts   by the PI and collaborators in improving semi-analytical
              descriptions and the implementation of   numerical simulations modeling the
              microphysics of the explosion mechanism.   ***
