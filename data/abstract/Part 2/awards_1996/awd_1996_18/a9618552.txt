Abstract    :
                        9618552  Mayer        Deposit  feeders  play several important roles 
              in  determining  whether  organic  material  is demineralized  or  buried.  
              These  animals function to make surfaces available for microbial  growth  and 
              move  particles both horizontally and vertically within  the  seabed  at  a 
              pace that far exceeds sedimentation.  The  central  problem  in  understanding
              deposit feeders  is  to  identify  the  materials that they utilize and to
              determine the sources of those  materials.  The interdisciplinary approach of
              this project is  to  combine  a chemical reactor theory of digestion with
              measurements  of   the  processing  of  enzymatically  available  amino  acids,
               focusing on rates of hydrolysis in, and absorption from, the gut.  In  vitro 
              and in vivo fluorometric methods will be developed  to  assay enzyme activity
              in the guts of small deposit feeders; these  methods  that will be applicable
              to planktonic animals  as  well.  Chemical  analyses and deposit-feeder
              bioassays will be conducted  to  test whether methionine or other essential
              amino acids become  more  limiting  in  laboratory simulations of diagenesis.  
              In  a  shallow   subtidal  site  the  hypothesis  that  the  holothuroid 
              Parastichopus californicus is limited to feeding during times  of  relatively 
              high methionine concentration will be tested.   At  a  200-m  site  the 
              hypothesis that the burrowing urchin  Brisaster  latifrons  will  show greater
              hydrolytic and absorptive  capacity  for amino acids after the spring bloom
              than during winter will be  tested.
