Abstract    :
                    Taylor, Joseph  AST  96-18357    Dr. Taylor will continue his research
              program based on radio frequency observations of pulsars.    High precision
              observations of pulsars provide insight into issues in stellar evolution,
              gravitation   physics, cosmology, fundamental astrometry, and time-keeping. 
              Dr. Taylor's observational   program will extend and improve a series of timing
              measurements of binary and millisecond   pulsars, with particular emphasis on
              measurements of general relativistic effects, continue   searches for new
              pulsars, especially those with short periods, obtain proper motion and parallax
                measurements for millisecond pulsars, and investigate the emission physics of
              pulsars through   polarimetric and single-pulse measurements.  His program
              includes a significant component of   instrument development and improvement
              and includes plans to take advantage of the upgrades   to the Arecibo telescope
              and the new Green Bank Telescope of NRAO.  ***
