Abstract    :
                  9618924  Gerard F. Consuegra    The Science Connections Project is a
              five-year professional development program for 320 middle schools science
              teachers in the county system.  The goal is to extend the revised elementary
              science program into middle schools and to provide the professional development
              at the middle school level.  The proposed project, in cooperation with the
              University of Maryland, The American Physical Society, and the National
              Institutes of Health will provide intensive training for middle school science
              teachers, Grades 6-8, so that students who were taught by elementary teachers
              participating in the NSF funded elementary teacher enhancement project will
              continue to develop science literacy skills and knowledge using inquiry-based
              and constructivist-based learning.    The middle school science teachers will
              receive professional development in science content; and instructional pedagogy
              which will include constructivist learning, cooperative learning, and
              inquiry-based teaching; performance teaching and assessment; and technology
              applications.  An action research model will be used to promote permanent and
              ongoing change in teachers' professional development.
