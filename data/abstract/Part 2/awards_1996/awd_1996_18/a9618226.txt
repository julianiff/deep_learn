Abstract    :
                    9618226  Smith    We   plan   a   geological,  geophysical,  and  
              geochemical  investigation of the Puna Ridge, the submarine extension  of 
              Kilauea  Volcano's  East  Rift  Zone.  Our  main  scientific  objective  is  to
               identify  and constrain  the  fundamental  processes  which  govern  the
              intrusion  of  magma  and  the  eruption  of  lavas  along a centrally-fed 
              rift  zone.  The  characteristics of rift zone morphology are  typically  used 
              to  infer  the  internal  architecture  of  volcanoes  which  underscores the
              broad applicability of this study,  and  the  importance   of   fully 
              understanding  the  formation   and  evolution of a volcanic rift zone. 
              Currently, the  controls  on the emplacement of dikes and the transport of
              magma along  a  rift,  the role of magma storage within the dike  system,  and 
              the  controls on the shapes, sizes, and styles of  lava  deposits  are not well
              known. Our multidisciplinary research  project will use a diverse suite of
              scientific techniques to  characterize and understand the processes acting at
              the Puna  Ridge,  including  the  analysis  of  high-resolution  swath 
              bathymetry and side-scan sonar imagery, near-bottom magnetic  profiles, digital
              photography, and samples collected by rock  dredging and glass coring.
