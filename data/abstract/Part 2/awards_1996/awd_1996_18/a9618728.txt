Abstract    :
              9618728  Fisk  Substantial evidence supports the view that microorganisms can 
              affect geochemical change in the atmosphere, hydrosphere and  sediments. Little
              is known , however, about microbial influence on  chemical change in the
              lithosphere. Recently, new evidence has  indicated that the alteration of
              basalts may be affected by the  presence of microbial life which influence the
              rate of alteration  and the composition of products.    The objective of this
              award is to test for microbes in basalts and  to determine the distribution and
              identity of these communities.  Initially basalts from existing collections
              will be screened for  carbon, nucleic acids, and textures that have been
              reported as  evidence of endolithic microorganisms. DNA or RNA will then be 
              extracted to further identify the organisms present.  ***
