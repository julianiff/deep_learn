Abstract    :
              This Research Planning Grant will explore the use of the Discrete  Element
              Method (DEM) in simulating deformation of accretionary and  extensional
              sediment wedges, in a manner analogous to that of  experimental sandbox models.
               In DEM simulations, each particle is  treated independently and interacts with
              all other particles  according to the laws of physics; the bulk behaviour of
              the  granular system therefore is obtained directly.  Physical and  mechanical
              properties of the particles and the system can be  measured and modified in
              ways not possible for analog sandbox  models.  The PI will modify existing code
              to permit the user to  interact with the model graphically, and will then apply
              the model  to examine the widely-used theory of critical taper in Coulomb 
              wedges.
