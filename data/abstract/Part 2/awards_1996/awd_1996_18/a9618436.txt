Abstract    :
                    A geophysical survey of the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge and Alpha Ridge are
              proposed for the 1997 SCICEX cruise to the Arctic Ocean.  Instrumentation for
              the 1997 cruise has been greatly augmented by a bathymetry system and a CHIRP
              profiler.  These instruments provide, for the first time, the ability to
              systematically map and characterize large portions of the Arctic Ocean floor. 
              Two unique, important and largely unknown structures of the Arctic Ocean, the
              Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge and the Alpha Ridge will be investigated.    The Arctic
              Mid-Ocean Ridge (AMOR) is the slowest spreading oceanic portion of the
              mid-ocean ridge system with total spreading rates of 0.63 to 1.33 cm/yr.  These
              spreading rates are so low that some models of mantle flow predict that no
              crust should be produced.  At present, the morphology and structure of the
              AMOR, and in particular its slower eastern portion, are almost completely
              unknown.    The Alpha-Mendeleev Ridge is a broad swell which extends for 200 km
              completely across the Amerasia Basin.  It is probably a hotqpot trace although
              a number of other origins have been proposed, and it appears to have been
              affected by tectonic as well as volcanic processes.  The tectonic fabric and
              structure of the Alpha Ridge and it role in the development of the Amerasia
              Basin are unknown.
