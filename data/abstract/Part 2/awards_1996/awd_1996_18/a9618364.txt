Abstract    :
                96-18364  Sneden, Christopher    Dr. Sneden will carry out a diverse program
              of research into  fundamental issues of stellar nucleosynthesis and the early 
              chemical evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy by obtaining  highresolution
              spectroscopy of key stellar populations in the  Galaxy's halo.  Galactic halo
              objects possess richly varied  chemical compositions, which provide fundamental
              clues to early  chemical and dynamical evolution.  The signature of abundances
              of  very heavy elements in the most metaldeficient stars reveal the  nature of
              the first generation of Galactic supernovae; the  abundance of light elements
              in globular cluster stars indicate  complex hydrogen nucleosynthesis and
              internal mixing in stellar  interiors;the interstellar absorption features on
              lines of sight  toward stars in the halo map out large interstellar clouds in
              the  Galactic halo.  Among the most interesting of Dr. Sneden's work  will be
              studies of the element Thorium, which holds the potential  to provide an
              estimate of the age of the Galaxy.  ***
