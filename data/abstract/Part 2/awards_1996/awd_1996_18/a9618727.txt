Abstract    :
              9618727  Bhattacharjee    The PI will personally recruit more than 50% of a
              group of 90  teachers to participate in the Biotechnology Program, Miami 
              University, Miami, OH.  The program will run from 1997 through 1999  at a cost
              of approximately $7500 per teacher.    The PI will give special attention to
              the recruitment of teacher-  teams from inner city sites.  However, teacher
              recruitment from  private, suburban and rural schools will occur, as well.  The
               format of follow-up sessions enables teacher-participants to invite  site
              colleagues to attend.  The hope is that colleague attendance  at follow-up
              sessions will encourage registration in subsequent  summer workshops, and
              generate site-support for currently  registered participants.  At least two
              follow-up sessions will  enable teachers to network, engage in proposal
              writing, share  ideas/supplies, and provide opportunities for identifying and 
              assessing various resources and mentors.    The PI will maintain avenues of
              contact with participants and  assist them with classroom implementation upon
              request.
