Abstract    :
                  Dappen, Werner  AST  96-18549    Drs. Dappen, Rogers, and Iglesias will
              continue their theoretical work on the equation of state for  stellar
              interiors.  Knowledge of the equation of state is of fundamental importance to
              the basic  physics of stellar structure and evolution.  The investigators are
              particularly focused on the use of  helioseismic data from the GONG project and
              the SOHO experiment to investigate and constrain  details of the equation of
              state.  They will also calibrate a relatively simple equation of state 
              representing the best physical description for use in a wide range of stellar
              applications.  ***
