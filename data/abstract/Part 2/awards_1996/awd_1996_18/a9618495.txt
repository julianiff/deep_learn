Abstract    :
              9618495  Smith    The project examines the physical structure, chemical
              composition and reactivity of soot particles important to atmospheric
              chemistry.  Different types of black carbon are generated within the laboratory
              through separate combustion  of common fuels.  The soot types are studied
              further as part of a number of laboratory-scale investigations that examine the
              interaction of these particles with water vapor and a variety of gas phase
              atmospheric pollutants.  The list of tasks to be undertaken includes: (1) the
              structure and the reactivity of soot generated from the combustion of different
              fuels; (2) study of the effect of unpaired electrons on soot surfaces and how
              these electronic characteristics influence the chemical behavior of soot
              surfaces; (3) ozone reaction/ decomposition on soot surfaces; (4) mechanisms of
              soot hydration; and (5) adsorption of O2 on the different soot types for a
              preliminary assessment of the soot adsorption behavior and reactivity with
              oxidants.   The suite of experiments to be conducted  will bridge the gap
              between the fundamental chemistry of soot particles and those reactions
              occurring in the atmosphere. The research will develop new information
              concerning the role of soot physical and chemical properties on the uptake of
              atmospheric water vapor and gas phase pollutants.                  ATM-9618495
