Abstract    :
                Beginning with the works of Anthony Downs (1957) and Duncan Black (1958), a
              large literature on voting in mass elections and voting in committees has
              developed that uses the mathematical tools of game theory to enhance our
              understanding of politics.  As these political events are often conducted by
              secret ballot, it is not surprising that this work on spatial models of voting
              has taken as given that voters cast their ballots simultaneously.  With a
              secret ballot, the order in which votes are cast is irrelevant because the last
              voter has no more information about the other ballots than the first voter. 
              However, several important types of elections are sequential in nature;  later
              voters can observe the votes or election results of earlier voters.  This
              proposal investigates the effect that these informational differences have on
              the behavior of voters who are late in the voting sequence.  This research
              develops a formal model in which voters start with private information about
              the quality of the candidates.  Voters can supplement this information with
              inferences drawn from earlier votes in the sequence.  Several extensions of
              this model are developed that capture some of the unique features of the
              presidential nominating process.
