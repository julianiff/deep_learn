Abstract    :
              9618029  Heid    Pennsylvania State University is developing, field testing, and
              revising a modular secondary school mathematics curriculum for use by students
              who have regular access to: calculator or computer technology that includes a
              linked computer algebra system (CAS) and dynamic geometry tool; 
              calculator-based data-gathering tools; and electronic  data bases.  The
              materials are developed in strands of content that are expected to consume
              six-to-nine weeks of class time; the strands could be put together sequentially
              to form a year-long course and several strands would be developed as
              stand-alone units usable in conjunction with some of the emerging NSF-funded,
              comprehensive curricula. Considerable attention is paid to preparing the pilot-
              and field-test teachers to handle the material and these experiences are used
              to develop materials to help other teachers use the instructional materials.  A
              comprehensive study is being made that will include an evaluation of the
              instructional materials and research into the level of students' understanding
              of the mathematics topics studied.
