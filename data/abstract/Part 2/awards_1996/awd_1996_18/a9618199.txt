Abstract    :
              Green  96-18199    The PI requests supplemental NSF funding for a Gordon
              Research  Conference on Rock Deformation at Colby-Sawyer College, New 
              Hampshire on August 10-15, 1997.  Dr. Harry Green is chair and Dr. Brian Evans
              co-chair of the  conference.  The conference is being held to bring together an
               interdisciplinary group of experts to discuss the interaction  between
              deformation and mineral reactions, a crucial aspect in  research into
              metamorphic and partially melted rocks that is  often ignored because the work
              crosses strongly developed  disciplinary boundaries.  Funds will be used to
              cover travel and  accommodation for students, post docs, and speakers.  It is 
              expected that a broad  and interdisciplinary cross-section of  researchers from
              academia, government labs, and the industrial  sector will participate  in the
              conference.  ***
