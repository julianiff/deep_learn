Abstract    :
                 Specific studies are designed to examine aspects of life history events in
              one of the GLOBEC target species, the copepod Calanus finmarchicus.  Individual
              vector models will be developed for life history events, population growth, and
              advective transport for C. finmarchicus in the Gulf of Maine and over Georges
              Bank.  Mandibular morphology and gonad development will be used to quantify the
              proportions of individuals that decide to enter diapause or to mature.  Tooth
              formation will also serve to indicate when stocks are ending or continuing
              diapause in autumn and winter months.  Diapause/maturation decisions and sex
              change frequency will be examined by analyses of DNA fragments.  These studies
              will document interannual environmental factors that influence sex
              determination.  Wax storage rates will be estimated by video microscopy and
              Iatroscan chromatography.   Work done by this project will constitute the
              western Atlantic component of a international program titled TransAtlantic
              Studies of Calanus finmarchicus.  Parallel studies on life history decisions,
              sex change frequency, and lipid storage will be conducted off Norway (two
              latitudes), Iceland, northern Scotland and in the North Sea.    +- ±-
