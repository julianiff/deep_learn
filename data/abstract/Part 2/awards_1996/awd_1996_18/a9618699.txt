Abstract    :
              Seawater circulates through the ocean crust and interacts with  minerals there
              and leaves chlorine (Cl) and fluorine (F) behind.   This is known from minerals
              that have been recovered from the ocean  floor.  The amount of Cl and F that is
              taken up by minerals is  probably related to the conditions within the sea
              floor, yet the  relationship between these conditions, such as temperature and
              the  abundance of Cl and F in the fluid, and the amount of Cl and F  deposited
              in the minerals is not known.  The investigators plan to  use laboratory
              experiments to determine how temperature and other  conditions control Cl and F
              in minerals.  These data can then be  used to interpret the conditions of the
              formation of the ocean  crust.
