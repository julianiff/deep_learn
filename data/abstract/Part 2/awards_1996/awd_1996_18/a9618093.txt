Abstract    :
              9618093  Rutherford    This project will involve the American Association for
              the Advancement of Science (AAAS) to continue the work of science education
              reform by developing an Atlas for Science Literacy, expand Resources for
              Science Literacy, and to support educators who want to put these tools, and
              others already developed by AAAS, to work in their states, districts, and
              schools.    The Atlas will produce "strand maps" that portray the sequence and
              structure of knowledge and skills needed for students to achieve particular
              science literacy goals.  Resources will:  provide aid to those developing
              science frameworks at district and state levels; develop workshop guides to
              help preservice and inservice teachers improve heir knowledge and skills in
              science, mathematics, and technology, along with their instructional skills;
              and extend the procedure for analyzing science materials to mathematics and
              technology materials.  Finally, the project will work with reform leaders on
              using these materials.    The third party evaluation by SRI will continue.
