Abstract    :
                Balachandran, Suchitra  96-18335    Dr. Balachandran will research stellar
              structure and chemical evolution using infrared echelle spectroscopy on several
              large telescopes.  Carbon and Oxygen abundances will be measured for metal-poor
              dwarf stars and giants to examine their variation with metallicity.  Iron and
              alpha process abundances will be determined in globular clusters in the
              Galactic Bulge.  Several other stellar evolution studies will be conducted,
              based on the comparison of observed and predicted CNO abundances and isotopic
              ratios in giants.  ***
