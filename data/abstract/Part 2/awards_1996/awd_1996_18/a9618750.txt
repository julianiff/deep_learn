Abstract    :
              The research is organized in terms of six tasks.  First, donor molecules   will
              be screened to produce conducting organic/inorganic   Langmuir-Blodgett (LB)
              films based on layered transition metal   phosphates.  Second, systematic
              studies will be carried out on model   systems to learn about the range of
              organic molecules that can be used to   form the mixed organic/inorganic metal
              phosphate LB structures. Third, a   determination will be made on how the
              functionalized organic molecules   pack in these assemblies.  Fourth, the
              inorganic lattice will be matched   to the organic molecules.  Fifth, methods
              for doping the thin films will   be investigated.  Sixth, each film will be
              structurally and physically   characterized.  With this award, the Synthetic
              Organic Program is   supporting the research of Dr. Daniel R. Talham of the
              Department of   Chemistry at the University of Florida.  Professor Talham will
              focus his   work on projects that center on the preparation of
              Langmuir-Blodgett   films that contain mixed organic/inorganic `dual-network`
              layered   systems.  These films will have conducting or superconducting
              properties
