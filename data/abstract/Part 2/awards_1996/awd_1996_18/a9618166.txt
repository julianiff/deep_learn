Abstract    :
              9618166  Moore         Fluid-rock  interactions  and  associated   tectonic- 
              hydrologic  processes exert fundamental controls on  crustal  evolution.  
              Accretionary  prisms   incorporate   fluid-rich  sediments   at   high   strain
               rates,   providing   natural  laboratories  where  tectonic and hydrologic 
              processes  are  accessible   to  drilling,  quality  seismic   imaging   and 
              monitoring. Evaluation of tectonic and hydrologic  processes  here  provides 
              models for deeper level  phenomena  in  both  active tectonic belts and more
              quiescent sedimentary basins.        Faults are conspicuous fluid migration
              conduits of the  northern Barbados accretionary prism. Fluids migrating along 
              faults  are  deeply  sourced,  alter  sediments  that   they  contact,   and 
              mediate  structural  processes.  A  recently  collected 3D seismic data volume
              in this area clearly images  the  plate  boundary  detachment or  decollement 
              fault  and  related  thrust splays.  As a follow-on effort  to  previous  work 
               on  this  Barbados  3D  seismic  volume,  we  propose  application  of seismic
              coherency analysis to  the  data,  a  revolutionary post-stack processing
              technique.   We  propose  to  investigate  the coherency signature of the 
              decollement  surface, the boundaries between reflection polarities  along  this
               surface  and any coherency anomalies within  areas  of  like  reflection
              polarity.  These analyses will  be  carried  out  at  AmocoOs Technology Center
              in Tulsa Oklahoma,  where  this processing technique was developed.  ***
