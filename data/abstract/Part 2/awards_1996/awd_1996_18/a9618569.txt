Abstract    :
              This three-year renewal will continue operation of the T-28 aircraft as a
              national facility.  The aircraft, maintained in a flight ready condition, will
              support NSF-approved atmospheric research projects requiring the capability to
              penetrate mature convective storms that may contain hail, lightning, intense
              turbulence or heavy icing conditions.  The agreement would provide for
              management, staffing, operations, maintenance, testing and enhancements of the
              T-28, as well as covering both the scientific and technical support for
              planning and data reduction phases of field projects.  Facility staff will
              contribute to the scientific analysis from the data collected in field programs
              and publish independent and joint research results.
