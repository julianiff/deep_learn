Abstract    :
              9618738  Kennedy    This proposal is for a Local Systemic Change project to
              improve  science teaching and learning in six school districts in Southwest 
              Washington State.  In the 5 year project, professional development  will be
              customized to meet the specific needs of the 402 grades K-6  teachers who each
              will receive over 140 hours enhancement over a  four year period to enable
              teachers to implement curricula and  teaching units consistent with the best
              inquiry based science  teaching.  Various levels of support for the teacher
              participants  will be provided by full time resource teachers and scientists
              and  engineers from the community who will be partnered with teachers to  act
              as a personal resource.  Partners include faculty from science  and education
              departments of Western Washington University,  personnel from local business
              and industry (e.g. Hewlett packard  and American Cyanamid) and the informal
              science community in nearby  Portland, Oregon.    A regional materials center
              will supply instructional materials  such as FOSS, Insights and Science and
              Technology for Children  (STC) for teachers.    The request is for $1,205,593
              with cost share estimated as $986,290  (82%).
