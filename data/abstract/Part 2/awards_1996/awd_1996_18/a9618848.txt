Abstract    :
              The   proposed  research  aims  to  provide  the  scientific  and  technological
                base  for  a  new  paradigm  for   human-computer  interaction,  one  that
              enables the principled design  of  multi-  modal  dialogue-supporting
              interfaces.  Two strands  of  previous  research  support this effort: research
              towards  building  novel,  collaborative  interfaces for automated graphic 
              design  and  the  development of explicit theories of collaboration.  The 
              proposed  research  addresses a key missing element of prior  research,  an 
              understanding of how theory can be integrated with  practice,  so  that  a 
              theoretical understanding of collaborative activity  can  inform  in  a 
              principled manner the design of concrete  software  interfaces.     The  
              research   comprises   three    activities:  specialization of the general
              theory of collaboration to  provide  a   framework   for  the  design  of 
              collaborative   interfaces;  application  of  the  theory to human-computer 
              interface  design  leading  to a set of design principles enabling system 
              designers  to  construct software elements that communicate well in multiple 
              modalities;   and   implementation  of   specific   collaborative  interfaces 
              in  a range of domains.  The proposed  research  will  contribute  to 
              fundamental research  in  communication,  to  the  development  of 
              collaborative human-computer interface  systems,  and  to training of
              undergraduates, graduate students, and  post-  doctoral fellows for work in
              multi-modal communication.
