Abstract    :
              9618867  London    This grant provides $34,230 as partial support of the costs
              of  upgrading the experimental petrology laboratory at the University  of
              Oklahoma.  Specifically, funds will be used to purchase raw  materials and to
              fund the in-house fabrication of approximately  20 cold-seal reaction vessels
              and furnaces to augment and/or  replace 18 aging cold-seal vessels that have
              been and continue to  be heavily used by both departmental and external faculty
              and  students.  Additionally, temperature controllers, pressure  transducers
              and other ancillary lab equipment needed for  hydrothermal experimentation will
              be purchased.  Renovation of  this laboratory will allow continued research on
              the geochemistry  of incompatible elements in granitic pegmatites and other
              silicic  magmatic systems.  ***
