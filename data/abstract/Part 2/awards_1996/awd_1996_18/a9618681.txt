Abstract    :
                Land reform has been portrayed as a remedy for rural instability in the Third
              World on the grounds that it alleviates the extremes of inequality that are
              thought to be the root causes of social instability.  However, rarely has land
              reform succeeded in abating an on-going civil war nor has land reform precluded
              revolutionary challenges from recurring in its aftermath.  Part of the problem
              is that agrarian reform is often accompanied by repressive violence.  Thus land
              reform must compete with repressive violence in the `struggle for the hearts
              and minds` of the peasantry.  This project tests a model of the competing
              effects of land reform and repressive violence on the political loyalties of
              peasants.  Data collected from El Salvador from the 1980s through the 1990s is
              used to test the model.  These data include election results, land reform
              beneficiaries, victims of repressive, insurgent and combat violence and
              national events over this time period.  These data provide direct empirical
              evidence on the widely accepted linkage between inequality and instability and
              the corollary proposition that land reform should restore rural stability.
