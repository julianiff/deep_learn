Abstract    :
                The goal of the project is to develop effective joint source-channel coding
              techniques.  The main objectives are to achieve a deep theoretical
              understanding of combined source-channel codes and to develop practical
              algorithms that can effectively be used in real applications such as
              low-bandwidth video compression and low-delay speech coding.  Very narrow
              bandwidth transmission channels, such as mobile cellular telephony, require
              efficient coding schemes to protect the transmitted source information from the
              corruptive effects of channel errors.  Some previous work on joint
              source-channel coding has yielded limited success at protecting source coded
              information.  In particular, low complexity techniques are needed for low delay
              real time implementations.  This project will investigate channel coding
              techniques for source coding applications with an emphasis on image, video, and
              speech coding applications.  A summary of the topics to be investigated is: 
              Classes of low-complexity redundancy free codes for discrete memoryless
              channels; error control coding will be incorporated into the source code design
              and the index assignment problem will be addressed for codes with redundancy. 
              High resolution quantizer theory will be studied for sources transmitting
              across noisy channels.  Some preliminary results give useful formulas for
              randomized index assignments, but a much stronger theory is needed for optimal
              index assignment.  Lattice codes will be studied both for quantization and
              channel coding.  A goal will be to develop efficient encoding algorithms for
              lattice source codes (respectively, decoding algorithms for channel codes). 
              Preliminary results so far have yielded very fast algorithms for the leech
              lattice, as well as some of the best-known low dimensional lattices.  Efficient
              decoding techniques will be developed for channel codes in Euclidean space
              using specific source coding information.  In particular, trellis decoding
              algorithms and theory will be studied for unequal input probabilitie s and
              unequal error protection.  This is currently an unsolved problem though
              extensions of techniques from traditional decoding algorithms have yielded some
              limited preliminary success.
