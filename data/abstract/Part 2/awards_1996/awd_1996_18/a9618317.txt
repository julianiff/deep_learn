Abstract    :
              The research analyzes the demographic and geographic structure, network
              dynamics, and material conditions of the transnational migrant community of
              Salvadorans in New York.  The project utilizes retrospective longitudinal data
              and methods to more fully understand the recent international migration of
              Salvadorans.  The study will be based upon data gathered in New York and El
              Salvador.  The research addresses the vital questions of forces that shape
              migration under contemporary conditions of economic, geopolitical and cultural
              change.  The work will advance our knowledge of migration theory and especially
              add to the literature on international migration.  The research is also
              designed to provide a unique perspective on migration from both origin and
              destination perspectives.  Methodologies include interviews, focus groups and
              statistical analyses.
