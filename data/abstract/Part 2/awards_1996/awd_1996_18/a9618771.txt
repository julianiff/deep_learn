Abstract    :
               9618771 Kahn This project addresses fundamental surface and interface issues in
              III-V nitrides, including the formation of metal-nitride barriers and
              heterojunctions, and the band offsets and electronic state density at these
              junctions. The approach is to link information obtained from a wide range of
              surface spectroscopy and microscopy techniques to electrical measurements on
              device-like structures. Both n- and p-doped GaN, AlN, AlGaN and In GaN layers
              grown by MOCVD will be used in the study. %%% The project addresses basic
              research issues in a topical area of materials science having high
              technological relevance, compact and efficient light sources in the blue-green
              spectral region.  The research will contribute basic materials science
              knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic
              devices.  Additionally, the fundamental knowledge and understanding gained from
              the research is expected to contribute to improving the performance of advanced
              devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for
              designing and producing improved materials, and materials combinations.  An
              important feature of the program is the integration of research and education
              through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically
              significant area. ***
