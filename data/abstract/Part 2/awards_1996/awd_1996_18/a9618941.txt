Abstract    :
              Example-based  machine  translation (EMBT)  searches  a  parallel  corpus of
              pre-translated texts for the closest match to each  new  sentence being
              translated.  Traditional EBMT works well only when  there  is  a very large
              relevant parallel corpus (e.g.  over  200  MB).   The  proposed investigation
              extends EBMT  by  generalizing  words   into   semantic   equivalence  
              classes,   by   syntactic  canonicalization  of  the  source  and  target 
              corpora,  and  by  composing  multiple  partial matches,  rather  than 
              selecting  a  single "best" match.  These new methods will be evaluated  in  at
               least  Spanish-English  and Korean-English  machine  translation.  Generalized
                EBMT  promises  to  produce  significantly   higher  accuracy translations
              than traditional EBMT, given the same  size  training  corpus,  or 
              alternatively  produce  equivalent-quality  translations   given  an  order  of
               magnitude  smaller   corpus.  Combining the inherently brief development cycle
              of EBMT with the  much smaller bilingual corpus requirement, makes generalized
              EBMT  the  future technology of choice for rapid deployment of  machine 
              translation to new, possibly exotic, language pairs.
