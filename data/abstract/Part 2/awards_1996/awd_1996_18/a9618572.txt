Abstract    :
                Undersea hydrothermal systems at mid-ocean ridges are of central importance to
              the solid earth geochemical cycle,  and also are the sites of large ore
              deposits of Cu and Zn and undersea oases of life.  Finding these systems is
              very difficult, because they are hidden under many kilometers of water. 
              Sediments from the ocean ridge system collect settling particles distributed
              through the water column by `plumes` of water rich in particles that rise from
              the hydrothermal vents.  The distribution of metal enrichment in sediments may
              help to determine where hydrothermal vents occur, how long they have been
              present, and how large a hydrothermal system is involved.  Because sediments
              can be collected easily from a ship on the sea surface, the sedimentary `halos`
              may allow an efficient assessment of the distribution and size of hydrothermal
              systems on a global basis.  If so, then our understanding of the distribution
              of hydrothermal activity, and the scientific processes responsible for it, will
              be substantially enhanced.  We propose to test the efficacy of this method
              using sediments, and to apply it to several first order problems relating to
              hydrothermal systems.
