              Abstract  ATM-9618913  Elsner, James B.   Florida State University  Title:
              Classification of Tropical Cyclones  The purpose of the proposed work is to
              extend previously successful  work on objective classification of Atlantic
              tropical cyclone  activity into two categories: 1) Tropical only, and 2) 
              Baroclinically influenced.  This work will extend the methodology  to other
              tropical cyclone basins such as Pacific basin.  The  research will involve a
              healthy combination of physical reasoning,  data exploration, and statistical
              analyses to determine whether  separation of tropical cyclone types can be used
              to better identify  and predict natural components of worldwide tropical
              cyclone  climate variability.  The successful completion of this work will 
              help understand the seasonal prediction of tropical cyclone  activity over the
              global tropical cyclone basins.
