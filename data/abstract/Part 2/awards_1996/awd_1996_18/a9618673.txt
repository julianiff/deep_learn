Abstract    :
              9618673  Housen    This project will identify the degree of diagenesis of
              magnetic  minerals in sediments from he Barbados, Cascadia and Nankai prisms. 
              Magnetic anisotropy can reveal deformation, but only if diagenesis  can be
              accounted for. The PI will compare magnetic, sedimentologic  and chemical
              properties of samples taken from the prisms with those  of equivalent age from
              cores seaward of the prisms.
