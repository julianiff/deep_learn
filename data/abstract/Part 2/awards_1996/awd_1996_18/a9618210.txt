Abstract    :
              An Investigation of Judgmental Reliability          The proposal deals with the
              effects of the reliability of judgment  (conceptualized as consisting of two
              parts--reliability of information  acquisition and reliability of information
              processing) on judgment accuracy.  The PI proposes a study of experts
              (radiologists reading mammograms) and a  lab study that is a loose analog of
              radiographic diagnosis.  The conceptual  framework is an expanded version of
              Brunswik's lens model.  The review of  the literature shows that the topic of
              reliability has been neglected in the  study of expert judgment, although it is
              known that there are individual  differences in judgment reliability.  The
              first study proposed would have 10 radiologists read a set of 100  mammograms
              twice.  They would also judge a set of features of each mammogram  twice to
              provide evidence about reliability of information acquisition.   The second
              study is an experimental analog in which subjects are given  visual cues or
              visual and numerical cues (such as age, etc.) which are  probabilistically
              related to an outcome.  Baseline and feedback trials will  be given.  Subjects
              will judge the outcome in some blocks of trials and will  judge the cues in
              other blocks of trials.  The criterion will be linearly  related to the cues in
              all cases.
