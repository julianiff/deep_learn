Abstract    :
               Quite recently, there has been a good deal of common interest among researchers
              in machine learning (whether it be algorithmic or neural net or genetic
              algorithms), in models of biological learning, and in statistics, all of which
              make inductive estimates of data dependencies.  It is still the case, however,
              that the different disciplines have their own terminology and approaches.  It
              is important to begin providing a common terminology and  framework for the
              different disciplines by investigating inductive principles, which provide
              general prescriptions for what to do with training data in order to learn a
              model.  There is just a handful of  known inductive principles 
              (Regularization, Structural Risk Minimization, Bayesian Inference, Minimum
              Description Length), but there are many learning methods - constructive
              implementations based on these principles.  This research project will  develop
              an understanding of  the differences among inductive principles, how they vary
              in power, and their use in model selection and the development of learning
              algorithms, in order to provide more solid foundations for the fields that are
              using them and better appreciation of the commonalities among the fields.
