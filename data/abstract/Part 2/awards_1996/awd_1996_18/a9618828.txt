Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to write a history of the engineering  profession in
              the German Democratic Republic (GDR).  The  investigation focuses on the
              professional ethos and social  identities of East German engineers, as well as
              on the ways in  which the state remolded the engineering profession after 1949 
              and used it to pursue its own technological and economic goals.  Though
              revolutionary changes took place in the engineering  profession after 1949, the
              professional ethos of many GDR engineers  was still framed by a memory of what
              the engineering profession  had been up to 1945 and what it still was in West
              Germany.  Drawing on archival materials, interviews, and sociological  studies
              conducted in the GDR, the study will examine five main  themes:  (1) the
              recruitment, education and deployment  of engineers;   (2) professional
              concerns, such as earnings,  professional power, career placement, and
              on-the-job training;  (3) the actual work experience of engineers, particularly
              in  research and development;  (4) the relationship between the  engineer and
              the Socialist Unity Party;  (5) the social ties,  status, and family life of
              engineers.  Throughout, the analysis  will be informed by an awareness that,
              despite official efforts  to ensure equality for women, those of working-class
              origins,  and young people, that such characteristics continued to be 
              important determinants of power, authority, and status.
