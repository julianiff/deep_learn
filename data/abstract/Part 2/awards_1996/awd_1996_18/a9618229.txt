Abstract    :
              Behavioral genetics is an umbrella term encompassing studies purporting to show
              a  connection between the genetic make up of an organism and its behavior. 
              Such approaches  have been applied to a variety of organisms, ranging from the
              relatively simple worm (C.  elegans), through the fruit fly (Drosophila) and up
              to humans.  Behavioral genetics  research, involving both humans and simpler
              animal model systems, has accelerated in recent  years.  Yet the advances of
              that research have been questioned on both conceptual and  methodological
              grounds, and have also been viewed as contentious by some because of the 
              social implications of the work.  The project will illuminate such issues by
              applying the tools and perspectives of analytic  philosophic to the arguments
              and evidence offered in the scientific literature of  behavioral  genetics. 
              Special attention will be given to the logical possibility of disentangling
              `genetic`  from `environmental` influences, and the evidence required to do so
              in a convincing manner. The  PI will also examine the causal claims made from
              various theoretical perspectives within  behavioral genetics(e.g.,
              developmentalist, interactionist, connectionistic, and classical 
              perspectives).  The project will result in a series of articles and a book,
              written for a variety of audiences  that include scientists and philosophers,
              policy makers, and the general public.
