Abstract    :
              The PIs will combine numerical and theoretical studies of turbulence generation
              and scalar spectra and  co-spectra of ion, electron and aerosol constituents
              caused by turbulence motions.  This should provide a theoretical understanding
              of small-scale structure and its connection to radar backscatter intensities
              and characteristics in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT).  The PI
              plans to address evidence for high Schmidt numbers at VHF and UHF frequencies,
              different backscatter intensities and characteristics at different frequencies,
              and influences of turbulence on pre-existing gradients of electrons, ions, and
              aerosols under polar summer mesopause and more general MLT conditions.
