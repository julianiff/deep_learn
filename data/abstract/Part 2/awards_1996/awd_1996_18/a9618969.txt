Abstract    :
              9618969  Giese    This four year project proposes to provide a total of 72
              secondary social studies teachers from Colorado in two cadres, selected in
              teams, with trainilg to enable them to integrate Internet resources and
              appropriate instructional strategies into inquiry-oriented, student-centered
              social science activities.  In addition the teachers would  receive training in
              leadership skills to enhance their roles as leaders in their home school
              building and districts.  This would be accomplished by selecting teams of from
              two to four teachers from the same school or district to attend a two week
              workshop followed by four-two day academic year sessions, a second one week
              workshop devoted to leadership in the second year with some additional
              follow-up during the second academic year. The project has projected a total of
              56.5% of the award as cost sharing.
