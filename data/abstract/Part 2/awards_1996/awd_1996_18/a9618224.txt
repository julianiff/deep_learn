Abstract    :
              9618224  Forsythe    Numerical modeling of self-consistent two-dimensional
              treatments of  solid mantle flow coupled with magma flow beneath mid-ocean
              ridges  will be undertaken in order to put constraints on the flow  processes
              occurring at this tectonic setting.  Specifically, a  model that incorporates
              chemical heterogeneity in the mantle will  be integrated into the flow model in
              an effort to understand the  complex geochemical signature of incompatible
              elements in mid-ocean  ridge basalts. The ability of the models to
              qualitatively explain  the composition of mid-ocean ridge basalts from diverse
              areas will  be tested and the results incorporated into geophysical models 
              interactively. This project represents a fully integrated,  collaborative
              effort designed to produce a theoretical model of  mantle flow and melt
              production beneath mid-ocean ridges that  reconciles the diverse constraints of
              major and trace-element and  isotopic composition of mid-ocean ridge basalts
              with seismological  and geophysical observations.
