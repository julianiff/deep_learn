Abstract    :
              9618356  Lundberg  This award will support collection and analysis of piston
              cores  from the transition zone between subduction and collision south of 
              Taiwan, in order to evaluate sedimentologic processes and evidence  of fluid
              advection during the early developmental stages of an  active arc-continent
              collision. Field work will be completed as  part of a joint project aboard a
              Taiwanese research vessel in which  Taiwanese scientists are examining the
              texture and physical  properties of margin sediments.     The significance of
              this project lies in the value of constraining  active sedimentary processes
              and fluid expulsion in modern, arc-  continent collision to provide a model for
              use in examining such  settings now incorporated into the continental record. 
              additionally, this work will provided the regional geologic context  within
              which to evaluate the results from deep sea drilling which  has been proposed
              for the Taiwanese margin.
