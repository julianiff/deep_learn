Abstract    :
                    This  combined  program will conduct a detailed  geophysical  and 
              geochemical  study  of  the Northern  Chile  Ridge  and  Valdivia Fracture Zone
              intra-transform spreading centers.  A  40-day  field program will use SeaBeam
              2000, magnetics,  and  gravity  to  map  the detailed geomorphology  of  the 
              axial  region   out  to  the  Brunhes-Matuyama  magnetic   reversal  boundary. 
               The  neo-volcanic zone will be sampled  at  ~125  sites  by dredging and wax
              coring; lavas recovered  will  be  analyzed  by  electron  microprobe, ICP-MS, 
              DCP,  and  mass  spectrometry for major element, trace element, and  Pb-Nd-Sr 
              isotopic  characteristics.  The combined data  set  for  the  Northern  Chile 
              Ridge  will  be  used  to  investigate  the  relationship  of  axial depth,
              crustal  structure  and  lava  composition  with  thermal effects  associated 
              with  large-  offset transform faults.  The Valdivia F.Z. data set will be 
              used  to  further investigate the extent and variability  of  anomalous 
              geochemical  features of  the  Southeast  Pacific  discovered  in previous
              studies of the Southern Chile  Ridge  (i.e.,  DUPAL  isotopic signatures and
              MORB with  subduction  zone  trace element characteristics) and to extend 
              on-going  studies  of  relationships between Pacific  mid-ocean  ridge  basalt
              chemistry and axial depth to deeper ridge segments.
