Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support to the National Academy of  Sciences for the
              Frontiers of Science Symposia.  The purpose of the  symposia are to promote the
              exchange of ideas among young  scientific researchers in disparate disciplines.
               In particular,  the symposia are intended to give outstanding young scientists
               exposure to frontiers research currently under way in areas other  than their
              own with the idea of providing the participants an  appreciation of the value
              and potential benefits of research in  different fields to their own work. 
              Also, these discussions would  transmit information about methods and
              instrumentation use in one  field to scientists in other fields.
