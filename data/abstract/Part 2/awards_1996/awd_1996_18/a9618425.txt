Abstract    :
              9618425  Turco    The project will construct, test, and apply a comprehensive
              model of global tropospheric aerosol microphysics, chemistry, and transport. 
              The model will include the formation, size evolution, composition, dispersion
              and removal of airborne particles and thus determine their distribution,
              optical, physical, and chemical effects. The research contains three tasks: (1)
              construction of a microphysics and optics model which treats a multi-component
              aerosol system and calculates wavelength-dependent optical depths; (2)
              integration of photochemistry with aerosol microphysics, including material
              fluxes between vapor and condensed phase; and (3) coupling of aerosol/chemistry
              model to a 3-D tracer transport code.  The aerosol model will be applied to an
              investigation of new sulfate aerosol particles that are formed in the remote
              marine atmosphere.  The model predictions will be compared with measurements of
              ultrafine particles during the Southern Hemisphere Marine Aerosol
              Characterization Experiment (ACE-1).  The validated and aerosol model will be
              used as a tool for predicting the chemical and climatic impacts of atmospheric
              particles on climate.
