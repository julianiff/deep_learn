Abstract    :
              9618784  McDuff  This award to University of Washington will provide new
              shipboard computers and a magnetometer system for use on the R/V Thompson, a
              research vessel operated as part of the University National Oceanographic
              Laboratory System (UNOLS).  The shared-use instrumentation supported here will
              assist researchers to conduct geophysical and oceanographic studies throughout
              the world ocean in 1997 and in future years.  ***
