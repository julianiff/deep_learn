Abstract    :
              9618017    Key    In  this project the PI will oversee the collection of about 
              400  water samples to be analyzed for radiocarbon (C-14, C-13) on  two 
              meridional sections in the western North Atlantic as an ancillary  contribution
               to  the World Ocean Circulation Experiment  (WOCE).  Two  hydrographic
              sections, along 52 deg W and 65 deg  W,  to  be  conducted  as part of the WOCE
              Atlantic Circulation  and  Climate  Experiment  (ACCE),  offer  an  opportunity
               to  sample   several  stations for the third time since the inadvertent
              injection of C-  14  into the ocean during A-bomb testing.  Previous sampling 
              was  done   during  GEOSECS  (GEochemical  Ocean  SECtionS)  and   the 
              Transient Tracer Observations (TTO) program.   Recent discoveries  have
              suggested more definitive ways to use these measurements  to  constrain
              circulation models.
