              E.  AST-9618705      Funds will be used to develop superconductive hot-electron
               bolometer (HEB) mixers for heterodyne receiver application  in the wavelength
              range from 1 mm to 0.1 mm (300 GHz - 3  THz).  The bolometer mixer consists of
              a submicron strip of  superconductor biased in the middle of its resistive 
              transition.  HEB mixers have recently shown broad IF  bandwidths ( > 6 GHz) and
              low noise along with extremely low  local oscillator power requirements (TR =
              650 K DSB and PLO  = 15 nW at 530 GHz).  Rapid thermal response and hence large
               IF bandwidth is achieved by out-diffusion of hot electrons.  This mixer has no
              energy gap limitation (as for example is  found in superconductive SIS mixers)
              and is expected to  operate up to several 10's of THz.  Device material, 
              geometry, transition temperature, transition width, and  sheet resistance will
              be investigated to optimize mixer  performance for applications directly
              related to current and  upcoming observational programs and missions. Nb
              bridges  deposited with improved conditions, and Al and Ti bridges  with very
              low transition temperatures will be tested to  produce receivers with enhanced
              sensitivity.
