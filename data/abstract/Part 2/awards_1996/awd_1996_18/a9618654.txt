Abstract    :
              9618654  Tabib-Azar  Silicon carbide offers many advantages in high power, and
              high temperature device applications.  Extended defects in epitaxial GaN are
              the main factor limiting its lifetime and its laser application.  Experimental
              studies of carrier diffusion lengths, surface recombination velocities, and
              extended defects in silicon carbide (4H, 6H, and 3C phases) and GaN will be
              carried out using electron beam induced current (EBIC) measurements as a
              function of temperature.  In 6H-SiC, micropipes will be extensively studied (in
              terms of an effective carrier lifetime and mobility in their vicinity) and they
              will be mapped in p and n-type epitaxial materials. Electrical passivation of
              these defects by oxidation (and by A1N in the case of GaN) will also be
              studied.  We expect to resolve micropipes and other defects with 0.5 (m
              dimensions.  Wafers with appropriate epitaxial layers will be purchased from
              Cree Corporation and using in-house fabrication facilities, supplemented with
              NASA Lewis Research Center's capabilities, both p-n junction and Schottky diode
              structures will be fabricated.  PI's characterization facility is well equipped
              with high- and low-frequency capacitance meters, device parameter analyzer,
              deep-level transient spectrometer, and other relevant equipment.  In addition
              to the above facilities we will use the EBIC apparatus at NASA Lewis Research
              Center.  ***
