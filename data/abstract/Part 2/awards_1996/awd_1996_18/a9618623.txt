Abstract    :
              AST-9618623    Chemistry of the Galactic Bulge.    Dr. McWilliam will analyze
              spectra of 100 K giant stars in the  bulge of the Galaxy in order to address
              the following questions:  What is the average  Fe/H  ratio of giant stars in
              the Galactic  bulge?  Is this ratio similar to the solar neighborhood 
              indicating no radial abundance gradient in the Galaxy's disk or  is it higher
              than the solar neighborhood, suggestive of a  gradient?  Is the formation
              timescale of the bulge less than 1  billion years or is it closer to 4-5
              billion years?  Which type  of supernova was the dominant contributor to the
              chemical  enrichment of the bulge?  ==========================================
