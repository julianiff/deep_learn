Abstract    :
              9618990  DiRanna    This project sponsored by WestEd - formerly the Far West
              Laboratory  will carry out a four-year project which will prepare Middle School
               Teachers to implement exemplary science materials in the Middle  School
              classroom.  Altogether, 100 schools will participate in the  program and will
              select two teachers who will be prepared by the  project to become lead
              teachers.  In the first year, these lead  teachers will receive instruction to
              provide them with the content  knowledge and teaching skills so that they will
              be able to use  exemplary materials in their classrooms.  Their duties upon 
              returning to the classroom will be to use the new materials,  network with
              other participants, work with colleagues to implement  the materials school
              wide and to work with student parents and  school administrators to make them
              aware of the reform goals.  In  the second year the lead teachers continue with
              their summer  institute and in the school year through 50 hours of on-site 
              professional development, work with their colleagues to continue  the process
              of implementing the same two units.  In the two ensuing  years the same
              activities take place so that by the end of the  project, the 200 lead teachers
              will have had 800 hours of in-  service and have introduced eight new science
              modules into the  classroom.  In addition, 2-4 more teachers from each of the
              schools  will have had 308 hours of in-service and will eventually introduce 
              the same modules into their classrooms.  All other teachers in  these schools
              who teach science will have had 168 hours of in-  service to prepare them also
              to teach the modules.  The lead  teachers will disseminate the activities to
              other schools in the  state.  Activities for parents and administrators will
              take place  all four years.  Over the life of the project, 1276 teachers and 
              120 administrators will have been served by the program.
