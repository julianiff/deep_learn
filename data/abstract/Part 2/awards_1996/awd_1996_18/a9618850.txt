              F.  AST-9618850      Funds will be used to adapt the Steward Observatory Mid- 
              Infrared Array Camera (MIRAC2) for operation on the up-  graded, single mirror
              "MMT" (Multiple Mirror Telescope).  Modifications include modification of the
              cryostat case and  guider box, provision of an interface structure to the MMT, 
              and modifications to the image acquisition and processing  circuitry and
              software.
