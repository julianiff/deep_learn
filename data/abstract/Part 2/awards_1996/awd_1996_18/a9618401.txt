Abstract    :
              Abstract  OCE 96-18401 (University of Hawaii: J. Karsten/F. Martinez)  OCE
              96-18736 (Duke University: E. Klein)  This  combined  program will conduct a
              detailed  geophysical  and  geochemical  study  of  the Northern  Chile  Ridge 
              and  Valdivia Fracture Zone intra-transform spreading centers.  A  40-day 
              field program will use SeaBeam 2000, magnetics,  and  gravity  to  map  the
              detailed geomorphology  of  the  axial  region   out  to  the  Brunhes-Matuyama
               magnetic   reversal  boundary.   The  neo-volcanic zone will be sampled  at 
              ~125  sites  by dredging and wax coring; lavas recovered  will  be  analyzed 
              by  electron  microprobe, ICP-MS,  DCP,  and  mass  spectrometry for major
              element, trace element, and  Pb-Nd-Sr  isotopic  characteristics.  The combined
              data  set  for  the  Northern  Chile  Ridge  will  be  used  to  investigate 
              the  relationship  of  axial depth, crustal  structure  and  lava  composition 
              with  thermal effects  associated  with  large  offset transform faults.  The
              Valdivia F.Z. data set will be  used  to  further investigate the extent and
              variability  of  anomalous  geochemical  features of  the  Southeast  Pacific 
              discovered  in previous studies of the Southern Chile  Ridge  (i.e.,  DUPAL 
              isotopic signatures and MORB with  subduction  zone  trace element
              characteristics) and to extend  on-going  studies  of  relationships between
              Pacific  mid-ocean  ridge  basalt chemistry and axial depth to deeper ridge
              segments.
