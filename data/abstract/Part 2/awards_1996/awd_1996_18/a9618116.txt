Abstract    :
                Rasio, Frederick  AST 96-18116    Dr. Rasio will carry out a program of
              research into the phenomena associated with close   dynamical interactions
              between stars in dense stellar systems and in binary systems.  In   simulating
              interactions in dense stellar systems, he will explore the effects of
              hydrodynamic   mixing in the production and evolution of blue straggler stars,
              the stability and evolution of   contact binaries, and the dynamical evolution
              of the cluster system.   By exploring interactions   and the coalescence of
              binary stars, particularly neutron stars, he will investigate the sources of  
              gamma-ray bursts, the release of gravitational radiation, the mechanisms of
              Type Ia supernovae,   and characteristics of extra-solar planets.    ***
