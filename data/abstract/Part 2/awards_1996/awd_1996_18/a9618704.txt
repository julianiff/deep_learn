Abstract    :
              AST 9618704    Analysis of Near-Infrared ILS Spectroscopy for Planetological 
              Application.    Drs. George Atkinson and Jonathan Lunine will use intracavity 
              laser spectroscopy (ILS) in the laboratory to detect and  characterize weak
              absorption features in the 1-3 micron  wavelength range from molecules
              associated with planetary  atmospheres, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen, and
              methane.  The  ILS technique presents a great advantage over other methods of 
              characterizing molecular line parameters:  1) it achieves very  large effective
              pathlengths without large physical pathlengths  and/or volumes of gases; and 2)
              weak features that are  inaccessible to other techniques can now be studied. 
              The  experimental conditions to be examined reproduce those under  which
              astronomical observational data were recorded.  The  opportunity to
              quantitatively mimic astronomical observational  data is derived from the
              extremely high detection sensitivity and  versatility with which ILS techniques
              can be used.  =========================
