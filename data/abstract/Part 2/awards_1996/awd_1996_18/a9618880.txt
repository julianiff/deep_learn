              AST-9618880      An existing CCD system will be modified for the detection of 
              pulsations in the optical light of isolated, rotation  powered pulsars.  The
              detection of pulsations will 1.  provide unambiguous identification of the
              optical  counterpart of pulsars where the counterpart is believed to  be known
              and in those where it is definitely not; 2.  distinguish between thermal and
              non-thermal emission  mechanisms producing the optical light; 3. allow a 
              measurement of the temperature of old neutron stars which  are weak or absent
              in the X-ray band; and 4. permit a search  for evidence of heating by exotic
              processes such as magnetic  monopoles.
