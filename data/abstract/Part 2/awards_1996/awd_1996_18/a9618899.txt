Abstract    :
              AST-9618899    Collaborative Project: Integrated Models of Star Formation.   
              This project involves the construction of integrated models of  star formation
              through collaborative efforts of the astrophysical  theory groups at the
              University of California at Berkeley and New  York University headed by Frank
              H. Shu and Alfred E. Glassgold  respectively.  The work will build on Shu's
              expertise in  magnetohydrodynamics and Glassgold's expertise in atomic and 
              molecular physics.  The integrated theory must encompass not only  a
              description of the system's magnetohydrodynamics, but also its  physical state.
               Both of these are critical for the radiation and  chemical diagnostics of
              young stellar objects and the planetary  systems that they may harbor.  The
              project has the ultimate  objective of producing critical observational tests
              of the theory  that can exploit the improved capability in angular and spectral
               resolution that will become available in the next decade.
