Abstract    :
              The research has two objective.  One is to quantify the amount of risk sharing
              among OECD and European Community (EC) members, with the goal of assessing
              whether existing market and EC institutions provide sufficient insurance
              against country specific shocks.  The other is to compare the degree of capital
              and credit market integration in the United States, a successful monetary
              union, with that of OECD and EC countries.  The construction of a data set from
              1966 to 1992 will be completed which includes data by country on net factor
              income flows, GDP, GNP, capital depreciation, personal income, corporate
              profits, etc.  Then, a decomposition analysis of the cross-sectional variance
              in the Gross Domestic Product of OECD and European Community countries will be
              undertaken.  Quantifying the amount of income and consumption smoothing
              achieved at various levels, within various groups of countries, during various
              time periods, and using various different frequencies will also be undertaken. 
              Computer programs tailored specifically for the statistical methods employed in
              this project will be developed.  This research is important because the results
              will increase the understanding of risk sharing mechanisms among OECD and
              European Community Countries.  The comparison with the US experience will
              provide potential lessons for the process of European unification.
