Abstract    :
                Cohen and Sackrowitz  9618715    A classical protocol for the evaluation of a
              treatment is to administer a  placebo to a set of individuals and  administer
              the treatment to another set of individuals.  Oftentimes the response variable
              is an ordered categorical variable such as no improvement, partial improvement,
              complete recovery.  The researcher is  interested in answering the question: Is
              the treatment "better" than the control?  Many recommended  testing procedures
              that are directed towards this question are found to be wanting.  Among these
              are the  likelihood ratio test and the Wilcoxon-Mann, Whitney test.   The
              research involves a review of various  definitions of "better" and the
              development of improved testing procedures.  The new procedures are  computer
              assisted and are shown to have desirable theoretical and practical properties. 
                  The determination of whether or not a new product or new treatment or new
              method is better than a  standard is a fundamental issue in a variety of areas
              including biotechnology, materials, manufacturing,  and the social sciences. 
              Current methods used to make decisions in these situations are found to be
              either  inappropriate or, in many instances, weak in their ability to detect a
              superior product.  The investigators  study decision procedures based on a new
              approach which is effective in eliminating the shortcomings of  previous
              methods.  Theoretical arguments as well as extensive numerical calculations
              support the findings  and demonstrate the magnitude of the improvements.
