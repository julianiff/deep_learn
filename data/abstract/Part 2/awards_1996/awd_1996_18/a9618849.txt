              A.  AST-9618849      Funds will be used to design, build and install two- 
              dimensional fiber-optical arrays into the 9m Hobby-Eberly  Telescope's Medium
              Resolution Spectrograph.  Two arrays will  be built to optimize integral-field
              spectroscopy for  kinematic studies of individual nearby and moderately 
              distant galaxies.  One array spans over 30 arcsec using 1  arcsec fibers to
              densely sample slits at 4 position angles  (R < 10,900).  The second array
              spans 15 arcsec using 0.5  arcsec fibers to densely sample a core area of ~60
              square  arcsecs (R < 21,800).
