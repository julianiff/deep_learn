Abstract    :
              9618770  Bybee      This project, to be conducted under the auspices of the NRCs
              Center for Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Education (CSMEE) will
              continue work in the area of standards-based reform through a three-pronged
              strategy:  1. A dissemination strategy will build the capacity on the part of
              major science education professional organizations such as the National Science
              Teachers Association (NSTA), The Council of State Science Supervisors (CSSS),
              and the National Science Education Leadership Association (NSELA).  The Center
              will continue a speaker's bureau, presentations to the education community, and
              a series of articles in non science education journals.  2. A series of addenda
              to the Standards will be developed to focus in depth on issues raised in the
              Standards; and  3. A process will be developed to determine evidence for the
              influence of standards-based reform in mathematics and science.  The resultant
              framework will be used to make periodic reports on the status and effect of
              standards-based reform.
