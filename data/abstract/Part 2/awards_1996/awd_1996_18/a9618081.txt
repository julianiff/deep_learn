                                        ABSTRACT  ALLEN, M.  National Academy of Sciences 
              AST-9618081    The Space Studies Board of the National Academy of Sciences 
              will assemble a task group on ground-based solar research.  The study will
              analyze existing capabilities and projected  trends in ground optical and radio
              observational facilities  and other research infrastructure elements.  The
              study will  require approximately 12 months.  A final report will be  delivered
              by July 1, 1997.
