Abstract    :
              The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program support Martin F. Jarrold in   his
              continuing studies to determine the structure of medium-sized   clusters using
              gas phase ion mobility measurements.  The speed with which   a gas phase ion
              moves through a buffer gas under the influence of a weak   electric field
              depends on its geometry.  Although some information about   the geometries can
              be deduced from the mobilities, more than one geometry   can have the same
              mobility.  Thus, Jarrold proposes to couple a   recently-constructed high
              resolution apparatus with a magnetic-bottle   anion photoelectron spectrometer.
               Using this approach, photoelectron   spectra will be measured as a function of
              geometry and cluster size for   carbon, silicon, and germanium clusters of up
              to hundreds of atoms.   Atomic clusters are small pieces of material containing
              from a few to   several thousand atoms.  For a variety of reasons, the physical
              and   chemical properties of these species are different than those of the bulk
                material.  Examining the properties and determining how they change as a  
              function of cluster size has been the object of a major research effort   for
              the last ten years.  Structure generally controls the physical and   chemical
              properties of any material.  Thus information about the   geometric structure
              of atomic clusters is critical for understanding   their size-dependent
              properties.  These studies will substantially   increase our understanding of
              the structure and bonding in clusters of   the Group 4 (carbon, silicon and
              germanium) elements.
