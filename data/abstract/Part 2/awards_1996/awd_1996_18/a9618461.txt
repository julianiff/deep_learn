Abstract    :
                Richards, Mercedes  AST  96-18461    Dr. Richards will continue her studies of
              mass transfer in close interacting binary systems.  She   will analyze a large
              amount of observational data on Algol binaries at a variety of wavelengths,  
              including spectroscopy in the ultraviolet, visible, and radio, and photometry
              in the infrared, often   in simultaneous observation campaigns.  A variety of
              techniques are used to investigate the mass   transfer in these systems
              including study of the orbital variation of line strengths, analysis of the  
              radial velocity variation of the emission in difference profiles, and Doppler
              tomography to   produce reconstructed images of the binary.  The PI will also
              continue studies of Algol systems   through two- and three- dimensional
              hydrodynamic simulations to aid in the interpretation of the   Doppler
              tomography maps.  The ultimate goal of the research is to determine the range
              of mass   transfer rates in Algols, and, in selected magnetically active
              systems, to study how magnetic   fields influence the mass transfer process and
              evolution of the binary.  ***
