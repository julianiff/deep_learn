Abstract    :
              The contributions of Isaac Newton to the development of modern science and its
              methodology  were epoch-making.  Yet in his lifetime Newton chose to publish
              only two  books and a few papers.  Only in the past generation, with the
              publication of his  Correspondence (1959-77) and Mathematical Papers (1967-81)
              has even a portion of the vast  quantity of his surviving papers have become
              known and studied.   These unpublished works have  been of great historical
              value, significantly enriching and modifying our interpretation of his  life
              and works, as well as that of early modern science.  During his career Newton
              treated a broad range of optical topics, including color and  refraction,
              interference phenomena, the construction of optical instruments, and the nature
               of light.  Because Newton's optical investigations are so fundamental to his
              own  scientific development, and to an understanding of the development of
              science, it has  been widely recognized than an edition of his optical papers
              is sorely needed.  In 1984,  with support from NSF, I published the first
              volume of a three-volume edition of The  Optical Papers of Isaac Newton, and
              the current project will prepare volumes 2 and 3 for  publication.
