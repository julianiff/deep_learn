Abstract    :
              9618703  LEINEN  The NSF-owned Research Vessel ENDEAVOR has been operated under
              a  charter party agreement by the University of Rhode Island since it  was put
              into service in 1976.  This project extends the  Institution's operation of the
              ENDEAVOR for five years under an  updated, modified charter party agreement.
