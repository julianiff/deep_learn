Abstract    :
                Lamb, Frederick  AST 96-18524    Drs. Lamb, Pethick, and Shapiro will carry
              out a diverse research program that addresses a wide   variety of projects
              within a common theme of understanding the physics of compact objects.  In  
              particular their work will involve the exploration of the properties of matter
              under extreme   conditions and strong-field gravitation.  Among the projects
              the investigators will address are   studies of superfluidity in nuclear and
              neutron-star matter, properties of matter in the inner crusts   of neutron
              stars, disk accretion in a variety of contexts, stellar dynamics in disks, in
              non-spherical   clusters, and in binary systems composed of neutron stars,
              supernovae collapse, and massive   black holes in the context of active
              galactic nuclei.  The PIs will use both large-scale   computations and analytic
              modeling to carry out their theoretical investigations.  ***
