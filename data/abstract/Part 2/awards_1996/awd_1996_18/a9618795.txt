Abstract    :
                Tamas Gombosi  AST-9618795    Dynamics of Cometary Environments.    Dr.
              Gombosi will apply recent advances in computational  methods to develop and
              apply new modeling tools for cometary  science.  He expects to develop a
              multiscale, self-  consistent model of a cometary atmosphere.  He will use a 3 
              dimensional model of the plasma and the gas about a 3  dimensional nucleus. 
              The model of the cometary coma will  incorporate the solar wind interaction,
              the neutral gas and  dust transport, and the formation and chemistry of pick-up
               ions.  =================================
