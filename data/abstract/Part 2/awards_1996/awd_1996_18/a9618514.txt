Abstract    :
                The AMS-IMS-SIAM Joint Summer Research Conferences in the  Mathematical 
              Sciences were begun in 1982. Between six and ten one-week (or  occassionally 
              two-week) conferences have been held annually since then on  topics from a 
              wide range of active research areas in the mathematical sciences.  This  grant
              provides funding for the next three years of conferences,  1997  through 1999. 
                The conferences in 1997 will be held at the University of  Washington, 
              Seattle. The topics, with the chair(s) of the organizing  committees, are:     
                 "Applications of curves over finite fields" - Michael Fried        
              "Representation theory of real and p-adic reductive groups"  -            Allen
              Moy         "Algebraic K-theory" - Wayne Rasking, Charles Weibel        
              "Graphical Markov models, influence diagrams, and Bayesian  belief           
              networks" - Michael Perlman, David Madigan         "Statistics in molecular
              biology" - Francoise  Seillier-Moiseiwitsch         "Trends in representation
              theory of finite dimensional  algebras" -            Birge Huisgen-Zimmerman,
              Edward L, Green         "New developments and applications in experimental
              design" -            William F. Rosenberger, Timothy O'Brien
