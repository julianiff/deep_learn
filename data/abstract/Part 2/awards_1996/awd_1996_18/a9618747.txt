              LICHTENBERGER, A. W.  AST-9618747      Funds will be used to support four
              initiatives in the  development of Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor
              (SIS)  mixers for submillimeter radioastronomy receivers.  In the  first of
              these tasks integrated balanced Nb mixer circuits  will be developed to reduce
              atmospheric and local oscillator  noise in SIS receiver systems.  Micromachined
              SIS mixer  circuits will be investigated as a basis of receiver design  for
              observing extended sources.  Traveling wave mixers based  on Nb/Al edge
              junctions will be fabricated and evaluated.  In the fourth task ion beam
              etching techniques will be used  to produce bolometric mixers with very small
              dimensions.
