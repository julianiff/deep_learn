Abstract    :
              9618891  Fiddy  Optical storage in photorefractives is now the focus of a large
              national effort, through PRISM (Photorefractive Information Storage Materials
              consortium).  One of the major problems in using volume storage media that they
              face is that of selective fixing and erasing.    The PI's are of the opinion
              that a straightforward method to achieve these requirements is possible using
              the much more readily available material of lithium niobate.  They propose to
              show that one can optically address doped lithium niobate in such a way that
              one can locally heat a small volume interior to the crystal, while writing
              simultaneously the information to be stored.    Such an approach assumes local
              storage of information holographically, thereby minimizing the cross-talk
              between the set of "pages" written in one volume as they are written and read
              through adjacent volumes.  A laser induced heating effect allows for
              non-mechanical beam steering, which is another desirable attribute of volume
              storage media.    In order to demonstrate the principle of this idea, we would
              first use an inexpensive and not particularly compact carbon dioxide laser to
              perform the localized heating.  ***
