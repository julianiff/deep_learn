Abstract    :
              9618442  Dick  This award will support a marine geological and geophysical study
               of exposed lower ocean crust in the southwest Indian Ocean. Exposed  crustal
              rocks on shallow uplifted seafloor were discovered in this  region during Ocean
              Drilling Program operations. ODP site 735B  sampled a 400 meter vertical
              section of gabbros in this area  providing a detailed record of crustal
              formation processes. To date  , however, it has been difficult to place these
              results into a  local context since no data are available on surrounding
              seafloor  geology. The present project will rectify this situation by 
              undertaking detailed near bottom observations and sampling.  Canadian
              scientists will provide the ROV ROPOS as primary survey  vehicle, and rock
              drill would be modified for deployment on ROPOS  to allow direct sampling of
              observed rocks.The primary objective is  to provide detailed near bottom
              examination and sampling of  seafloor to tie existing ODP data to local
              environment and to  provide detailed site survey for drilling to be proposed
              which  would sample at sites surrounding existing hole. Additional work  would
              include newly developed British rock drill to provide deeper  sampling than
              could be done from ROPOS vehicle. Samples and data  would be used to identify
              crustal formation process at this unique  exposure of lower crustal rocks.  ***
