Abstract    :
              9618821  Marin    This project, sponsored by City College of New York in
              partnership with New York City School District #2 is a three year project which
              will enhance Middle School teachers in science content based upon nationally
              validated science curriculum materials.  Each year 60 teachers from grades 5-9
              will be provided an equivalent of seven weeks of in-service activities which
              will strengthen the teachers' content knowledge, allow them to carry out
              inquiry strategies in the classroom and develop leadership capabilities so that
              they will be able to do in-service activities with peer teachers.  A group of
              these teachers will continue to participate in the program in ensuing years. 
              As a result of the project it is expected that the district will develop a
              comprehensive Middle School science curriculum framework, provide the school
              with exemplary science materials, provide in-service opportunities to all
              teachers and set up two permanent Science & Technology Instructional Centers
              for the teachers in the District to use as a resource.    Matching funds
              constitute 33% of the NSF award.
