               AST-9618798      Funds will be used to upgrade the detector for the Sunyaev- 
              Zel'dovich Infrared Experiment (SuZIE) to SuZIE II which  includes a larger
              format detector array and an additional  frequency channel.  These
              modifications are expected to  enable SuZIE II to reach scientific goals which
              include (1)  measurement of the peculiar velocity field at z> 0.1 with a 
              precision of ~ 250 km/sec; (2) measurement of the arcminute  scale anisotropy
              of the cosmic microwave background with a  precision of delta T/T of < 2 x 10
              exp(-6); (3)  determination of a value for the Hubble Constant based on a 
              sample of clusters chosen to minimize selection bias; (4)  determination of the
              number density of high redshift  clusters; and (5) characterization of the
              confusion due to  unresolved sources in degree-scale cosmic microwave 
              background anisotropy measurements.
