                  Abstract      Proposal No.:       CTS-9618582  Proposal Type:     GOALI

                 University of Utah      This grant is awarded through the Separations and
              Purification Program sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations
              Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division.  The principal
              investigator is Jan D. Miller of the University of Utah.  The research will be
              carried out by the University of Utah in collaboration with Shell Chemical
              Company.  The objective of the proposed program is to adapt atomic force
              microscopy (AFM) to the determination of interparticle forces between
              particulate suspended in wastepaper deinking systems.(wastepaper pulping and
              deinking flotation systems).  Importantly, the results from such research will
              establish the aqueous solution chemistry for effective deinking of wastepaper,
              particularly laser-printed and xerographic wastepaper's.  On this basis, it is
              expected that a simple reliable and relatively inexpensive flotation technology
              can be developed.    Technology development for the deinking of wastepaper,
              particularly laser-printed and photocopied office waste, has become an
              important environmental and process issue for the paper recycling industry. 
              The development of a novel, inexpensive, and more efficient process for
              utilization of waste paper from modern printing processes is needed.  Such
              development will be facilitated by fundamental surface chemistry research to
              establish a basis for technology innovation.
