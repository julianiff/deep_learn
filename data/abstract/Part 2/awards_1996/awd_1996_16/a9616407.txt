Abstract    :
              This award will support the final year of a project to establish  the fluid and
              mineral mechanisms, fluid circulation pathways and  time scales responsible for
              the formation of authigenic minerals  formed at the Chile Triple Junction. 
              Hydrothermal pulses from the  buried ridge system have produced a series of
              mineral facies, which  will be analyzed with Li, B and O isotopes in addition
              to a range  of other analyses already accomplished.  A hydrogeochemical model 
              will be constructed using local tectonic and kinematic constraints,  in order
              to estimate fluid and geochemical fluxes associated with  ridge subduction.
