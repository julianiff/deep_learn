Abstract    :
                                                                  ABSTRACT    SBR 96-16330 
              PIs: Hyman & Lowe      The present project continues efforts to develop the
              Comparative  Bantu On-LineDictionary (CBOLD) which currently serves as a basis 
              for theoretical, descriptive, and historical research on this  important and
              vast language family. During the first three years  of the project,
              CBOLDcreated a unified database for comparative  research in Bantu based on
              lexical materials, including over two  dozen complete dictionaries, scores of
              smaller wordlists, and  other lexical databases.  Of the 500+ daughter
              languages in the  Bantu family, CBOLD now has representative data for over 120.
                CBOLD has become a major international collaboration and now  distributes
              (electronically and soon by other means) these  lexicographic materials to
              linguists, historians, other social  scientists and even epidemiologists
              throughout the world. In this  second three-year period, activities at CBOLD
              will center around  three essential activities: 1) Development of the
              etymological  (comparative) component of the database; 2) Continued analysis of
               linguistic phenomena as exemplified in the Bantu lexicon  (semantic,
              morphological, phonological); and 3) Completing the  inventory lexical material
              from throughout the Bantu zone. In  parallel with the CBOLD database
              development effort, resident and  visiting researchers at Berkeley, as well as
              scholars accessing  materials through our WEB site 
              (http://bantu.berkeley.edu/cbold.html) will continue to utilize  CBOLD to
              produce scholarly works in their respective fields.
