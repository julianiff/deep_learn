Abstract    :
              D'Youville College requests support from NSF to connect it's campus to the
              Internet.  D'Youville College is an independent liberal arts institution in
              Western New York with nearly 2000 graduate and undergraduate students.  The
              College intends to connect to the Internet through the NYSERNet, a local
              Internet service provider.  The campus needs the Internet connection to be able
              to access information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world.
               The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of this institution as
              well as the community in general.  The award provides partial support of the
              project for two years.
