              CISE/EHR/ENG/MPS Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies Program:  A
              Design Education Center:  Using Cognitive Science and Technology to Facilitate
              Learning and Doing Design    Georgia Tech has been awarded funding in the
              amount of $50,110 for a period of 12 months to initiate a planning effort to
              design a multi-institute, multi-disciplinary, collaborative center to design,
              develop and evaluate environments (both physical and virtual) for design
              education at all education levels;  to design, develop and evaluate curricula,
              curriculum guidelines, and classroom practices for learning and doing design. 
              The center will serve as a research center, a forum for issues in design
              education, a forum for teacher and faculty development, and an agent for
              pragmatic dissemination of the results of its research.    Partners in this
              planning grant include MIT, University of Colorado, University of California at
              Berkeley, University of Wisconsin, Addison-Wesley Interactive, Apple Computer,
              and Netscape.
