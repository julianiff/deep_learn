Abstract    :
              9616851  Prahl         Determining how much of the organic matter found in
              marine  sediments originates from marine primary production and how much  was
              transported from land is one of the major problems of modern  organic
              geochemistry. The question of terrestrial contribution to  deep-sea sediments
              impacts upon our understanding of the evolution  of the sedimentary record,
              including its usefulness in  understanding past, and future climatic trends in
              relation to the  global dynamics of carbon and carbon dioxide. To the extent
              that  transport from land to the deep ocean is aeolian, as is generally  the
              case for the transport of iron, there may even be links with  factors
              controlling oceanic primary production.         In this study the principal
              investigator will use plant wax  analysis and carbon-13 measurements to
              estimate the amounts of  terrestrial and oceanic carbon in sediment from
              several deep-ocean  sites. He will use the C-13 and wax chemistry of modern-day
              marine  plankton and terrestrial plant materials as end-members of a scale 
              along which analytical results for arbitrary sediments may be  placed. The
              approach will involved development and validation of  this method for
              characterizing the deep-sea sediment carbon pool.
