Abstract    :
              IRI-9616131  Nandhakumar, N.  University of Virginia  $49,996 - 12 mos    SGER: 
              Discovery Driven Manipulation of NonRigid Objects:  Representation, Sensing 
              and Planning    This award, in the SGER mode, funds an initial exploration of 
              machine discovery of motor coordination skills through sensory  input.  Recent
              psychophysical studies have revealed that humans  can discover proper motor
              coordination skills through sensory  input for tasks in which they have had no
              previous experience.  The PIs are currently developing a spatial Jacobian-based
               framework for the design of robotic, nonrigid object  manipulation strategies
              which emulate this human ability.  Unlike existing algorithms, the strategies
              derived using this  framework do not require the use of a priori deformation
              models  since the necessary object parameters are learned during the  process. 
                Since the spatial Jacobians of an object are spatially  dependent,the
              critical obstacle in the framework's continued  development is determining the
              amount of information which must  be recovered in the learning or discovery
              phase of the  algorithms for accurate reconfiguration.  For general flexible 
              objects, the spatial Jacobian sets will be quite large and not  efficiently
              learnable.  Thus, in this preliminary research we  will determine what subsets
              of spatial Jacobians must be  obtained by the process to move the object from
              an initial  state to a final state within an acceptable positional error.  An 
              experimental investigation will also determine the  possibility of creating a
              set of canonical shapes to reduce the  configuration space size as well.
