Abstract    :
                  Improving productivity and reliability of labor-intensive  high-performance
              software is an important scientific problem  with obvious economic
              ramifications.  This research is  testing the feasibility of a radically new
              compilation and  meta-compilation methodology to improve productivity and 
              reliability for high-performance algorithmic software in the  C programming
              language.  The research combines partial  evaluation for deeply-nested SETL
              data structures, data  structure and algorithm selection techniques, and 
              transformational techniques from relational query  optimization.  This is
              leading to a statically typed variant  of SETL from which it is expected
              large-scale C programs can  be generated at a high translation rate.***
