Abstract    :
              9616532  Madigan, David  Tanimoto, Steven    University of Washington    Use of
              On-Line Assessment in Forming and Coaching Learning Groups    University of
              Washington has been awarded a 3-year grant for $589,701 to develop experimental
              software tools and methodologies to support various on-line assessment
              activities in both the High School environment and the University environment. 
              Tools will be developed that combine assessment functions with facilities to
              translate results of assessment into meaningful interventions in both physical
              and virtual classrooms.  The facilities include means of visualizing assessment
              of information for individual students and groups, means for organizing groups
              of students for particular activities, electronic mail exchanges, and means to
              help teachers articulate pedagogical goals and progress within the contexts of
              these groups.  The project experimentation will focus in the subject area of
              probability and statistics with the aim of enhancing the productivity and
              effectiveness of teachers in guiding their student groups in mastering the
              subject matter using Internet-based group discussion.
