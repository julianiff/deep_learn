Abstract    :
              Jones, Thomas  96-16964    Dr. Jones will study the synchrotron radiation  which
              results from the relativistic plasmas  ejected from the nuclei of active
              galaxies and in  the presence of a magnetic field.  The research is  a combined
              program using  numerical simulations as  well as radio observations using
              interferometer  and single-dish mapping.  The simulations will  include the
              injection and transport of  relativistic electrons and will show the predicted 
              signatures of radio and x-ray emissions.  Then  very large radio galaxies will
              be observed with  multiple frequencies, producing the spectral  shapes for
              comparison with theory.  Combining the  theoretical and observational results
              should  provide a check on the current assumptions about  synchrotron sources.
