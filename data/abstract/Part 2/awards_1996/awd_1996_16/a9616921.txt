Abstract    :
                    This award is made under the high performance connections portion  of
              NCRI's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides
              partial support for an OC-3 ATM connection to the  Very High Performance
              Backbone Network Service (vBNS).    Applications include:  - Computational
              Astrophysics in conjunction with the National Center for                       
                 Supercomputer Applications and the Pittsburgh  Supercomputer Center.  -
              Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Millimeter Wavelength Astronomical    Array in
              conjunction with the University of California at    Berkeley and the University
              of Illinois.  - Space and Plasma Physics National Center for Supercomputer   
              Applications, the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center and the Jet    Propulsion
              Laboratory.  - Processing, Storage and Retrieval of Remote Sensing Imagery in  
               conjunction with the NASA EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, South    Dakota
              Cornell University and the San Diego Supercomputer Center.  - National Scalable
              Cluster Project in conjunction with the    University of Pennsylvania,
