Abstract    :
              This project support a China-US Bilateral Workshop on Seismic Codes to be held
              in China in December of 1996.  Approximately ten participants from the United
              States will attend, and their international travel costs are to be paid from
              the NSF grant for this project. The costs of the Workshop incurred within
              China, including lodging, meals, and local travel, are to be paid on the part
              of China, who are represented by two agencies: The Institute of Engineering
              Mechanics of the State Seismological Bureau and the Institute of Earthquake
              Engineering of the Academy of Building Research.    The subject of the Workshop
              extends to a future generation of seismic codes, rather than merely a
              comparison of existing seismic codes in China and the United States.  The
              American participants will be selected by a three-member Steering Committee, in
              consultation with the NSF project officer.  Participants will write papers to
              be included in a Proceedings of the Workshop.  A bilateral working group will
              develop recommendations for plenary session discussion at the Workshop, and the
              recommendations adopted will also be included in the Proceedings.  It is
              planned that selected key participants from other key countries will attend, as
              coordinated by the American and Chinese organizers; costs associated with those
              participants and arrangements for any papers they may write are beyond the
              scope of this proposal.  This is a project implemented under the US-China
              Protocol on Cooperative Earthquake Studies, Annex III.
