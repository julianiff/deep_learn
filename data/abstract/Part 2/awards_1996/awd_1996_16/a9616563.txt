              X-33, Planning Year    The Los Angeles Unified School District has been awarded
              funding in the amount of $50,000 for a period of 12 months for a planning grant
              to study the effect of access to technology on the education of a traditionally
              underrepresented, culturally and linguistically undeserved student/parent
              population.  The proposed research will lead to the formation of policy and
              curricular changes which will significantly affect education in urban,
              low-income communities into the twenty-first century.    The project will
              involve the collaboration of many different entities: K-12 teachers and
              administrators;  university researchers and professors; governmental
              organizations; and private business.  During this planning year, approximately
              15 specific collaboratively development projects will be tested for feasibility
              and eventual implementation.  Data and analyses gathered from these projects
              will be disseminated widely, using the full resources of the Internet and the
              World Wide Web.
