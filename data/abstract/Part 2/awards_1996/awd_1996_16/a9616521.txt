Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program provides support for research on the magnetic properties and  
              synthesis of transition metal carboxylate clusters by Dr. George Christou   of
              the Chemistry Department, Indiana University.  Some families of   manganese
              carboxylate clusters have been found to exhibit single-molecule   magnetism
              (SMM).  Research will determine the influence of the molecular   environment on
              the observed magnetic properties and the factors   responsible for SMM
              behavior.  Detailed studies will include both DC and   AC magnetic
              susceptibility measurements.  New examples of complexes   exhibiting SMM will
              be synthesized, including cobalt carboxylate   clusters.  In addition, metal
              carboxylate clusters will be incorporated   into supramolecular assemblies
              using a variety of polyfunctional ligands.    The resulting compounds will be
              tested for magnetic properties in an   attempt to provide synthetic access to
              new magnetic materials.  Some   molybdenum and rhenium species with alkoxide
              functionalities will also be   prepared.  Magnetic materials are
              technologically important in many areas, including   electronics and
              manufacturing.  Miniaturization and finer control of   devices continue to be
              desirable goals.  This research will lead to   better understanding of magnetic
              phenomena at the molecular level and   possibly to increased ability to design
              molecular- and nano- scale   devices with specific magnetic properties.
