Abstract    :
                      9616390  Malloy    The Benjamin Banneker Association, Inc. (BBA) seeks
              to organize a leadership conference.  This conference will enable the BBA to
              bring together mathematics educators and mathematicians from all sections of
              the country to identify issues and to generate solutions to meet the challenges
              associated with the teaching and learning of African-American children.    The
              main goal of this project is to improve the mathematics education and
              achievement of African-American students.  Specific goals of the leadership
              conference are as follows:  1.  to develop a cadre of people who are
              knowledgeable about the mathematics learning and teaching of African-American
              children and research in these areas;  2.  to inform participants of  policies
              that affect the mathematics education of African-American children;  3.  to
              develop guidelines that will assist leaders who will serve as catalysts for
              change in the mathematics learning of African-American children; and  4.  to
              inform organizations such as the National Science Foundation about issues
              related to the mathematics education of African-American children.
