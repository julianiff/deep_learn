Abstract    :
              The Organic Dynamics Program supports studies of photochemistry and   strained
              molecules carried out under the direction of Professor Richard   Johnson of the
              University of New Hampshire at Durham.  Through a   combination of experimental
              and calculational studies, Professor Johnson   explores the formation and
              reaction chemistry of high-energy organic   compounds with distorted multiple
              bonds, including small-ring 1,2-dienes   such as 1,2-cyclobutadiene and
              1,2-cyclopentadiene and 1,2,3-trienes such   as 1,2,3-cyclobutatriene and
              1,2,3-cyclohexatriene.  Other strained-ring   compounds, cyclopropanated
              phenanthrenes, serve as photochemical   precursors to vinylidene, vinylcarbene,
              cyclopropylidene, and other   carbenes.  Development of a fundamental
              understanding of chemical structure and   reactivity often requires the study
              of compounds designed to test   implicit and explicit assumptions about
              chemical bonding and stability.    Professor Richard Johnson, of the University
              of New Hampshire at Durham,   uses the energy of light to induce the formation
              of molecules designed to   stretch the limits of such assumptions, focusing on
              cyclic compounds for   which consideration of simple bonding principles would
              predict   impossibility of existence.  These studies, in addition to their  
              importance on the fundamental level, will lead to new routes for the  
              preparation of molecules with biological activity and for the preparation   of
              unusual polymeric materials, and may also shed light on phenomena   observed in
              combustion chemistry, fullerene (`Bucky ball`) synthesis, and  
              extraterrestrial chemistry.
