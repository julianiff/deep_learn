Abstract    :
              DMI-9616456  Lee   This research project is to improve a newly developed vacuum
              infusion resin transfer molding process through a fundamental study of resin
              flow, fiber wetting, and resin cure/shrinkage.  The research activities include
              analysis of micro-flow behavior in the vacuum bag infusion process, analysis of
              cure, shrinkage and chemorheology of styrene containing resins, process and
              material innovation, and comparison of quality of composites made by open mold
              and vacuum bag infusion molding processes. This collaborative research project
              addresses fundamental issues on the vacuum infusion resin transfer molding
              process.  The research project has a balance between theory and experiment, and
              will provide valuable findings for the reinforced composite industry.
