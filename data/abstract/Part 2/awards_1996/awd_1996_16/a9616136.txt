Abstract    :
              This research will address several key theoretical issues related to ~5kHz to
              ~5MHz frequency-range radio waves observed on the ground in the auroral zone. 
              First, the PI will incorporate proper models of the ionospheric plasma and
              low-density cavity into the study to understand how electromagnetic wave
              propagate in realistic models of cavity and ionospheric plasma.  Then, he will
              conduct a detailed parametric study of various physical attributes associated
              with energetic electrons, establishing a firm understanding of the general
              characteristics of direct emission theory.  Next, he will investigate the
              "indirect emission theory," based on the notion of electrostatic waves
              interacting among themselves inside the radiation source, thus converting to
              free space electromagnetic waves.  Finally, he will calculate various physical
              quantities associated with radio waves, including the wave intensity and
              spectral pattern that can be directly compared with experimentally observed
              quantities.  All of these tasks will enhance basic understanding of wave and
              particle processes in the auroral zones.
