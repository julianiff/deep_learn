Abstract    :
              Fluvial geochemistry of the Himalayan orogen and the Tibetan  Plateau will
              constrain three important issues in paleoenvironmental  geochemistry:    1.  
              The extent to which the uplift has accelerated aluminosilicate  weathering over
              pre-collision conditions.  such an acceleration has  recently been postulated
              to be the cause of a reverse greenhouse  effect responsible for the climatic
              deterioration of the last ~50  my.    2.   The generality of the enhanced flux
              of U observed in the  preliminary sampling of a few of the Himalayan streams
              and the  Ganges-Brahmaputra.  This flux appears to be between 10 and 15% of 
              the global total and could help account for the ~50% increase in  the U/Ca in
              foraminiferal calcite now in the process of being  developed.    3.   The
              origin and cause of the uniquely high fluxes of radiogenic  Sr observed in the
              rivers sampled to date.  This flux accounts for  the dramatic rise over the
              last ~40 my in the seawater 87Sr/86Sr  ratio as recorded in marine limestones. 
              If such a flux enhancement  is characteristic of Himalayan-style continental
              collisions then  the isotope curve must be regarded as a marker of specific
              geologic  events rather than a proxy for weathering rates in general as 
              assumed in current model simulations of paleo-pCO2.    A very extensive suite
              of samples has been collected from the  headwaters of the Indus in Northern
              Pakistan, the Indus and  Brahmaputra tributaries in Tibet and the headwaters of
              Ganges  tributaries in Nepal.  This sampling program is on-going.  These  will
              be analysed for the major species and for U, Sr, 87Sr/86Sr,  Rb, Cs and Ba. 
              This data suite will constrain the deconvolution of  the aluminosilicate versus
              limestone and evaporite contributions to  the flux and hence the magnitude of
              the net CO2 sink.  Coupled with  existing data and geological information it
              will help identify the  sources and causes of the elevated fluxes of U and
              radiogenic Sr.
