Abstract    :
                  Abstract  EEC-9616399  Watts    This award provides funding for a "TIE"
              grant involving three NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers: 
              the University of Washington's Center for Analytical Chemistry; New Jersey
              Institute of Technology's Center for Emission Reduction; and the University of
              Tennessee's Center for Measurement and Control.  The goal is to develop
              improved methods for the design and operation of batch chemical processes. 
              Such processes are becoming increasingly important as the U.S. chemical
              industry gears up for more new pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals.  The
              specific aims are:    Allow systematic synthesis of process flowsheets as
              sequences of operating steps in a way that minimizes or eliminates waste
              production.    Provide computer simulation tools for control/operability
              analysis of a given flowsheet.  This will allow detection of potential hazards
              and inefficiencies so they can be eliminated during the design phase rather
              than after the plant has been put into operation.    Develop process monitoring
              methods to allow fault detection and feedback control operating units.    The
              three centers will work cooperatively to advance the above goals, sharing
              software and information by electronic transfer over the Internet, and by other
              means.  Industrial sponsors of the Centers will also participate (in technical
              meetings) to ensure that the project activities are relevant to their needs.
