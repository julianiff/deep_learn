              Making Learning a Part of Life:  Theories, Technologies, Practices, and
              Assessment in Support of Lifelong Learning    The University of Colorado has
              been awarded funding in the amount of $50,000 for a period of 12 months to
              initiate a planning effort to establish a CRLT Center focused on the theme
              "making learning a part of life; theories technologies, practices, and
              assessment in support of self-directed life long learning."  The Center will
              build on funded research in computer science, cognitive science, psychology and
              education.  The University of Colorado and its extended community will function
              as a testbed for the development and evaluation of learning technology tools
              and approaches.  The planning grant will allow current research approaches to
              be shaped into specific activities that will comprise the collaborative project
              of the Center.    Partners in this planning grant include Apple Computer and
              Boulder Community Network.
