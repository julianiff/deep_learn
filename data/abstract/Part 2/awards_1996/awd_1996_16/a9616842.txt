Abstract    :
              Capitol College requests support from NSF to connect it's campus to the
              Internet.  Capitol College in Laurel, MD has approximately 1,200 students,
              faculty and staff.  The college intends to connect through BBN Planet, a local
              Internet service provider.  The campus needs the Internet connection to be able
              to access information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world.
               The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of this institution as
              well as the community in general.  The award provides partial support of the
              project for two years.
