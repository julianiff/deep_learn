Abstract    :
              This award supports a three year project to continue investigation of Internet
              web caching.  It is a follow-on to a successful two year project which deployed
              caching servers at the five NSF-funded supercomputing centers and at FIX-West. 
              The project resulted in considerable international participation and an early
              version of caching software called Squid which is now being used at over 400
              sites.  This follow-on project does the following:    ... encourage greater
              U.S. participation.  ... continue Squid code development and maintain the
              public domain code base for experimentation and collaboration.  ... hold at
              least one workshop to improve exchange of ideas among caching researchers.  ...
              standardize the Internet Caching Protocol (ICP) to assure interoperability
              between implementations.  ... develop an automatic cache discovery system.  ...
              assist in improving the web software, http, to support caching.  ...
              collaborate with other caching research groups to use multicast for
              distributing data between caches.  ... develop specifications for high
              performance caching hardware, and work with the vendors in developing such
              equipment.  ... investigate research questions such as scaling, recording
              system performance and information provider hit statistics, and improving
              statistics gathering to enable better caching simulations.
