Abstract    :
                This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to measure, archive  and
              distribute MPEG II video traffic from the 1996 Summer Olympics.  The  objective
              is to create a library of traffic signatures that can be used by  the research
              community.  Potential uses of this library are in 1) resource  management
              studies (e.g., scheduling and call-admission control), 2)  compression
              algorithms, and 3) video storage and retrieval performance.  The MPEG-II
              library will be supplemented with approximately two hours of  Graphics and
              Visualization traffic (slightly over one GByte) collected over  the Graphics,
              Visualization and Usability Center's network on their January  18, 1996
              demonstration day.  Together they should add to the networking  community's
              traffic database on emerging multi-media applications.    Recent traffic
              studies indicate that slowly-decaying auto-correlation  functions and
              heavy-tailed marginal densities in input traffic have a  significant impact on
              queue length statistics at a multiplexor.  Further,  variable bit-rate video
              applications have shown to exhibit slowly decaying  auto-correlation functions
              with Gamma/Pareto marginals.  Protocols and  systems need to exist in the
              environment and need to be built for this  environment.  Generating
              representative workloads is, therefore, an  important step towards effective
              resource management.
