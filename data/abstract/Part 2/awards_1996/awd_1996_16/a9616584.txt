Abstract    :
              9616584  Pea, Roy  SRI International    Center for the Integration of Learning
              Technologies    SRI International has been awarded a 1 year grant for $50,000
              to plan for a model center for collaborative research on learning technology. 
              This center will eventually address pressing issues in the integration of
              research and education, train postdoctoral scholars to work at the intersection
              of technology and instruction, support a community-wide dialogue about the
              future of educational technology, and develop or refine methodologies that
              enable this work.    Collaborative partners are SRI International, the
              University of California at Berkeley, and Vanderbilt University.  Teams will
              share research approaches and findings in detail, identify commonalties and
              differences in finding and approach, establish priorities, and commission
              activities.  During the planning year, the team concept will be tried out and
              evaluated with initial activation of one theme team.  Planning year activities
              include also the design of a system for continuous evaluation and refinement of
              CRLT activities, development of a plan for postdoctoral interdisciplinary
              research training, and the establishment of linkages to leverage the
              intellectual and financial contributions of other investigators and
              institutions, including university scientists, school systems, industry
              scientists and groups, think tanks, technology-based corporations and
              libraries.  The World Wide Web will be an integral part of the Center's
              communication and dissemination activities.
