Abstract    :
                Palm Beach Community College requests support from NSF to connect the main
              campus and three remote campuses to the Internet.  The College serves the
              greater Palm Beach County, Florida.  It has approximately 50,000 students
              enrolled in a wide range of academic programs which lead to associate degrees
              or to a transfer to a four year institution. The college will connect to the
              Internet through a local Internet  service provider to be selected
              competitively.  The campus needs the Internet connection to be able to access
              information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world.  The
              connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of this institution as well
              as the community in general.  The award provides partial support of the project
              for two years.
