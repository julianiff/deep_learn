Abstract    :
                  9616811  Gutowski     Observational studies have shown that the distribution
              of water vapor is highly structured relative to other meteorologically
              important fields and, as a consequence, may require special numerical treatment
              for accurate and efficient modeling.  This may be especially so for climate
              simulations there computational constraints limit the feasible resolution.  The
              principal investigators will apply continuous dynamic grid adaptation (CDGA)
              techniques to model the horizontal and vertical distribution of atmospheric
              water vapor.  Development will be done on a limited-area model which will allow
              for comparisons between model simulations of the water vapor fields and high
              resolution water-vapor soundings obtained during a recent field experiment
              called STORM-FEST.       Observational studies also suggest that the water
              vapor distribution is, at times, confined by isentropic surfaces.  The CDGA
              thus may produce an isentropic grid in regions where the water vapor field is
              isentropic (computationally simpler) and naturally will avoid an isentropic
              grid where the distribution is non-isentropic.  The PIs will explore the extent
              to which CDGA provides a smooth, dynamic means of exploiting isentropic
              behavior in the atmosphere without making a priori assumptions about where the
              transitions between isentropic and non-isentropic dynamics will occur.     This
              research will make an important contribution to the goals of the Role of
              Clouds, Energy, and Water in Global Climate Change Program.  ***
