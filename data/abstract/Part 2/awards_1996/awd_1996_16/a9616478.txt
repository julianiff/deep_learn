Abstract    :
              9616478  Fontana, Lynn  George Mason University    How Can an Information
              Environment Support Higher-Order Thinking Skills in Science Education?   
              George Mason University has been awarded a 1-year grant of $372,292 to examine
              how emerging information technologies can be integrated to create a learning
              environment that supports new approaches to science instruction at the college
              and secondary school levels.  Basic research will address how to integrate
              effectively knowledge about science instruction, higher-order skills
              acquisition, instructional design, intelligent assessment, and computer
              networks.  A student-centered, interdisciplinary, problem-centered and
              collaborative information environment to support teaching and learning will be
              built and field-tested.
