Abstract    :
                9616654    A request has been made for $3,000 to help offset the costs of page
              charges for a special issue of the IEEE Journal to be devoted to high pressure
              arcs and high frequency thermal plasmas and to appear in April 1997.  In
              particular this funding will help defray the publication costs for those
              potential contributors from the former Soviet Union (FSU) and in East European
              countries who are unable to come up with these page charges.  It is anticipated
              that papers from these leading scientists will make an important contribution
              to our knowledge and technological base in this field and will facilitate
              cooperation between scientists of the FSU and East European countries with
              scientists in the USA.
