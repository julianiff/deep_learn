Abstract    :
                    9616705  Liu  This award is for the partial support of 25 graduate
              students to  attend the 1997 Joint American Society of Mechanical Engineers 
              (ASME), American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), Society of  Engineering
              Science (SES) summer meeting which will be held at  Northwestern University on
              June 29-July 2, 1997.  This meeting  will provide a forum for the in depth
              discussion of detailed  questions in the research and education aspects of the
              mechanics  and materials area.  The conference will actually include a wide 
              range of disciplines with many interactions being likely.  It is  expected that
              700-800 scientists and engineers will attend.   Therefore the students will be
              able to learn from their peers and  leaders in their fields.  ***
