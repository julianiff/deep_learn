Abstract    :
                                            Proposal AST 96-16978  PI: Roberta Humphreys 
              Institution: University of Minnesota-Twin Cities      This award supports
              travel expenses for participants to a  workshop at U. MN on "Proper Motions and
              Galactic Astronomy".  About 50 participants are expected. All-sky surveys (e.g.
               Hipparchos) in progress provide new, large, highly accurate  databases. These
              will be particularly useful in selecting  candidates for brown dwarf and
              extrasolar planet searches, in  which there is a strong current interest. The
              new data also help  tie down the first step in the distance scale, on which 
              cosmological theories depend. For these reasons, this is a timely  workshop.
