Abstract    :
              9616468  Stebbins    This grant provides $31,100 as partial support of  the
              costs of upgrading the Department of  Geological and Environmental Sciences'
              nuclear  magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer, originally  purchased in 1987,
              with a super high speed, high  pulse, power magic-angle spinning (MAS) probe
              with  a low 27-Al background signal, an MAS spin rate  controller and an MAS
              rotor synchronization  system.  These upgrades will allow researchers at 
              Stanford to continue their cutting edge research  on the structure and dynamics
              of silicate glasses  and inorganic solids using in situ, high  temperature NMR
              spectroscopy. The PI is recognized  as one of the leading international
              researchers in  the field of molecular inorganic geochemistry  using NMR
              spectroscopy as a primary tool to  elucidate the atomic level structure of
              minerals  and glasses.  Recent developments in NMR  spectroscopy, namely,
              multiple-quantum magic-angle-  spinning (MQMAS) and satellite transition
              (SATRAS)  MAS NMR will now be possible at Stanford with  these upgrades and
              will allow unprecedented  characterization of quadrupolar nuclei in a much 
              wider range of inorganic solids.  ***
