Abstract    :
                    Abstract  EEC-9616808  Dogan    The Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for Design of Analog-Digital Integrated Circuits (CDADIC) is a
              multi-university consortia composed of Washington State University, University
              of Washington, Oregon State University and the State University of New York -
              Stoneybrook.  This planning award is funding an industry-university meeting to
              determine the economic viability of establishing a research site for CDADIC at
              Tuskegee University.    Establishing a research site at Tuskegee University
              will not only expand the CDADIC research agenda but it will provide an
              effective industry-university interaction mechanism for minority students.
