Abstract    :
                    9616818  Gray     The principal thrust of this research project is a
              broad-based  study of the basic structure, structure changes and dynamics of
              the inner core of hurricanes and typhoons.  In addition, the principal
              investigator, Dr. Gray, will explore improved methods for predicting cyclone
              intensity changes, processes affecting the strength and evolution of the outer
              region of tropical cyclones, and the relationship between the inner and outer
              regions of these storms. The research will employ a wide variety of
              observational data, from research aircraft observations to satellite and
              rawinsonde data, in the analyses.  This project can be separated into four
              major topics: (1)  the structure of the inner core, (2)  maximum potential
              intensity (MPI), (3)  cyclone intensity prediction, and (4) processes
              regulating outer core intensity and cyclone size.  The second topic is one of
              the most hotly contested areas in tropical cyclone research today.  Dr. Gray, a
              long time leader in this field, can be expected to make important contributions
              regarding the issues.      Tropical cyclones represent one of the most
              devastating types of severe weather phenomena.  Improved understanding of their
              evolution is key to better forecasts that would be of enormous benefit to
              society.    ***
