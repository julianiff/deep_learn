Abstract    :
                Stein, Robert  AST 96-16886    Drs. Stein and Hawley will model and develop
              diagnostics for  analyzing dynamic phenomena in the solar atmosphere.  Their 
              theoretical calculations will follow the detailed interaction of  the radiation
              and plasma motions in response to driving motions  and rapid energy injection
              both in  the presence and in the absence of magnetic fields.  The analysis  of
              line profiles, when compared  to observation, will constrain the dynamics of
              the photosphere,  chromosphere, and the transition  region and shed light on
              the types of motions found. They will  also model the behavior of these 
              regions of the atmosphere in response to energy injection during  flares and
              compare models with  observations.  ***
