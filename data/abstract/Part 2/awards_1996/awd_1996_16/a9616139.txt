Abstract    :
                    (A) This project focuses on the design and analysis of efficient 
              algorithms for network and combinatorial optimization problems.  In particular,
              the project concentrates on (1) theoretical  analysis and experimental
              evaluation of algorithms and (2)  algorithmic challenges that arise in
              applications such as  telecommunication networks and information management. 
              Specifically at AT\&T, development of new and enhanced  communication and
              information services necessitates algorithmic  research and formulation of new
              models and problems. (B) A  principal component of the project is the design of
              fast  algorithms for fundamental network problems (such as shortest  path flow
              computations, and transitive closure).   For large  problem instances where a
              quadratic time exact algorithm is  infeasible, approximate linear time
              algorithms are investigated,  by considering these well known problems in new
              contexts.  For  example, availability of multi-processor systems warrants 
              development of parallel and distributed algorithms, and large  interactive
              databases necessitate the design of dynamic and  online algorithms. (C) This
              award enables the PI to visit the  Department of Computer Science, University
              of California,  Berkeley for six months, so that fruitful collaborations with 
              faculty and graduate students can be initiated.  In particular,  her activities
              include (3) the development and teaching of a  graduate course in network
              algorithms and combinatorial  optimization, and (4) an outreach program to
              women and other  under represented groups.  It is anticipated that this 
              university/industrial collaborative effort will be continued at  both Berkeley
              and AT\&T Laboratories.***
