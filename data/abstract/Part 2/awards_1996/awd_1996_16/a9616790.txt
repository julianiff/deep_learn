Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of
              the Chemistry Division, Chan will use pressure as an experimental   parameter
              to elucidate the nature of dynamic processes, such as a   physical interaction
              or a chemical reaction, in the condensed phase.  A   diamond anvil cell (DAC)
              is used to introduce pressure at temperatures   down to 4 K, and systems are
              probed using emission lifetime, transient   absorption, and high-pressure laser
              spectroscopy.  Studies of quantum   tunneling reactions and experiments on
              energy transport in quasi   one-dimensional spectroscopic systems will be
              performed.  Pressure offers a useful new dimension in chemical investigation
              because   it provides a controlled and gradual means to modify molecular
              distance   and orientation.  In these experiments two diamond anvils compress a
                small hole in a gasket and generate very high pressure under conditions   of
              very low temperatures.   Results from this project will help   illuminate
              reactivity in the solid-state and will have practical   implications in
              understanding the photophysics of dye aggregates, such as   are important in
              the technology of photography.
