Abstract    :
              Schechter, Paul  AST 96-16866    Dr. Schechter will continue his study of
              gravitational  lenses in a three-part program.  The first is to continue  the
              reconnaissance of known and new quadruple lens systems.  The second is to
              conduct intensive monitoring of  PG1115+080, a gravitational lens for which
              multiple time  delays have been measured.  The third is to develop  algorithms
              and reduction methods to reduce the uncertainty  of the measurements as close
              as possible to the photon  limit.
