Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to produce a book-length examination of the early
              agricultural context  of genetic research in the United States, and of the
              significance of that context for the  development of genetics as a discipline. 
              The aim is to produce both a study of U.S. genetics in  its first thirty years
              and a case study of the relationship between institutional context and 
              intellectual content.  More specifically, the study will document the
              prevalence of Mendelian  genetics in agricultural institutions, explain that
              involvement in terms of U.S. agricultural  policy and characteristics of those
              institutions, and examine the implications for genetics  research of the
              practical and theoretical emphases of agriculture.  The central purpose of the
              study is to demonstrate that U.S. genetics, in its early decades  was an
              agricultural discipline, and that during this period its successes and failures
              were  consequences of agricultural policy and science that also went on to
              shape policy and science.  When completed, this study will be the first
              disciplinary history of genetics focusing exclusively  on the early decades
              within the United States.
