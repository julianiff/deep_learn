Abstract    :
              9616728  Arritt        The summertime Great Plains low-level jet is phenomenon
              known to be  associated with severe weather events.  Better understanding of
              the low-level jet  could lead to better forecasts of severe weather within the
              Great Plains.        The Principal Investigator will use a combination of
              numerical modeling and   observational analysis to quantify the relative
              contributions of boundary-layer  processes and synoptic dynamical forcing in
              the formation of the Great Plains low-  level jet.  The effect of divergence
              induced by the low-level jet on mesoscale rainfall  systems also will be
              investigated.  The project will use data from recently  implemented observing
              systems and will adopt new strategies for isolating the  contributions of the
              various processes that lead to the low-level jet.  Emphasis will  be given to
              the examination of physical processes that have been indicated in  previous
              modeling studies as important for the low-level jet and its subsequent  effects
              on mesoscale precipitation systems, but have not yet been confirmed by 
              observations.  Accomplishment of the research will provide improvements in our 
              understanding of the fundamental issues in the dynamics of the low-level jet,
              and  will support improvements in the prediction of nocturnal rainfall in the
              Great Plains   region.    ***
