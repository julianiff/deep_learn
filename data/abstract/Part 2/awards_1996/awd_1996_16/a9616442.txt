Abstract    :
              One focus of this research is a mechanistic study to determine if a   complex
              forms that delivers interhalogens to alkenes when xenon   difluoride, amine.HF
              reagents of boron trifluoride serve as the source of   fluorine.  In a second
              part of the research, the ionic and/or ion-radical   addition reactions of
              perfluoroalkenes will be probed.  In both   instances, undergraduates will form
              a major part of the research team.    With this renewal Research in
              Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the   Organic Dynamics Program supports
              the research of Dr. Dale F. Shellhamer   of the Department of Chemistry at
              Point Loma Nazarene College.  Professor    Shellhamer will focus his work on
              the study of the mechanism of organic   reactions.  Studying the generation of
              interhalogen fluorides and the   ionic reactions of perfluoroalkenes provides
              an excellent venue for the   training of undergraduate chemists.
