Abstract    :
              The aim of this planning project is to assemble a collection of non-human
              primate skulls from animals of known life history.  At the end of the planning
              period a sub-sample will be selected from this collection and used in a project
              examining the relationship between defects in non-human primate teeth and life
              events. The ultimate aim of this is to develop a method to recreate events in
              the lives of fossil humans.  The select sub-sample will provide the best
              possible experimental sample for an adequate test of whether life history
              events do reliably leave indicators in the developing hard tissues of the
              teeth.  It is essential to limit the final number of animals represented for
              practical reasons due to the time consuming nature of the analysis.  The
              estimated sample to be gathered is 100, of  which 50-60 would form the select
              sub-sample.  The primary source of primate carcasses is the New Iberia Research
              Center in New Iberia, Louisiana.  The carcasses will represent natural
              casualties from their non-human primate breeding program.  The other source of
              primate carcasses is a collection of 52 frozen laboratory and zoo animals from
              the University of Cambridge in England.
