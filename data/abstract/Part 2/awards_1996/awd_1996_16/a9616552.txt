Abstract    :
                This project is designed to investigate the social and ecological correlates
              of mating patterns and intergroup relationships in black-mantle tamarins,
              Saguinus nigricollis, in the lowland rainforest of eastern Ecuador.  These
              small New World monkeys appear to be more monogamous than other tamarin species
              and, therefore, offer an excellent opportunity to test the hypothesis that
              variability in mating patterns is related to the costs of infant-rearing and
              the importance of cooperative breeding in tamarins.  The study will use
              detailed behavioral observation of several populations to examine the
              ecological, reproductive, and social correlates of monogamy in black-mantled
              tamarins.  In addition to its unusual mating patterns, this species is also
              distinguished by the fact that intergroup relationships are non-aggressive and
              neighboring groups may form polygroup associations.  As a result, this species
              offers an opportunity to test the hypothesis that food competition between
              groups determines intergroup relationships, as well as hypotheses about the
              proximate causes, adaptive benefits, and social consequences of intergroup
              tolerance.  This study will contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary
              and proximate relationships between cooperative breeding and mating patterns in
              New World monkeys and other cooperative breeding species.
