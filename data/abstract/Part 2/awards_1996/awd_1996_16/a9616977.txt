Abstract    :
              9616977  Crowley    This project will continue previous studies using the
              Hamburg ocean  circulation model and an atmospheric energy balance model to
              assess  the effects of changes in physiography upon ocean circulation and  the
              sediment record. A sedimentation model, incorporating calcite,  opal, organic
              matter, PO4 and carbon isotopes will be used for the  latter component. The
              project will concentrate upon two topics (1)  gradual uplift of the
              Greenland-Faroe Ridge and its effect upon  North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW),
              and (2) controls upon NADW  production during the warm phase of the middle
              Pliocene, to be  assessed with varying winds, precipitation/evaporation
              balance, and  the effect of a warmer Southern Ocean.
