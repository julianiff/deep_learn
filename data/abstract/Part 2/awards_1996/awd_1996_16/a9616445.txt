              CISE/EHR/ENG/MPS Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies Program: 
              National Center for Collaborative Research    The University of Illinois, has
              been awarded $50,000 for a 12 month period to develop the rationale and plan
              for establishing a virtual National Center for Collaborative Research (NCCR) on
              Learning Technologies.  The proposed NCCR will perform multi-disciplinary
              research and development in learning technologies.  The activities of the
              proposed center will be directed toward developing and evaluating web-based
              learning technologies for application domains in which the community of
              learners is relatively heterogeneous.  These application domains include
              learning in K-12 and College environments, learning for industrial
              competitiveness, and learning  for health care and social services.    Partners
              in this planning grant include BBN, University of Arizona, Southern Illinois
              University, and the University of Southern California.
