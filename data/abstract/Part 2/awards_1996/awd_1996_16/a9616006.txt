Abstract    :
              9616006  Bourret    Technical   All living cells contain elaborate information
              processing systems that continuously monitor important parameters in their
              external environment and implement an appropriate response to changing
              conditions.  Complete analysis of the complicated networks of interconnected
              chemical reactions that make up signaling circuits will likely require detailed
              computer simulations.  This investigator has set up a computer model (BCT) of
              bacteria chemotaxis, and proposes here to evaluate and improve this model. 
              Some important parameters will be measured to replace some assumptions in the
              current model, and the accuracy of the simulation will be tested by comparing
              computer generated predictions with experimental measurements.  Any
              discrepancies will indicate areas which need further study.  The adaptive
              response will be incorporated into a new version of the BCT.  This research
              will improve our understanding of information processing in bacteria, and will
              provide the scientific community with a model to formulate simulations of
              signaling circuits.    Non-technical  This proposal is to improve and
              experimentally evaluate a computer model of chemotaxis in bacteria.  Models of
              this nature will be valuable in understanding signaling networks in biological
              systems.  ***
