Abstract    :
              9616630  Li    This grant supports the research of Professor H. Li to work on
              various problems in the theory of vertex operators. He wishes to show that
              certain holomorphic vertex operators of degree 24  exist, to work on the
              rationality of some W-algebras and to establish an equivalent functor from the
              category of vertex algebras and the category of Poisson Lie algebras.     This
              is research that starts out in the field of algebra but moves beyond that to
              touch both number theory and theoretical physics.  The reasons for these
              connections are that algebra can be though of as the study of symmetry in the
              abstract. As such algebra has direct applications to areas of physics and
              chemistry. In particular the modern theory of gauge fields in physics uses this
              area of algebra extensively and this project will study some of these
              connections at length. There are also connections to coding theory and the
              transmission of data across communication lines.
