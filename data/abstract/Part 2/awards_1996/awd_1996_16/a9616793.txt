Abstract    :
              9616793  Spilhaus  Support will be provided for regional global change research
              planning activities of interest to scientists in Asia, the Pacific and Africa
              and to U.S. scientists.  These activities include scientific workshops and
              planning meetings on development of: a regional climate system model and
              forecasting applications network for Asia; a research agenda on variability in
              land use/land cover change and its relation to global change in Asia and
              Africa; an agenda for research on interaction between global change and human
              health, water sources, and agriculture in Africa; and an agenda for research on
              land-ocean interactions in African coastal zones, particularly chemical fluxes
              in continental shelf regions.  These activities will be organized by the Global
              Change SysTem for Analysis, Research and Training (START) in conjunction with
              the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) and the European
              Network for Research in Global Change (ENRICH).  These activities are intended
              to also lead to standardization of data collection and analysis; integrated
              databases; and exchange of global change data and information.  ***      ??
