Abstract    :
              This dissertation project examines the development of Argentine criminology in
              the years 1890-1930.  It explores how this new discipline, which at the turn of
              the century included legal medicine, psychiatry, neurology, anthropology, and
              sociology, played a critical role in political debates on immigration, class
              formation, and national identity.  It argues that these criminologists helped
              to delineate the boundaries of citizenship and nationhood in a rapidly
              modernizing society rife with true and imagined social problems.  Argentine
              criminologists, many of whom were trained in Europe, sought to become vital
              players in  the international scientific community.  At the same time, they
              were engaged in a conscious project to build a distinctly Argentine science
              geared to solving Argentine social problems.  The project documents how the
              Argentine political and intellectual elite used the language and scientific
              concepts of criminology to articulate their fears of social unrest, political
              chaos, and property loss.  Moreover, it demonstrates how, as criminologists
              sketched new definitions of the criminal and proposed new criminal types, they
              as importantly constructed new ideals of the good Argentine citizen.  The
              project first traces the intellectual formation of criminology as a discipline,
              its institutionalization, and its rise to international status.  Second, the
              project describes the impact and realization of new criminological ideas in
              government policies, specifically in policy techniques, courtroom procedure,
              and legislative decisions.  Finally, it concludes with a discussion of the
              impact of criminological concepts on the increasingly narrow requirements for
              Argentine citizenship in the first decades of the twentieth century.
