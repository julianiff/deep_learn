Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    The effect of persistent synthetic organic contaminants (SOCs) on 
              the Antarctic ecosystems is poorly understood.  Dissolved organic  compounds
              (DOM) are ubiquitous to all surface waters in  Antarctica and these substances
              may play an important role in the  fate of SOCs.  DOM is capable of acting as a
              quasi-sorbent,  thereby altering the speciation of SOCs in the water column. 
              DOM  is also highly photoreactive and is able to form chemical  transients that
              can transform SOCs.  This dual-role nature of DOM  could have pronounced
              effects on the bioavailability of SOCs to  aquatic organisms.  This exploratory
              research will study  processes that control the fate of SOCs in the presence of
              DOM  from two small lakes on Ross Island.  Bioaccumulation experiments  using
              phytoplankton and cyanobacteria from these sites will be  conducted in an
              effort to understand the effect of DOM on the  bioavailability of SOCs. A
              chlorinated biphenyl congener and  pyrene have been selected for study because
              they represent  classes of contaminants found in Antarctica and they possess a 
              wide range of physiochemical properties.  Photolysis experiments  using
              artificial sunlight simulators will be studied to determine  the role of DOM as
              photocatalysts in the transformation of the  two target analytes.   The results
              from this exploratory research  will provide the groundwork for a much larger
              field project that  will study these processes both in situ and ex situ using
              other  SOCs.
