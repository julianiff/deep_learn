Abstract    :
                    This award is made under the high performance connections portion of
              NCRI's  "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides
              partial  support for two years for a DS-3 connection to the Very High
              Performance  Backbone Network Service (vBNS).  Applications include scalable
              extended  computing environments, remote sensing data analysis, brain mapping, 
              automatic target recognition, numerical simulation of nematic liquid  crystals,
              digital cardiography, teleconferencing technology, and virtual  reality user
              interfaces.  Collaborating institutions include Cornell Theory  Center,
              Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center, several NASA facilities, Naval  Research
              Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, University of  North Carolina
              and University of Utah.
