Abstract    :
                   The majority of species of animals have tightly regulated  intrinsic
              reproductive cycles that are governed by such things as  the time of the year
              or the availability of food.  However, in some  species reproductive function
              is governed by non-verbal physical  cues, such as chemical attractants or
              pheromones.  These chemicals  provide information about the reproductive status
              of potential  mates and may trigger reproductive cyclicity in some species. 
              Dr.  John Harder is investigating the reproductive, hormonal and 
              neurobiological consequences of pheromone exposure in a model  system
              completely dependent on chemical signaling.  These exciting  investigations
              will advance comparative reproductive biology and  provide a unique model for
              the study of chemical activation on  neuronal substrates.  In addition, these
              investigations will have  a significant impact on our understanding of the
              diversity of  reproductive strategies used in wild animals and may facilitate
              the  application of that understanding to the preservation of species in  the
              wild and in captivity.
