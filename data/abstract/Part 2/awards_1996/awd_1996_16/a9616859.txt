Abstract    :
              SRS 9616859  Vonortas  This research project aims to develop a database on
              European  research joint ventures (RJVs) and conduct empirical  analysis on
              issues such as the incentives of firms to form  RJVs, the impact of RJVs on the
              overall expenditures and  profitability of member firms.  RJVs are one of the 
              arrangements whereby firms join forces to undertake research  and development
              of common interest.  These arrangements have  become increasingly common and
              important for the competitive  strategies of firms in high technology
              industries.  This  database will be complementary and comparable to a database 
              currently in progress on U. S. firms and will enable  analysis of  possible
              differences between U. S-based  research joint ventures and those that are
              European based.  This database also will provide additional opportunity to 
              empirically test theoretical economics and business  literature on RJVs.  ***
