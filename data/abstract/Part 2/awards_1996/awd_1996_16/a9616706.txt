Abstract    :
              9616706  Lavenberg  The Los Angeles County Museum (LACM) houses collections of
              extant species of all major groups of vertebrates.  Among these, the birds and
              mammals have been computerized but the fishes, amphibians and reptiles have
              not.  This project will capture electronically the label data for 143,000
              specimen-lots of amphibians and reptiles and 235,000 specimen-lots of fishes. 
              In addition, the LACM will database the collections of frozen tissues,
              skeletonized preparations, radiographs, and the like that are associated with
              these collections. This computerization effort will facilitate the scientific
              use of the resource by making the collections information available on the WWW.
               More importantly, however, the information about the biodiversity of these
              organisms in the geographic regions represented by the holdings of the LACM
              will be available for use by land and resource managers and other
              decision-makers, as well as in education. The estimated cost per specimen for
              this work is $0.92. The Reseach Collections in Systematics and Ecology Program
              of the NSF is providing $0.53 per specimen (58%). In partnership with the NSF
              on this project, the LACM is providing the remainder.
