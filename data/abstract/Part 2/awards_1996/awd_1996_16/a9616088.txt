Abstract    :
              96-16088  Lipps  This proposal for a small SGER is within the guidelines for
              these awards because it is a novel idea that will serve the collections
              community and ventures into the application of new technology to a
              long-standing problem in that community.  The product of this award, a Web
              interactive, community-data-entry database that also can be queried
              interactively on the Web, will push the collections community toward more
              interaction among museums and researchers.  If a sufficient portion of the
              community does take advantage of the product of this award, it will contribute
              to a more scientific approach to the adoption of orphan collections and the
              location of scientific specimens that are available for study and curation. 
              The product itself will appear quickly, as many lines of computer code can be
              adapted from other collections-based database applications and tailored
              specifically to the problem at hand.  The new application, developed initially
              for invertebrate paleontology collections, will be made available for
              adaptation and adoption by other sites, in addition to the service that will be
              provided to the community by the PI's institution.
