Abstract    :
              This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of NCRI's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers K-12
              education institutions (including vocational technical schools), public
              libraries and museums.  It provides partial support for two years to connect an
              elementary school to a high school using wireless techniques.  The high school
              is already connected to the Internet over a telephone line.
