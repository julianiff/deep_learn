Abstract    :
                Abstract  9616404  de Zafra  Chlorine monoxide (ClO) is a product of the
              destruction of stratospheric ozone by chlorine, which is present in the
              stratosphere as a result of the breakdown of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).  ClO,
              as well as other trace stratospheric gases which are important in the Antarctic
              ozone hole, can be measured from the ground by microwave receivers, similar to
              those used in radio astronomy.  This project will continue a decade long series
              of such measurements in order to extend the climatology, but more importantly,
              to also provide a cross calibration of a new Network for the Detection of
              Stratospheric Change (NDSC) ClO microwave instrument which has recently been
              installed nearby at New Zealand's Scott Base.  The NDSC instruments are being
              installed at a number of sites world-wide as part of a joint NASA/WMO/UNEP
              program and it is quite important to provide as much correlative information as
              possible so that the NDSC can be relied upon in the future to monitor the
              health of the stratosphere.  ***
