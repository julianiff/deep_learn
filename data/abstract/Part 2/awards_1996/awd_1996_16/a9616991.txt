Abstract    :
              9616991  Cole, Ronald   Whitney, Gail  Oregon Graduate Institute of Science &
              Technology    Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies: 
              Conceptualization of a Flagship Center for Collaborative Research in Learning
              and Human Language Technologies    The Oregon Graduate Institute has been
              awarded funding in the amount of $50,000 for a period of 06 months to plan a
              NSF Flagship Center for Collaborative Research on Learning and Human Language
              Technologies.  The mission of the proposed Center is to support basic research
              on the use of human language technology to create better tools and strategies
              for learning.  Areas of research and tool development will include using speech
              as an input modality in computer assisted learning;  speech training for second
              language learning or articulation training; speech as a primary input modality
              for physically challenged individuals;  and speech as a context for learning
              about other things.
