Abstract    :
              9616775 Murthy  The purpose of this grant is to perform an evaluation of Russian
              research on the exploitation of electromagnetic (EM) effects I hypersonic
              flight.  There are many possible approaches to the use of EM to boost the
              potential speed and efficiency of hypersonic aircraft, and may possibilities
              for following research involving plasmas, EM, computational engineering,
              intelligent control, new materials and so on.  The major goal of this work is
              to see what the Russian research really tells us about the nature and 
              viability of  such possibilities. ***
