              Incorporating Computers and Group Work to Develop Effective and Efficient
              Learning Experiences    Georgia State University has been awarded funding in
              the amount of $50,000 for a period of 12 months to initiate a planning effort
              leading to the creation of a collaborative research program to investigate the
              effects of using an innovative instructional approach, called ACE Teaching
              Cycle, on the learning of undergraduate mathematics in relatively large size
              classes.  The ACE Teaching Cycle is based on a cognitive theory of learning and
              integrates activities of students: writing, writing computer programs and using
              the programs to represent mathematical concepts, investigating mathematical
              phenomena using computer tools (both constructed by the student and provided in
              the form of software packages), and students working in cooperative groups.
