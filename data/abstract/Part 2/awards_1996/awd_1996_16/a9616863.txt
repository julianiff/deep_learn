Abstract    :
              Thuan, Trinh Xuan  96-16863    Dr. Thuan will continue a collaboration with 
              scientists from Unkraine and Russia to study  nearby galaxies which are
              extremely metal-  deficient blue compact galaxies.  The first  research goal is
              to obtain a high precision  measure of the primordial helium abundance for a 
              sample of candidate blue compact galaxies.  The  primordial He abundance
              constitutes one of the  most promising ways to constrain the standard Big  Bang
              nucleosynthesis theory and the chemical  evolution models of blue compact dwarf
              galaxies.  The second goal is to study the extended HI  envelopes around young
              blue compact galaxies.  These are good candidates for being primordial  neutral
              hydrogen intergalactic clouds, which will  be studied to help understand why
              star formation  has been stunted for so long in these envelopes.
