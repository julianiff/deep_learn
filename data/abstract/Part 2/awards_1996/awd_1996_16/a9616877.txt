Abstract    :
                Lawson State Community College requested support from NSF to  connect it's
              campus to the Internet.  Lawson State Community  College is one of the twenty
              community colleges in the State of  Alabama and the only predominantly black
              supported state colleges  in Central Alabama.  It is located in the
              southwestern section of  Birmingham, Alabama and serves a student body of over
              2000.  Lawson State Community College intends to connect through the  Alabama
              Super Computer Authority.  The campus needs the Internet  connection to be able
              to access information resources throughout  the state, the nation and the
              world.  The connection will benefit  the faculty, staff students of this
              institution as well as the  community in general.  The award provides partial
              support of the  project for two years.
