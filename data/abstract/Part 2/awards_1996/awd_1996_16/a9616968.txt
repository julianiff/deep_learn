Abstract    :
              Brainerd, Tereasa  AST 96-16968    Dr. Brainerd will investigate the formation
              of rich  clusters of galaxies using high resolution numerical  simulations.  A
              nested grid code will be used to follow the  evolution of rich clusters.  The
              infall history of the  richest clusters in popular hierarchical models will be 
              determined and the physical properties of the clusters will  be compared to
              available observational results to assess  the viability of the models to
              reproduce observed clusters.  The numerical clusters will constitute a database
              of high  resolution test clusters for investigating effects such as 
              gravitational lenses for a population of distant source  galaxies.
