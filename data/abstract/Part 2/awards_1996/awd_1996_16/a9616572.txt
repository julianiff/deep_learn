Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop fast mapping tools and architectures for
               logic emulations that can greatly reduce the mapping time, and thus improve
              the  usefulness of logic emulation, and the speed of logic simulation.  Being 
              developed are: 1) technology mapping tools that integrate decomposition and 
              covering, and 2) placement tools that use partitioning methods to do higher- 
              quality global placement.  These are designed to improve both the mapping times
               and resulting quality for FPGA-based implementations.  Routing complexity 
              estimators are also being developed to guide algorithm choice.  These exploit
              the  mapping time-quality tradeoffs in many techniques.  Also being
              investigated are  new FPGA architectures for logic emulators, and systems that
              can support much  faster mapping times, yet still achieve high quality results.
               These steps are  being integrated into a complete mapping-time oriented tool
              suite for logic  emulation which exploits the mapping time/quality tradeoff in
              these systems.
