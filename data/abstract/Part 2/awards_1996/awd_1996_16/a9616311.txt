Abstract    :
              9616311  Pilkey   It is proposed to conduct immediately a sidescan-sonar,
              bathymetric, and diver-vibracore survey of the shoreface and inner continental
              shelf off Wrightsville Beach and Topsail Island, North Carolina.  The eye of
              hurricane Bertha made landfall this location on 12 July.  The week prior to the
              storm, an extensive sidecan-conar, seismic and bathymetric survey off Topsail
              Island was conducted as par of a regularly scheduled research cruise.  Over the
              past six years, we have also developed a comprehensive database of
              sidecan-conar, seismic, vibracore data, as well as wave and current
              measurements on the shoreface and inner shelf off Wrightsville Beach for the
              ongoing studies of the geologic framework and mobility of the shoreface
              sediment cover.   This situation furnishes a unique and unprecedented
              opportunity to examine in detail the impact (or lack thereof) of a major storm
              event on a well-studied barrier island shoreface.  Immediate documentation of
              this event is critical; post-storm processes may quickly modify or erase the
              storm signature.  This rapid-response survey will provide insight into the
              nature and importance of large-magnitude, short-term events in the longer-term
              (years to decades) evolution of the shoreface.
