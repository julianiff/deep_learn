Abstract    :
              9616417  Wurman        The Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes
              Experiment  (VORTEX) was held in the Central U.S. during Springs of 1994 and
              1995.  The  objectives of VORTEX were to further our understanding of
              tornadogenesis, tornado  dynamics, storm environment relationships, and
              numerical prediction of severe  tornadic storms.  Data was collected from a
              variety of sensors including aircraft,  ground based surface stations and upper
              air sites, and radars.  Several of these  sensors were stationary, but many
              were mobile, thus the scientists were able to  intercept and follow a large
              number of tornadic storms.          Data collected from a mobile 3-cm Doppler
              radar and video during the  VORTEX and during a smaller scale data collection
              effort during 1996 will be used  by the Ppincipal Investigator to study the
              detailed structure of tornado vortices.  The  radar data were obtained with
              unprecedented resolution at distances ranging from 2  to 12 km for eight
              separate tornadoes.  Two of the radar data sets were of very large  tornadoes
              at a ranges of about 3 km with resolution volumes of 60 x 60 x 75 m.   One of
              the data sets is of a large but relatively mild tornado at 30 x 30 x 75 m 
              resolution.  These radar data sets along with extensive video and photographic 
              footage will be used to document detailed tornado structures and evolution as 
              depicted from radar reflectivity, Doppler winds, and photogrammetry.   ***
