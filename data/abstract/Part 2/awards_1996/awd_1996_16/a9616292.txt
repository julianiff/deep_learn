Abstract    :
              This starter grant award to Arizona State University supports the   research of
              Professor Karl S. Booksh.  The research addresses a   multivariate optical
              methodology for quantitation employing a scanning   acousto-optic tunable
              filter.  The method optically constructs and   integrates a multivariate
              regression vector with the filter. Thus,   quantitation requires accessing a
              single channel detector only twice,   eliminating the need for an expensive
              multichannel detector and   minimizing the effect of read and thermal noise on
              quantitation.  Initial   applications of the methodology are quantitation of
              benzene homologues in   natural waters by fluorescence spectroscopy and
              quantitation of xylene   isomers in benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene
              mixtures.  The research is an advance in instrument design and data analysis  
              bringing new power to the field of optical measurements for chemical  
              analysis.  Many applications are possible, particularly in petrochemical  
              analysis.
