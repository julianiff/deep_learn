Abstract    :
              July 10, 19971aSerabyn/Abstract  ATM-9616766           Accurately calibrated
              measurements of atmospheric opacity  across the near-millimeter and
              submilimeter wavebands (3 - 0.3mm)  are proposed.  The measurements will be
              carried out using a Fourier  transform spectrometer at the Caltech
              Submillimeter Observatory on  the summit of Mauna Kea.  The broadband natrue of
              the spectrometer  will enable measurements covering up to a decade in
              frequency,  while the high altitude site will provide access to extremely dry 
              atmospheric conditions, allowing through-atmosphere observations at 
              frequencies well above those possible from seal level.  The goal of  this
              project is to relate the measure braodvand atmospheric opacity  curves to the
              atmospheric water vapor content, in order to address  issues such as the
              collisionally broadened lineshape of the H2O  molecule, the "quasi-continuum"
              H2O opacity contribution far from  resonance, and ultimately, the dry-air
              contribution to the  continuum opacity.  A better understanding of the H2O
              collisionally  broadened lineshape is important not only as a discriminator of 
              collisional lineshape models, but also because of the significant  impact water
              vapor opacity has on radiative transfer and energy  balance in our atmosphere,
              and on the propagation of radiation in  remote sensing and communications
              applications.
