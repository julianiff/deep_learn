Abstract    :
              9616241  Hammond    Trace element distributions in seawater and in the sediment
              record  are often used as proxies for both modern and paleooceanographic 
              conditions or processes.  However, before their full potential can  be
              realized, the behavior of these elements after deposition and  shallow burial
              on the seafloor must be clarified. In this study,  researchers at Oregon State
              University and the University of  Southern California will study the
              geochemistry of two potential  paleoindicator elements, barium and germanium,
              in the hard parts of  planktonic marine organisms deposited in sediments
              collected from  several oceanic regions. Specifically they will evaluate the
              common  assumptions that Ge is not fractionated from deposited siliceous 
              frustules and that the Ba:Alkalinity relation in seawater is  related to a
              coupled stoichiometry between organic carbon  decomposition, dissolution of
              barium, and dissolution of calcium  carbonate. The results are expected to
              better define the advantages  and limitations of these elements as tools for
              paleooceanographic  reconstructions.
