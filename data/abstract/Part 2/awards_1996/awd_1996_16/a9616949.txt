Abstract    :
              Helfrich  9616949  Laboratory experiments and numerical studies of planetary- 
              scale flow in multiply  connected domains will be conducted to examine
              circulation  features (e.g. recirculation  zones, zonal jets and flow
              separation)  that are induced by  islands and to explore the  validity of the
              linear Island Rule developed by Godfrey. The  experimental work will  begin
              with an examination of flow in the barotropic lid-  driven sliced cylinder
              analogue of  the beta plane. A number of island geometries will be  examined
              and the effects of  stratification will be added. A companion numerical study 
              using the Miami Isopycnic  coordinate model (MICOM) will be undertaken for
              comparison  with the experiments.
