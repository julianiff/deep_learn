              MINNESOTA-TWIN CITIES    Researchers will examine the role of climate forcing
              and landscape character on the evolution of vegetation cover and soil carbon
              storage in the central Arctic foothills of Alaska. A combination of field
              methods, modeling and paleoreconstruction will be used to determine the spatial
              variation of ecosystem processes on different age landscapes.  The results of
              this study will provide an indication of expected changes to the carbon balance
              in the arctic due to changes in tundra ecology as a result of global climate
              change.  The study is important for understanding the role of tundra as a
              source or reservoir of terrestrial carbon that may be added to or extracted
              from the atmosphere under proposed greenhouse climate conditions.
