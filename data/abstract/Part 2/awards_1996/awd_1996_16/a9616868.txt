Abstract    :
              9616868  Schafrik    The National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council,
               through its National Materials Advisory Board (NMAB) of the  Commission on
              Engineering and Technical Systems (CETS), is  conducting a study to determine
              methods for improving the  exchange of information between the materials
              science and  engineering community and the producers, users, and  disposers of
              materials.  The goal is to accelerate the  application of new materials and
              processing innovations.  The NMAB developed this project as result of a
              strategic  planning session at the September 1995 board meeting, and it  was
              approved by the NRC Governing Board Executive Committee  at its meeting on
              April 9, 1996.  The board considers this  effort to be an important step
              towards unifying the field of  materials science and engineering (MSE) by
              improving its  ties to the user communities so that MSE can provide  realistic
              choices that solve problems with the applications  of the materials.  The study
              is conducted as a joint program  between the NMAB and the Board on
              Manufacturing and  Engineering Design (BMAED).  The staffs of these two boards 
              are a representative cross-section of the materials and  manufacturing
              communities in industry and academe.  %%%  It is expected that successful
              completion of this study will  lead to improved selection of materials in
              future  engineeering systems through enhanced communication between  the
              materials specialists and user communities.  ***
