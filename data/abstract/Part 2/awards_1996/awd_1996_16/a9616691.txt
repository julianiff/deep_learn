Abstract    :
              9616691  Cuker    This project represents a renewal of an ongoing  pioneering 
              program which seeks to increase the number of under-  represented minorities
              electing careers in aquatic sciences.  The program targets minority students,
              faculty, and  professionals interested in aquatic sciences, as well as 
              majority faculty working at Historically Minority Colleges  and Universities
              (HMCU's). The program is run in conjunction  with the American Society of
              Limnology and Oceanography  (ASLO)which provides program participants with free
               membership to the society including a subscription to the  societies Journal,
              "Limnology and Oceanography".  Participants apply through a formal process for 
              participation in the program and those selected are provided  with travel and
              per diem support to participate in the  Annual ASLO meeting and to attend
              special pre-planning  workshops. Participants are strongly encouraged to
              present  the results of any  research programs they are involved with  both in
              the regular sessions and sessions specifically  organized for them. The present
              program will cultivate the  further development of past participants and
              incorporate new  cohorts of students into the process. Since the programs 
              beginnings in 1990, it has supported 222 students and 16  faculty mentors.
              Through both proven and some novel  approaches this project will strengthen and
              expand the  linkages between minority students and the aquatic science 
              community.  ***
