              CISE/EHR/ENG/MPS Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies Program: 
              Planning Grant for Center for Collaborative Research in Learning Technologies
              based at Arizona State University    Arizona State University has been awarded
              funding in the amount of $50,000 for a 12 month planning grant for a Center to
              address the rapid development of two types of delivery systems - integrated
              software for science, engineering, and mathematics education use, and
              technology improvements for distributed/distance education.  The desired
              outcomes are to enhance the quality and accessibility of education at all
              academic levels, K-16, graduate, and extended education.  A key role of the
              Center will be to provide tools for functioning as team and facilitation of
              team processing.    Partners in this planning project include Motorola, Intel,
              Cox Communications, Peoples Choice, and the Foundation Coalition Schools.
