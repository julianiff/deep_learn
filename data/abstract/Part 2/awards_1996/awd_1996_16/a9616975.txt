              Earth Observatory  Title: Tree-Ring Data from Subantarctic Forests: Indices of 
              Southern Hemisphere Atmosphere-Ocean Climate Variability    This award supports
              the development of high-resolution, precisely-  dated tree-ring chronologies
              from data-sparse subantarctic regions,  including Tasmania, New Zealand and
              southern South America.  Such  records are essential for development of a
              network of Southern  Hemisphere paleoclimatic data comparable to that now
              available for  the Northern Hemisphere.  The subantarctic chronologies are 
              utilized in modeling and reconstruction of indices of temperature  and
              atmosphere-ocean circulation for the southern extratropical  latitudes.  The
              scientific team will 1. develop ring-width and  maximum latewood density
              chronologies for subantarctic forest  sites; 2. extend the paleotemperature
              records further back in time;  3. produce chronologies from several tree
              species; and 4. model and  reconstruct temperature and circulation indices for
              subantarctic  latitudes.  The information gleaned from this project will
              improve  our long-term (centuries to millennia) perspective of natural and 
              recent (possibly anthropogenic) climatic variability for a region  of the
              Southern Hemisphere with very sparse instrumental and  paleoclimatic data
              coverage.
