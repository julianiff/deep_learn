              Technology Transfer and Development of Transferrable Learning Technology:  A
              Center for Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies Based at
              Northwestern University    Northwestern University has been awarded funding in
              the amount of $50,000 for 12 months to plan an NSF Center for Collaborative
              Research on Learning Technologies with the theme of "Technology Transfer and
              the Development of Transferable Technology."  The mission of the Center will be
              two-fold.  The infrastructure mission of the Center will be to transfer
              learning technologies developed at Northwestern to teachers, and content
              learning for applications to science, mathematics, and technology education in
              schools, homes, and workplaces.  Its research mission, to be carried out
              collaboratively with these teachers and content experts, will be to develop and
              investigate tools and technologies for the design and implementation of
              education software that truly are transferable - i.e., tools and technologies
              that teachers and content experts can really use, even if they are not expert
              programmers, to develop new, high quality educational software applications
              that meet the needs of their students in science, mathematics and technology.
