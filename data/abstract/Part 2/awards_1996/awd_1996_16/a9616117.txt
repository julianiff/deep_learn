Abstract    :
                  Abstract  EEC-9616117  Niesz      The award is for a two year phase out  of
              the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Ceramic Research at
              Rutgers University.  There are currently 10 industrial partners and 4
              governmental agency partners.  The Center supports.  The research has 14
              individual projects that are organized into the following thrust areas:  (1)
              ceramic processing science and technology,  (2) electro ceramics,  (3)
              structural ceramics, and  (4) surface science.  The focus of the research is on
              developing the science and technology needed to synthesize advanced materials
              with microstructures/nanostructures needed to fulfill the property  and
              reliability requirements for emerging industrial applications.  The approach
              includes fundamental underqtanding of starting materials, chemistry ,
              processing parameters, characterization of the structure, and measurement of
              engineering properties.
