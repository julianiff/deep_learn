Abstract    :
                    Abstract  EEC-9616366  LaCourse    This award provides funding for the
              first year of a five-year continuing award that initiates the start of a
              multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Glass
              which started at Alfred University and now is incorporating the University of
              Missouri-Rolla.    The expanded research agenda with the University of
              Missouri-Rolla research site will address "A Baseline Study of Refractory Creep
              and MOE of Unaltered Glasstank Refractories," "Post-Corrosion Creep and MOE and
              Creep During Corrosion of Glassplant Refractories," "Glassplant Refractory
              Corrosion," "Thermal Shock and Thermal Stressing of Glasstank Refractories,"
              "Microscopic Characterization of Glass Defects, Structures and Glassplant
              Refractories," and "On-line Monitoring of Glasstank Corrosion by Ultrasonic and
              Electromagnetic Methods."
