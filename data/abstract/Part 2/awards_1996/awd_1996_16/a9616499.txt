Abstract    :

              CISE/EHR/ENG/MPS:  Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies: 
              Community-Based Learning Systems:  Exploring Models in Use.    Maricopa
              Technical Community College has been awarded $298,698 for a 1 year planning
              project that will use the motivational and social learning potential of
              Multiple User Design environments (MUDs or MUSEs) in conjunction with
              computational modeling to help students develop conceptual understanding of
              scientific concepts.  The social characteristics of MUDs, which students
              construct themselves, bring students into environments where they interact with
              adult mentors, including teachers, who expand student's horizons.  While
              engaging in their current state, MUDs can be transformed into powerful
              pedagogical spaces.  This planning project will develop the technological
              aspects of MUDs to integrate computational modeling, and define specific
              pedagogical goals, building on the work of  MariMuse with Longview Elementary
              School, a Title K-6 school, serving a culturally diverse population of
              students.  The project is a collaboration of Longview Elementary, Phoenix
              College (part of Maricopa Community College District, and Xerox Parc Alto
              Research Center.
