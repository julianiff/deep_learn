Abstract    :
              9616334  Sen Gupta  Description:  This is a U.S.-India research collaboration
              entitled  Elastic Scattering and Pair Production of 1.115 MeV Photons.  The 
              project is under the direction of Richard H. Pratt, University of  Pittsburgh
              and S.K. Sen Gupta, North Bengal University,  Darjeeling.  Simultaneous
              cooperative investigations, both  theoretical and experimental, are proposed on
              aspects of the related  processes of photon atom scattering and pair
              production, connected  through dispersion relations.  The project will focus on
              Delbruck  scattering and on atomic screening effects in pair production.  It is
               expected that the combination of new theoretical calculations and  new
              accurate experimental data will improve our understanding of  these important
              photon atom interaction processes.      Scope:  This collaboration is an
              outgrowth of a previously funded  INT/India Program activity.  The workshop on
              New Directions in  the Study of the Interaction of Energetic Photons with
              Matter was  held in Darjeeling in November 1995.  While the subject matter of 
              the workshop is a modern field, the long tradition of physics  research in both
              countries constitutes a strong basis for developing  ongoing cooperative
              activities.  In addition to the immediate  scientific benefit of the research,
              the collaboration will promote the   exchange of ideas, provide training of
              students, and foster their  exposure to the international scientific community.
