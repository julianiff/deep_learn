Abstract    :
              Abstract  9616338  Piccirillo  The relict thermal cosmic microwave background
              radiation left over from the big bang carries the only information that is
              available on the distribution of matter in the very early universe.  This award
              is for the US portion of a larger international (France, Italy and the US)
              collaboration which will measure the anisotropy of the CMBR from the new
              French/Italian station on Dome C in Antarctica (Concordia Station).  This is
              one of the highest and coldest sites presently occupied in Antarctica.  Because
              of the extreme cold there is very little water vapor in the atmosphere, and
              that means that it is likely to be a superb place from which to make CMBA
              anisotropy measurements. Evaluation of  the site for future use is also a major
              goal of this project.  ***
