Abstract    :
                9616624  Lee  The overall objective of this project in intelligent structural 
              systems is to advance the state-of-the-art and state-of-practice  of seismic
              protective systems technology.  In particular,  application to the construction
              of new and more advanced  structures and the rehabilitation of existing
              construction using  such intelligent technologies will be emphasized.  Special 
              attention is given to two important areas.  The first explores  the application
              of protective systems as a global retrofit for  welded moment-resisting steel
              frames under near-source seismic  conditions such as those experienced in
              recent Northridge and  Kobe earthquakes.  The second area addresses the
              technical and  fiscal implications of using protective systems to rehabilitate 
              masonry and non-ductile concrete buildings.  In addition,  theoretical and
              experimental studies will be undertaken to permit  the comprehensive evaluation
              and comparison of passive and semi-  active systems.    The following tasks
              will be performed to complete the proposed  research: (1) Test beds for
              performance, evaluation and  comparison; (2) Near-source ground motions; (3)
              Application to  welded moment-resisting steel frames; (4) Application to 
              rehabilitation of concrete and masonry buildings; and (5)  Development of
              simplified methods of analysis and design  guidelines.  ***
