Abstract    :
              This project involves the ethnographic field research of three anthropologists
              from the University of Washington in Torres Strait, Australia.  The goals are
              to study the link between reproductive strategies and subsistence among a
              tribal society, the Meriam people, a maritime foraging-horticultural society
              with minimal cash involvement.  The research will test two models: the
              childcare tradeoffs model which proposes that women's reproductive constraints
              shape their subsistence strategies, and the social benefits model, which
              proposes that male subsistence decisions often sacrifice household provisioning
              in order to enhance status by sharing resources widely or demonstrating prowess
              and risk-taking.  Previous research has suggested that Meriam women choose less
              productive resources due to risk aversion rather than childcare constraints,
              while men choose less productive resources because of a seeming preference for
              greater risk.  The methods include generalized participant observation, and
              detailed monitoring of the choices of women and men foraging with small
              children in marine habitats.  Detailed time-allocation, productivity, and
              exchange records will be kept.   This research is important because it will
              advance our understanding of the consequences and causes of sexual division of
              labor through the critical examination of some widely-held theories.  The
              results should illuminate the circumstance which might motivate men to seek a
              household provisioning strategy rather than a status enhancing one.
