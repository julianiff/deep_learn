Abstract    :
              Strauss, Michael  96-16901    Dr. Strauss plans to combine observational data 
              and theoretical analyses to constrain the standard  model for the evolution of
              the universe and its  formation of structure.  The observations include  two
              all-sky photometric and spectroscopic surveys  of galaxies to measure the
              large-scale bulk flow  of galaxies.  Also planned is a detailed  statistical
              comparison of the large-scale  distribution of galaxies of different 
              morphological types to constrain physical models  for the relatite distribution
              of galaxies and dark  matter.  The final portions of the research are to 
              compare the observed galaxy density and velocity  fields, to test the
              gravitational instability  paradigm and to constrain the Cosmological Density 
              Parameter.
