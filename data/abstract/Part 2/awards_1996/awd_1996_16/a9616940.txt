Abstract    :
              Wilcots, Eric  AST 96-16907    Dr. Wilcots will study the structure,
              distribution,  kinematics and other properties of giant H I envelopes  around
              irregular galaxies.  The project has four specific  goals -- to reveal what, if
              any, structure there is in the  extended gas; to measure the kinematics of the
              far-flung  gas; to determine the relationship between the gas in the  outer
              parts of the galaxy with that in the inner parts; and  to determine the
              relationship between the extended gas and  the star formation history of the
              optical galaxy.    This is a collaborative project with Dr. Deidre Hunter at 
              the Lowell Observatory through AST 96-16940.
