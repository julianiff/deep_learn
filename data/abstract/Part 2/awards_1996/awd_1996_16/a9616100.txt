Abstract    :
              Bradley  9616100    Recent theories suggest that development of the control of 
              movement emerges from the interactions of multiple  developing systems under
              genetic control with environment-  based experiences. This project uses
              synchronized video  recording of movements and electromyographic recording of 
              muscle activity to measure body movements at four different  ages of embryonic
              development, and investigates the  transformations that occur over this period
              of development.  The studies also investigate whether mechanically imposed 
              changes in the embryo's environment affect the development  of the nervous
              system's control of movement. These studies  are important in that the findings
              provide quantitative  information as to whether movement experiences during 
              embryonic development contribute to the developmental  refinement of normal
              motor behavior. The results provide the  basis for investigating whether
              movement experiences during  embryonic development play a significant role in
              the  acquisition of complex, adaptive skills and whether atypical  movement
              experiences during embryonic development lead to  persistent atypical motor
              behaviors.
