Abstract    :
              This project connects two educational sites to the Internet over a 56kbps line. 
              The two sites to be connected are in Seward:  the Seward Marine Center of the
              University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Alaska Vocational Technical Center, a
              state-funded post-secondary educational institution.  Faculty and students at
              the schools benefit from access to the resources of the Internet, including
              libraries and supercomputers.  In addition, they are able to communicate and
              collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of research and
              educational projects.  The award provides partial support of the project for
              two years.
