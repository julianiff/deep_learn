Abstract    :
              9616441  Dev, Pravati  Stanford University    Design-Based Learning of
              Vertebrate Biology, Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of Virtual Creatures   
              Stanford University has been awarded $215,498 for a one-year planning grant to
              help integrate pre-college education implementation and research questions and
              strategies with an ambitious program of developing advanced computer-based
              tools for teaching biology at the secondary and undergraduate levels. Prior
              efforts to create interactive virtual creatures have restricted interaction to
              viewing selected structures.  This project will develop and evaluate for their
              educational efficacy a small library of transitional creatures that will allow
              virtual dissection and other simulated physical manipulations on a personal
              computer.
