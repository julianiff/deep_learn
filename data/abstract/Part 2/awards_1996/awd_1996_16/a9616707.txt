Abstract    :
              This research examines the relationship between nutrition and infant
              temperament. Temperament refers to individual differences in behavioral
              tendencies that are stable across time and situations, and that appear very
              early in infancy. The study builds on previous research conducted in Guatemala,
              involving a group of women, some of whom had received nutritional supplements
              when they were children and some of whom had not. The same women are now of
              child-bearing age and have children of their own. The current project will
              examine whether a mother's own nutritional history during early childhood can
              influence her childrens' temperament, cognitive capabilities, and nutritional
              intake. It is expected that inadequately nourished children whose mothers did
              not receive nutritional supplements during their childhood will show a
              temperament pattern involving lower levels of: positive emotionality, activity,
              soothability and cooperativeness. These children are also expected to show
              higher levels of: negative emotionality, inhibition, and distress. In contrast,
              it is expected that adequately nourished children whose mothers did receive
              nutritional supplements during their childhood will show the reverse pattern of
              temperament. The research has strong potential for broadening our knowledge of
              biologically-based behavior, and for refining our understanding of the
              relationship between nutrition and individual differences in behavior.
