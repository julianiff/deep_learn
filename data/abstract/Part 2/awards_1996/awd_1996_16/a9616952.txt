Abstract    :
              9616952    Bower, Rogerson    In  this  project,  the  PIs will continue the 
              investigation  of  mechanisms  of  eddy  (meddy) formation  in  the  region  of
               the  Mediterranean  outflow.   Analysis of float  data  from  a  field 
              experiment   (AMUSE:   A   Mediterranean   Undercurrent   Seeding  Experiment) 
              will be continued, in conjunction  with  other  data  sets,  particularly using
              satellite altimetry.   Process-oriented  numerical  simulations will be used to
              address specific  physical  mechanisms associated with meddy formation and
              propagation.
