              Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies:  The Portal Project    The
              Education Development Center, Inc. has been awarded $684.260 for a 24-month
              period to develop computational tools, with access to World Wide Web resources,
              to support effective learning and integration of computational processes with
              real-world research problems.  This software consists of a suite of
              computer-based, Web-enabled programs for systematically documenting, examining,
              and offering feedback on students' project work.  The goals of the project are:
               (1) to develop the Portal Tools; (2) to implement the tools in up to 70
              schools in five states; and (3) to evaluate the impact of the tools on student
              learning, through case studies and analysis of student presentations and
              process documents.
