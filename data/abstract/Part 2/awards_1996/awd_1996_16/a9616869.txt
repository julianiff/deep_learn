Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT        Proposal Number: CTS9616869  Principle Investigator:  Nakato    
              This is a grant for travel support for US students to participate in the 27th
              Congress of the International Association for Hydraulic Research to be held in
              San Francisco on August 10-15, 1997.  The last time that this congress was held
              in the US was in 1967.  This grant will provide direct support for the John F.
              Kennedy Student Paper Competition.  It is the specific aim of this activity to
              enhance the capability for fluid mechanics research in the broad area of
              hydraulic and environmental engineering by encouraging our best students to
              remain in the field.  The support of fluid mechanics in these fields is one of
              the central themes of the Fluid Dynamics and Hydraulics Program.  A small
              investment in the best of our students in this field will yield a large payoff
              in terms of future capability in a field of engineering that will have a great
              impact in meeting societal needs in the future.  The University of Iowa has
              agreed to cost share on a dollar for dollar basis.  ***              Roger E.A.
