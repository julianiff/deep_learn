Abstract    :
              9616302  Qamar       This award supports the cost of installing a network of 
              continuously recording Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers  in the state
              of Washington for the purpose of measuring ground  motion associated with
              subduction zone tectonics, volcanic  activity, and earthquakes. The Principal
              Investigator will  coordinate the installation and operation of the network
              from the  University of Washington. The basic research goal of the 
              measurements to be taken by the network is an understanding of  the processes
              leading to deformation of the continental crust in  the Pacific Northwest
              region due to the combination of forces  from the oblique subduction of the
              Juan de Fuca plate, the  entrainment of the Sierra NevadaOregon Coast Range
              block, and the  local forces created by the topographic gradient from the Basin
               and Range to the Columbia Basin. The network is also expected to  provide
              important data for improved assessment of the seismic and  volcanic risk in the
              region.  ***
