              Penland, Cecile  University of Colopado  Title: An Investigation of the Nature
              and Predictability of El  Nino-Southern Oscillation Using Statistical and
              Dynamical Modeling  Approaches    This proposal will deal with the relative
              importance of nonlinear  dynamics and stochastic processes in the short term
              climate  variability in the tropics, such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation 
              (ENSO).  At issue is whether underlying dynamics of the  variabilities are
              stable, how much nonlinear structure is imbedded  in them and what impact the
              different dynamics have to the  predictive skill of a model.  To shed light on
              these issues, it is  proposed to conduct a series of numerical experiments with
              both  statistical and dynamical models.  This research will enhance our 
              knowledge of the nature of ENSO and might strengthen our ability to  predict
              ENSO.
