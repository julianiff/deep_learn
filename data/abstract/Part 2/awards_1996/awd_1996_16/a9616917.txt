Abstract    :
              Neugebauer, Gerry  96-16917    Dr. Neugebauer will conduct deep near-infrared 
              surveys at wavelengths of 2.2 and 3.5 microns with  the Palomar 5-m and the
              Keck 10-m telescopes.  The  goal is to determine the morphologies, visible(- 
              )near-infrared colors and clustering properties of  faint galaxies from deep
              surveys.  The imaging of  faint galaxies provides number counts, which are 
              used to constrain cosmological parameters, to  search for new faint populations
              and to estimate  the formation epoch of the dominant population.
