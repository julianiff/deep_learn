Abstract    :
                    Abstract  EEC-9616415      An important need exists to improve the
              understanding of the musculoskeletal system of the human body to be able to
              design and manufacture implants that mimie human motions.  Research with
              computers, engineering analysis, and simulation and engineering design
              techniques could contribute to better health and be valuable to rehabilitation
              and manufacturers of inplants.  The Colorado School of Mines in collaboration
              with the Rose Musculoskeletal Research Laboratory and the University of
              Colorado's Medical School will hold an industry/university planning meeting to
              determine the economic viability of forming an Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for Musculoskeletal System Analysis.    The proposed I/UCRC
              research agenda will study the kinematics of joints, concentrating on the knee
              with projects on "Image-Based Sensing," "Portable Sensing Systems," "Modeling
              and Simulation," and "Advanced Biomaterials."
