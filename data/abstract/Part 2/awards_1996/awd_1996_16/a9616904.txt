Abstract    :
              This project is an ethnography of the social and cultural worlds of ;modern
              cosmology and cosmologists.  A contribution to the emerging field of
              anthropology of science, it endeavors to open up new perspectives for studying
              the relationships between culture and knowledge production in scientific
              communities.  Although cosmology is a traditional subject in anthropology, no
              one has of yet turned an anthropological eye to the making of our own culture's
              scientific cosmologies.  The concept of cultural contact, central to this
              inquiry, will be used as a theoretical lens to investigate how researchers from
              very different scientific lifeworlds -- theoretical particle physics,
              observational astronomy, and theoretical astrophysics -- are interacting and
              negotiating with one another in constructing a picture of the origin and
              evolution of the universe.  Methodologies will include 1) interviews; 2)
              observations of cosmologists in their work settings, e.g. research group
              meeting, informal lunchtime discussions, seminars, and national conferences; 3)
              analysis of the scientific literature, both technical and popular; and 4)
              examination of how institutional forms -- departments, journals, conferences,
              interdisciplinary centers -- are changing due to the interdisciplinary
              interactions in this field.
