Abstract    :
              The Mathematical Association of America through its Strengthening
              Underrepersented Minority Mathematics Achievement program in partnership with
              Arizona State University and in collaboration with the High Plains Rural
              Systemic Initiative will conduct a 30 month Workshop to Enhance Native American
              Faculty and teacher aides in the use of Calculators in Teaching (ENACT).   
              This will be a 30 month enhancing teacher project for 30 tribal college
              mathematics faculty members and 50 American Indian teacher aides.    The
              Project Director, Professor Robert Megginson, with five other senior staff
              members will teach the use of the Texas Instruments TI-83 graphing calcutor in
              teaching.  Modern pedagogy will be demonstrated in two workshops.  The first
              will be a two-week workshop and held in August 1997 and the second in August
              1998 will be three weeks.
