              Research on Learning Technologies: Teacher Researcher Collaboration in
              Scientific Modeling: The High School Science Virtual Machine Laboratory   
              Boston University has been awarded $858,545 to establish over 3 years an
              approach to high school science education by allowing students to model and
              visualize physical, chemical and biological phenomena of increasing complexity.
               The project will take advantage of two advances in technology: One is the
              emergence of JAVA, a platform independent language that enables transmission of
              applications over the WEB to run locally on any platform.  The other is the
              existence of public domain versions of distributed parallel computing operating
              systems.  One such system, PVM, will be used and modified to enable students to
              use many computers in a school as a larger parallel computer.  The tools and
              applications will be used by the researchers and teams of high school teachers
              to develop education-oriented modeling programs that do not sacrifice needed
              functionality or sophistication.
