Abstract    :
                The objective of the proposal is to produce, in a laboratory plasma  device,
              unstable electromagnetic ion-temperature-anisotropy (EMITA)  driven waves. 
              According to the theory to be tested, a high B  plasma and a substantial ion
              temperature anisotropy are required.   The plasma will be generated with an
              inductively coupled "helicon"  source that has been enhanced by the addition of
              ion cyclotron  resonant heating.  The additional perpendicular heating permits 
              adjustment of the ion temperature anisotropy and raises the ion  temperature to
              the electron temperature.  An attempt to achieve a  high B plasma will involve
              letting the plasma expand in to a low  magnetic field chamber mated to the end
              of the helicon source.  The  chamber is large enough so that the ion gyroradius
              is smaller than  the chamber diameter.  The goal of the laboratory experiment
              is to  provide enough information to benchmark the theoretically predicted 
              behavior of the EMITA instability.  This instability has been  proposed as
              important in the magnetosheath and has been studied  with AMPTEE/CCE
              measurements.
