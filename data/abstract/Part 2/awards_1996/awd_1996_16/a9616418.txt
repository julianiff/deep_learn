Abstract    :
              Licis  9616418    A conference, entitled "Clean Products and Processes", is
              proposed for May 4-8, 1997.  The conference is to address state of the art
              developments in pollution prevention and sustainable technology, with an
              emphasis on clean products and processes.    The objective of the conference is
              to bring together recognized experts from industry, academia and government for
              the purpose of presenting, exchanging and discussing information dealing with
              the cooperative design, development, manufacture and use of products and
              processes that provide reduced risked to human health and the ecology.  More
              specifically, the conference will provide a forum for exchange of information
              covering topics such as clean product technologies, green chemistry and
              engineering, life cycle analysis (LCA) and full cost accounting, computer based
              design tools, clean energy production and use, and applied pollution prevention
              (P2) solutions.    The expected benefits are the stimulation, growth and
              advancement of pollution prevention practices on an international scale.    The
              Engineering Foundation (New York) will assume prime responsibility for
              admission, logistics, mechanics, publicity, coordination of housing, and
              finances for the conference.  ***
