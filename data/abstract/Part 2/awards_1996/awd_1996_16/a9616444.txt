              Boxes:  Bringing Transparency and Aesthetics back to Scientific Instruments   
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology has been awarded $880,658 over 3 years
              for a collaborative project between MIT, Wellesley College and the University
              of Colorado, to develop computational tools and project materials to allow
              children to create their own scientific instruments, engaging them in designing
              and building, as well as in observing, measuring and interpreting.  It is
              hypothesized that more students, like scientists of old, will be motivated to
              participate in scientific activities, and in addition the design process will
              help them develop critical capacities for evaluation.  The project promises to
              provide students with deeper understanding of the relationships between science
              and technology, and between science and the real world.    The project will
              develop a family of tiny, fully  programmable computational devices (crickets)
              that students can embed in everyday objects.  Crickets can control motors and
              lights, receive information from sensors and communicate with one another via
              infrared light.  The technologies will be evaluated in a range of settings,
              including work with teachers in classrooms and a vocational-technical school. 
              In addition to testing their hypothesis, the PI's will evaluate theoretical
              learning issues of balance between physical and virtual objects, and between
              "transparent" and "opaque" objects.
