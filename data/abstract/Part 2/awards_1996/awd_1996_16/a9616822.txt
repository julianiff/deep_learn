Abstract    :
              Weinberg, David  AST 96-16822    Dr. Weinberg will improve the Gaussian-mapping
              method for  studying cosmic structure formation by combining it with a 
              dynamical reconstruction technique.  The improved method  will be applied to
              the IRAS Point-Source Catalog Redshift  Survey and to the Optical Redshift
              Survey.  The  reconstruction results for different cosmological  parameters
              will be evaluated by comparing observed and  reconstructed galaxy density
              fields and will also be  compared to data from galaxy peculiar velocity
              surveys.
