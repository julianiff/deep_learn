Abstract    :
              SRS 96-16497  Ailes  The objective of this project is to conduct a
              cross-national  comparative study of the strategic planning process for 
              science and technology (S&T) and its outcomes in seven  countries.  Among the
              outcomes to be studied would be the  relative efficacy of strategic planning
              processes in each  country in incorporating S&T resources and outputs into its 
              respective innovation system.  The project will result in a  model, including
              proposed quantitative indicators, that  could be used to assess and monitor
              strategic planning for  S&T and S&T capabilities, not only in the seven
              selected  countries, but in other countries  as well--including the  United
              States.  ***
