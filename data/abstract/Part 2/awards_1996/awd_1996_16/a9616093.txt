Abstract    :
                Boss, Alan  AST 96-16093      Recent observational evidence indicates that
              stars form in  pairs, or as binary systems, rather than  singly, like our sun.
              Conditions required to form binary  stars are poorly understood, and most 
              theoretical modeling has concentrated on studying single  star formation.  Dr.
              Boss will rectify  this situation by carrying out research into the processes 
              that lead to binary star formation.  His program will improve understanding of
              the fragmentation  process which occurs during  protostellar collapse in
              molecular clouds, and his  theoretical models will include effects such as 
              mass accretion, orbital mergers and initial magnetic fields,  all previously
              neglected in theoretical  treatments, but recognized to be potentially
              important.  His  work will follow the orbital evolution  of the binary
              fragments for much longer times than is  typical in models, as the fragments
              interact  with the residual disk and cloud envelope.  Dr. Boss's work  is
              closely tied to observations, both  through the initial conditions of his
              models and through the  resulting calculation of line emission  from the
              protostellar fragments for comparison with  observations of star-forming
              regions.   His  results will also allow the determination of the minimum  mass
              of a protostellar fragment, which  has bearing on the discrimination between
              brown dwarf stars  and giant planets, and the  interpretation of recent
              observational detection of  companions to solar-type stars.  ***
