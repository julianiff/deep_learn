Abstract    :
              9616585  Schlager, Mark  SRI International    CRLT:  TAPPED IN MUVEs to the Web:
               A Web-Aware Multi-User Virtual Environment for Studying On-line Collaboration 
                SRI International has been awarded funding in the amount of $149,318 for a
              period of 12 months.  SRI and several San Francisco Bay Area K-12 science
              professional development providers (six Lawrence Hall of Science programs, Life
              Science Program, California Science Project, and the Science Education of the
              Bay Area) will jointly develop a new vision of on-line professional development
              activities in a place where teachers with diverse interest, skills, and
              backgrounds can meet and learn from one another on any given day; where
              teachers can be exposed to not one but many education reform concepts and
              approaches;  where teachers can find quality resources in minutes rather than
              hours;  and add and annotate resources that they find useful.  The goals of
              this project are to (a) scale up from prototype to implementation and (b) to
              conduct the research needed to assess the utility of the concept and technology
              and inform the development of future collaborative on-line learning
              communities.
