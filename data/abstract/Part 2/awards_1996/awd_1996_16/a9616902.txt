Abstract    :
              9616902  Santamarina    Wave emission is the sudden release of energy in the
              form of  transient  waves.  Electromagnetic and mechanical waves provide 
              different and  complimentary information about source mechanisms and  material
              properties  inherent to the medium.  The emission of electromagnetic  waves is
              supported  by the principle of energy conservation, Le Chatelier's  principle,
              and  energy coupling phenomena.  Preliminary tests conducted on  intact rock 
              specimens showed evidence of electromagnetic emissions.    This Small Grant for
              Exploratory Research explores the  significance of  energy coupling and
              electromagnetic emissions in selected  rocks and soils.  Experimental materials
              will be selected to isolate or  highlight specific  emission requirements. 
              Results will be interpreted within  the context of  hypothesized emission
              mechanisms, fulfilling energy balance.  Emphasis will  be placed on coupling
              mechanisms that justify emissions in  the  radio-frequencies so that waves have
              significant penetration  depth through  geomaterials to allow for remote
              detection (including  piezoelectricity,  charge separation, and double layer
              polarization.  Complementary research  tasks include the enhancement and
              calibration of the  monitoring system, and  the characterization of signatures
              from pure failure modes  in rock.  ***
