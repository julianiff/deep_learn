Abstract    :
              Krolik, Julian  96-16922    Dr. Krolik will study the possible structures of 
              accretion onto massive black holes.  Current views  cover the range from a
              thin, cool, very dense disk  to a quasi-spherical two temperature plasma.  The 
              goal of this study is to evaluate the plausibility  of the current models and
              perhaps find additional  ones.  Also included will be the calculation of  new
              predictions made by the various candidate  models, so that further
              observational tests may be  applied to them.
