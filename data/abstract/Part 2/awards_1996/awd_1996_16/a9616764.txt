Abstract    :
              9616764 Sussman, Gerald J.  The goal of this research is to create the
              architectural and algorithmic foundations for intelligent analysis and
              interpretation of massive numerical datasets.  The aim is to provide the
              technology to reduce the complexity in the analysis of specific engineering
              problems, and at the same time use these specific problems as a focus to
              develop general principles that advance the frontiers of Artificial
              Intelligence.   Smart data interpretation programs must exploit visual
              recognition and symbolic abstraction capabilities.  Tracking a multiplicity of
              interacting, deforming objects might well be too taxing for the human visual
              system.  It is both necessary and exciting to endow our computers with the
              capability to draw pictures for themselves to see and use what they saw to
              guide their own future actions.  AI programs that integrate 'reasoning with
              images" with symbolic computations have been implemented to solve problems in
              several applications areas, such as dynamical system analysis, controller
              design, mechanism kinematics.  This paradigm can be expected to be integral
              part of future engineering analysis and design environments.   A computational
              environment will be provided for fluid dynamicists to efficiently extract
              structures and isolate interaction patterns form simulated or experimental
              turbulence data, and to perform control experiments on structure interactions. 
               The objectives are : (1) to cut post-processing time of CFD data by one to two
              order of magnitude, (2) to provide symbolic descriptions of data for
              summarization and comparison, and (3) to develop symbolic and geometric
              techniques to encode coherent structures, their evolution, and interactions
              rules. ***
