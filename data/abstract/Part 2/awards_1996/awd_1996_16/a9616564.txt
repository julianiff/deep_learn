              Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies Program:  Toward the
              Development of a Center for Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies   
              The Exploratorium in San Francisco, California has been awarded funding in the
              amount of $50,000 for a period of 12 months to initiate a planning effort
              leading to the creation of a Center for Collaborative Research on Learning
              Technologies.  The Center will draw upon the efforts and expertise of a wide
              ranging group of San Francisco Bay Area participants from industry, research,
              and education to formulate powerful responses to challenges and opportunities
              in science, mathematics, engineering and technology education.  During the
              proposed planning period, the Center will initiate reexamination of the basic
              methods and practices of these fields in light of the pedagogical potential to
              newly developing learning technologies.    At the heart of the Center's
              activities will be a set of carefully selected projects that address major
              educational challenges and opportunities.  The Center is particularly
              interested in projects that focus on the convergence of new hybrid
              technically-augmented learning spaces/situations and new pedagogical theory. 
              By focusing efforts on a specific problem or content area of sufficiently wide
              interest to the fields, the Center will be able to identify core issues for
              education as a whole; and thus be able to design generalizable research
              strategies.  It is anticipated that important work will be undertaken by
              members from primary and secondary school system and by informal educations
              (such as directors of public libraries or broadcasting groups) of different
              kinds.
