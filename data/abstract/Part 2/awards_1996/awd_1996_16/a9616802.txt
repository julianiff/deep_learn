Abstract    :
              McGovern  CUNY-Hunter College      This is a dissertation improvement grant
              proposal to fund the work of Jim Woollett.  The project examines subsistence 
              and cultural change in Labrador Inuit culture.  Consideration of subsistence
              economy in the study of contact-period cultural change has hinged upon
              ethnohistoric and possibilistic interpretations.   This project combines
              zooarchaeological and archaeobotanical analyses of the existing collections
              produced from recent excavations at several sites in Labrador with oral history
              studies that address local environment and land-use patterns.  The study will
              link changing economic behavior to social and environmental causes, most
              particularly through detailed studies of the organization and scheduling of
              seal and whale hunting.
