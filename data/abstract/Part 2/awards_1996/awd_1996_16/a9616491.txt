Abstract    :
              Freeman  9616491    This award assists in the transfer of the mammal collection
              of some 4368   specimens from Chadron State College to the University of
              Nebraska State   Museum.  This is a significant collection, primarily from the
              Pine Ridge area   of Nebraska, and it complements the existing collection at
              the University. The   combined collection will be among the top 30 such
              collections in North   America, with good documentation of reproductive and
              ectoparasite status of   the specimens.  The project is a partnership among
              Chadron State College   (which is covering 18% of the total), the University of
              Nebraska (which is   covering 37%), and the Research Collections in Systematics
              and Ecology   program of NSF (which is covering 45% of the total).  This
              project has well-  thought out procedures that are time- and cost-effective,
              the transfer of   ownership of the specimens has been made clear in a
              Memorandum of   Understanding, and the Chadron State curator is deeply involved
              in the   project.  When complete, the mammal collection at the University of  
              Nebraska will contribute significantly to research and education, as well as  
              public outreach.
