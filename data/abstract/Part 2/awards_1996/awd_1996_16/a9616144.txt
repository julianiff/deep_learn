Abstract    :
              9716144  Randall  This is an award to support research the objective of which is
              to  provide a more rational basis than now exists for design of  biologically
              based wastewater treatment processes that have the  capability for reducing the
              phosphorus content of their  effluents.  The research involves determination of
              conditions  that necessitate the need for a prefermentation phase to produce 
              nonvolatile fatty acids in comparison with conditions where the 
              anaerobic/reaction phase of the treatment process precludes need  for a
              prefermentation phase.    Results of this research are expected to be used in
              determination  of conditions under which prefermentation is a necessary step in
               enhanced removal of phosphorus from wastewater by use of  biological
              processes.  This knowledge is expected to be used in  improving the engineering
              design of biologically-based,  phosphorus removal processes and systems. 
              Biologically-based  processes have the advantage over physical-chemical
              processes in  reducing the amounts of process residuals, improved dewatering 
              characteristics of the residuals and capability of being  integrated with
              biologically-based denitrification processes.  ***
