Abstract    :
              SOIFER, Baruch  AST 96-16924    Dr. Soifer will study infrared luminous
              galaxies.  The  goals of this project will be to understand how the  strongest
              starbursts evolve by studying the closest high  luminosity starburst systems,
              also to explore the  relationship between starbursts and non-stellar power 
              sources in the most luminous of these systems and to probe  the evolutionary
              connection between interacting galaxies  and AGNs.  The projects will be based
              on infrared  observations using the Palomar and Keck telescopes for 
              spectroscopy and for imaging selected samples of infrared  luminous galaxies.
