Abstract    :
              Despite the facts that automated image analysis has been and continues to be a
              very active research area and this PI and others have demonstrated that
              incorporation of knowledge into the process can significantly improve its
              robustness and accuracy, there is only very limited knowledge applicable to the
              general problem of designing knowledge-based image analysis systems.  This
              research begins with the hypotheses that (1) A general image analysis system
              can be developed for families of similar image analysis applications; (2)
              Knowledge can be automatically or semi-automatically derived from
              application-specific training sets of manually analyzed example images; (3)
              General knowledge-based image analysis systems trained on such training sets
              can offer performance comparable to single-purpose knowledge-based systems
              specifically designed for the particular task.  Since the general problem is
              quite broad, the specific aims are to (1) Develop a unifying approach to
              example-based acquisition and representation of knowledge about image edges
              derived from example images in a variety of border detection applications; (2)
              Develop a general approach to automated border detection learning utilizing
              knowledge acquired from examples in this fashion; (3) Assess the applicability
              of the developed approaches by testing their robustness and accuracy in large
              data sets of complex images from actual applications.  This research, which
              will be carried out in the context of medical image analysis, such as 
              angiographic images, intravascular and intracardiac ultrasound images, and
              multidimensional high resolution CT images, will open new routes to automated
              and practically applicable machine learning strategies in image analysis and
              image understanding applications.
