Abstract    :
              9616882  Crabtree  This proposal requests partial support for the annual summer
              research conference on Transcription which will be held from August 10-15, 1996
              at the conference center at Snowmass Village, Colorado.  The primary objective
              of this meeting is to bring together researchers who study transcription in
              many different biologic contexts.  Because of the diversity of biologic events
              controlled by transcription, the meeting offers the opportunity for researchers
              in many different areas to come together to focus on the unique contributions
              of transcription to their individual studies.  The meeting will begin with
              sessions designed to explore the structure and function of the basal
              transcription apparatus and the contributions of chromatin to the control of
              transcription.  Later sessions will emphasize the contribution of transcription
              in recombination and repair, the action of hormones, and signal transduction. 
              Other sessions will emphasize the role of transcription in regulating the cell
              cycle, transcriptional mechanisms used by oncogenes and viruses, and finally
              the contribution of transcriptional control mechanisms to the determination of
              cell type.  ***
