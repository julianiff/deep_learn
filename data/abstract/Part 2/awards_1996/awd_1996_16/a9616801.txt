Abstract    :
              This project is designed to follow up two national surveys in which
              psychologists   and psychology students were asked about their attitudes toward
              the use of animals  in psychological research and teaching. The focus of the
              present study will be on an important but neglected aspect of the animal
              research enterprise-the role of institutional animal care and use committees
              (IACUCs). As mandated by law, these committees are responsible for approving
              studies and for assuring that laboratory animals are treated humanely.
              Consequently, they provide an ideal vehicle for understanding the decision
              processes that underlie scientific and ethical judgments of animal research. In
              the proposed study, 50 IACUCs will review four randomly assigned animal
              research proposals that have been recently reviewed at another participating
              institution. In addition, the approximately 500 individuals serving on these
              committees will be asked to evaluate various dimensions of each research
              proposal (e.g., scientific merit, clinical value) and to complete several items
              from the earlier survey of psychologists.  This combination of committee-level
              data and individual-member data will be used to generate statistical models of
              IACUC decision making, and they will permit, for the first time, quantitative
              estimates of the inter-committee reliability of IACUC recommendations. The goal
              of these analyses will be primarily twofold: to understand the psychological
              factors associated with IACUC decision making, and to suggest policy-oriented
              strategies designed to maximize the reliability of protocol reviews.
