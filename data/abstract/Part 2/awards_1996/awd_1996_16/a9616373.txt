              Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies:  Taming the Complexities of
              Modern Manufacturing: A Network Enabled Virtual Factory to Support the
              Exploration and Learning in Engineering Education    The University of Southern
              California has been awarded a 1-year grant of $237,298 to start on the
              development of a virtual factory on the World Wide Web to present manufacturing
              complexities in an understandable form for university engineering students. 
              University instructors will use the workspace to illustrate the concepts of
              factors management in a realistic setting, and students will assume roles of
              various factory personnel in small team settings.  Student teams may span
              institutional boundaries thus allowing information-sharing among students and
              professors at a number of institutions.
