Abstract    :
              9616880  Shklovskii  This grant to a senior, distinguished theorist involves 
              study of interplay between disorder and coulomb interaction,  a subject to
              which he has made several seminal  contributions.  This grant consists of three
              related  projects, all involving low to moderate magnetic fields.  In  one, the
              PI proposes to study the transport properties of a  crystal of charged bubbles
              (clusters of electrons) that has  recently been proposed as a possible ground
              state of a layer  of electrons in low magnetic fields.  In another project, 
              there are plans to study the crossover between the moderate  magnetic field
              regime represented by quantum Hall effect and  the oscillations in resisitivity
              at low fields, the  Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations.  Finally, there is a
              project  to study quantum version of the Coulomb gap, expected to be  present
              during a metal-insulator transition or near a  transition between the two
              plateaus in the quantum Hall  effect regime.  %%%  This grant to a senior,
              distinguished, theoretical physicist  is to study the subtle and complex
              properties of a thin  layer of electrons.  This PI is well known for his
              seminal  contributions to this subject.  In this grant, the work will 
              concentrate on the effects of impurities and interaction  between electron on
              electrical current in the presence of a  moderate magnetic field.  All of the
              projects involve  sophisticated state-of-the-art mathematical machinery and 
              includes further development of these mathematical tools.
