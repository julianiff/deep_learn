Abstract    :
                                                This award from the Chemistry Research
              Instrumentation and Facilities Program (CRIF) will  assist the Department of
              Chemistry at Gonzaga University to acquire a fourier-transform infrared 
              spectrometer (FT-IR). This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including the  following: (1) new solid state materials, (2) synthesis of
              transition metal porphyrin complexes,  and (3) synthesis and characterization
              of biomolecular analogs.     A fourier-transform infrared spectrometer can
              provide important information about chemical  reactivity. Its use may enable
              breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties of reactive  and
              nonreactive molecules.
