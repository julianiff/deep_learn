Abstract    :
                9616105 McNeil  This research project aims to gain fundamental understanding
              of an unusual physical transformation in Ge. At very high Kr ion irradiation
              doses, Ge converts from an amorphous to a highly networked spongy structure. A
              similar transformation is not observed in Si, or most other materials. The
              approach is to investigate the transformation phenomena in a Si(1-x)Gex alloy
              series with x spanning the range of 1 to 0, and also to investigate and
              characterize the optical properties of the irradiated materials. The project is
              collaborative between UNC and Argonne National Laboratory, and the research is
              expected to provide new fundamental information and insights into radiation
              effects and optical properties of semiconductor materials. %%% The project is
              multidisciplinary combining materials physics and processing studies with
              advanced characterization tools and analysis methods to address forefront
              research issues in a topical area of technological relevance.  The research
              will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to
              important aspects of processing and fabricating electronic/photonic devices and
              integrated circuitry.  Additionally, the knowledge and understanding gained
              from this research project is expected to contribute in a general way to
              improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a
              fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved
              materials, and materials combinations.  An important feature of the program is
              the integration of research and education through the training of students in a
              fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***
