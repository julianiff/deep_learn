Abstract    :
              ***  9616955  Woo      This award is to conduct the annual National Science
              Foundation Design and Manufacturing Grantees Conference.  The conference will
              involve researchers from the Division of Design, Manufacture and Industrial
              Innovation, the Division of Engineering Education and Centers, the Division of
              Electrical and Communication Systems and the Mechanics and Materials Program in
              the Division of Civil and Mechanical Structures, located within the Directorate
              for Engineering, the Division of Information, Robotics and Intelligent Systems,
              located within the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and
              Engineering and manufacturing related projects in the Division of Materials
              Research, located within the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
              Sciences.      The conference ensures that the individual researchers are
              informed about the ongoing activities of their colleagues.  An elimination of
              duplication of their efforts may be achieved and a degree of cooperation may
              result from this activity.  An overall improvement of efficiency of the
              research activity could be expected.  In addition, the conference program
              organization allows for ample time to discuss manufacturing research in detail
              with the collective research community at the meeting, with feedback to and
              input from the National Science Foundation.  Finally personal contacts between
              the grantees and program directors in the Divisions should contribute to
              clarifying many current issues in their work.   The aims of the conference are
              to enhance communication between researchers, encourage joint research, promote
              synergism, and develop networks for technical interchange.  Attendees to the
              conference gain an early access to the information disseminated.    ***
