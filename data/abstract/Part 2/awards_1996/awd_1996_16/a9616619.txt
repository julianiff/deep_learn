Abstract    :
              The Correspondence of Charles Darwin is making available, for the first time,
              full, authoritative texts, edited according to modern textual principles and
              practices, of all the extant, known letters written and received by Charles
              Darwin.  Darwin's correspondence, because it is so rich in information about
              his life and work, is a prime source for understanding the intellectual
              revolution in which he was the central figure.  As is well known from his
              publications, Darwin was a great questioner, observer, experimenter, and
              synthesizer, and his letters illustrate these capacities in abundant detail. 
              They also reveal how he went about his work and, what does not appear in his
              publications, his doubts and anxieties, his false starts and disappointments. 
              The letters concerned with his research reveal the extraordinary extent of
              Darwin's relationships with other scientists and informants--relationships that
              constitute a remarkable intellectual network among the leading scientists of
              the nineteenth century--and in the aggregate they give striking evidence of the
              how heavily Darwin relied upon correspondence to complete his research.  The
              Correspondence has a wide audience, including historians of science,
              biologists, geologists, philosophers, scholars of the nineteenth century, and
              general readers, for whom are brought together materials now widely dispersed
              among scattered repositories.
