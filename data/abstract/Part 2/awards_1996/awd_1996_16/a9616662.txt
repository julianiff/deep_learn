Abstract    :
              9616662  Heath    White whales endure oxygen deficits, extreme cold and
              pressure, and rapid changes in pressure when they perform repeated prolonged
              breathhold dives to greater than 1800 feet. This study will examine how these
              factors affect important body functions such as heartbeat, circulation and
              oxygen delivery to tissues. Of particular interest are specific adaptations
              that allow the whales to perform such dives repeatedly without incurring any
              harmful physiological side-effects.
