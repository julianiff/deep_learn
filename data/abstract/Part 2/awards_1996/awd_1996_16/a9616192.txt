Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9616192    Polymer blends are mostly prepared through melt-mixing.
               The compatibilization of the polymers occurs during melt-processing,
              especially via reactive extrusion.  In this proposal, an alternative approach
              to the formation and compatibilization is proposed; namely, the
              auto-compatibilization via concentrated emulsions.  In this method, two
              concentrated emulsions are prepared from different monomers and subjected to
              partial polymerization.  A blend is formed by mixing the partially polymerized
              cells instead of melts and subjecting the mixture to complete polymerization. 
              Some copolymers, block copolymers or network structures are generated during
              the latter polymerization near the surface of the cells, which achieve the
              "auto-compatibilization" of the resulting blend.    Two types of
              auto-concentration will be investigated.  (1)  The two concentrated emulsions
              do not contain di-vinyl-terminated macromonomers.               The
              compatibilization is achieved in this case by the formation of copolymers near
              the          surface of the cells.    (2)  The two concentrated emulsions
              contain di-vinyl-terminated macromonomers.  The         compatibilization is
              achieved in this case via the formation of compatibilizers with         network
              structures.    The most distinctive feature of the method is that the blended
              polymers and the compatibilization are generated simultaneously.
