Abstract    :
                PI:    Johnston  IBN:  9616303      In this proposal the PI seek support for
              an international  scientific conference, Chemical Signals in Vertebrates, that 
              meets every three years. This meeting is unique in that is  the only focusing
              on chemical communication in vertebrates,  and the only one that brings
              together scientists working at  all levels of analysis.  Disciplines
              represented include  chemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, neuroanatomy, 
              neurophysiology, psychology, animal behavior, and ecology.  It also brings
              together people who do not ordinarily meet  because of their focus on different
              types of organisms, such  as amphibians, fish, birds, and mammals.  Funds are 
              requested to support the travel of scientists from  economically stressed
              countries, particularly those of  Russia and eastern Europe.  Some funds are
              also proposed to  help graduate students attend the meeting
