Abstract    :
              This project will:  (1) develop new methods for studying the acceleration and
              transport of solar energetic particles based upon detailed analysis of particle
              angular distributions; (2) characterize and understand transient anisotropies
              accompanying cosmic ray transient variations; (3) develop new methods to
              determine the geometry of interplanetary magnetic turbulence based upon 
              measurements of magnetic field and charged particle fluctuations; (4) improve
              understanding of particle scattering by turbulence, ultimately aimed to achieve
              a useful predictive capability where particle mean free paths can be deduced
              from measurable properties of the turbulence; (5) evaluate the usefulness of
              cosmic rays as a space weather tool for remote sensing the properties of
              approaching solar wind disturbances; and (6) improve knowledge of geomagnetic
              cutoffs and charged particle motion in Earth's magnetosphere through detailed
              testing of model predictions against ground-based observations.
