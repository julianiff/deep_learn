Abstract    :
              This research is exploring the development of a very different approach to image
               coding based on representing an image by a large collection of statistics. 
              The  approach is motivated by the recognition that state-of-the-art wavelet
              image  coders owe their superior coding performance to more accurate
              statistical  modeling of coefficients.  The accuracy of these models is limited
              by the cost  in bitrate of transmitting the statistics needed to support the
              modeling.    Our approach makes more explicit use of model statistics to allow
              direct  representation of the image with those statistics.  The statistics
              serve both to  maximize the accuracy of the statistical modeling and to
              represent the image  itself.  Consequently, many more statistics can afford to
              be transmitted and  modeling accuracy is greatly improved.    The approach has
              shown very promising preliminary results, and promises to  substantially
              advance the state-of-the-art in image coding.  The approach also  suggests new
              opportunities for managing the perceptual quality of coding  algorithms through
              perceptually optimized quantization of the new representation.   These
              perceptual issues will also be investigated.
