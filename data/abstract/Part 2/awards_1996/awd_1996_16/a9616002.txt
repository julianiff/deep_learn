Abstract    :
                This three-year award to the Department of Education will  support the
              participation of a US consortium in an  innovative multicultural curriculum for
              young scientists and  engineers from the US and the European Union (EU).   The
              US  consortium is headed by the University of Texas at Austin,  and includes
              the University of Virginia at Charlottesville  and the Oklahoma State
              University at Stillwater.  Support of  this proposal will allow 18 US graduate
              and undergraduate  students to enroll in the seven institutions in the 
              counterpart European consortium supported by the European  Union and receive
              academic reciprocity and a double diploma,  and to participate in an industry
              internship.  The seven  institutions in the European consortium are headed by
              the  Ecole Central of Lille in France, and include the Free  University of
              Brussels and the Catholic University of  Louvain in Belgium, the University of
              Zaragoza in Spain, the  Technical University of Munich in Germany,  Brunel 
              University in the United Kingdom, and the Polytechnic  Institute of Milan in
              Italy.
