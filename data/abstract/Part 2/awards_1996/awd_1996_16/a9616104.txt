Abstract    :
                  9616104  Ort  Funding if for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to
              attend a Gordon Research Conference on "Temperature Stress in Plants", to be
              held January 26-31, 1997, at Ventura, California.  The program will bring
              together researchers who work on different sides of the temperature optimum for
              most higher plants, freezing stress and heat shock.  The objective of this
              conference is to bring together these two groups which have usually been
              separated although it has become obvious that there is common ground in the
              effects of temperature on biochemical and molecular processes.  The conference
              derives its main rationale from the conviction that the fields can profit which
              communication is improved.
