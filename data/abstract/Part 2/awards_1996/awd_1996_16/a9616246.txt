Abstract    :
              9616246  Ducharme  The purpose of this work is to explore the ferroelectric
              state, switching dynamics, and an unusual conductance switching phenomenon in
              ultrathin Langmuir-Blodget (LB) polymer films with thicknesses ranging from one
              to 100 or more monolayers.  These films have potential application to
              nonvolatile computer memory (or data caching or data storage), uncooled
              infrared imaging devices, nonlinear capacitors, pyroelectric sensors, or
              acoustic transducers, among other possibilities.    The proposed research has
              four interrelated components: 1) Investigation of Ferroelectric State
              properties such as the phase transition temperature, spontaneous polarization,
              Curie constant, and dielectric hysteresis. 2) Study of Low-Dimensional
              Ferroelectricity will be in films as thin as one monolayer.  3) Study of a
              novel conductance Switching phenomenon that intimately connected to bulk
              polarization switching.  4) Evaluation of Potential Applications uniquely
              suited to the LB ferroelectric polymers.  Measurement techniques will include
              switching charge and current, pyroelectric responqe, conductance, and
              dielectric response as functions of temperature, electric field, and thickness.
                 The results will provide unprecedented understanding of the ferroelectric
              state in polymers and in reduced-dimensionality systems and will reveal the
              salient features of the conductance switching phenomenon.  The results will
              also provide a critical foundation for potential application of these
              inexpensive but versatile electronic materials to computer and transducer
              technologies.  ***
