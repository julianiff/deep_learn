Abstract    :
                  This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's 
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial 
              support for two years for a DS-3 connection to the Very High Performance 
              Backbone Network Service (vBNS).  Applications include molecular dynamics 
              simulations; computational fluid dynamics; earth systems science; astronomy 
              and astrophysics, including real time control of the Hobby-Eberly telescope  in
              West Texas; surface chemistry with ion beams and lasers; and high  performance
              data sharing.  Collaborating institutions include Cornell  Theory Center,
              Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center, National Center for  Atmospheric Research and
              Arecibo Observatory.
