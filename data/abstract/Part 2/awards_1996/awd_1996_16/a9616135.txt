Abstract    :
                     Abstract      Proposal Number:  CTS 9616135  Principal Investigator: 
              Lin,  Clarkson      This is a grant to investigate in more detail the discovery
              that the onset of instability in a vertical film can be suppressed completely
              in certain discrete bandwidths of frequency and amplitude of plate oscillation.
               The physical mechanisms  remain unknown.  Linear and nonlinear stability
              theories of a liquid film flow down an oscillating inclined plane  are
              proposed.  Based on the numerical solution of the derived equations, the energy
              budget in wavy films and its spectral properties will be calculated to uncover
              the mechanism of suppression of instability.  Further insight into the control
              of wave interactions involving gravitational, surface tension and shear forces
              is of fundamental scientific significance, because the problem is a generic
              example of flow control.  The scientific knowledge to be gained from this study
              will be useful for a variety of applications including coating of photographic
              film or paper, protective layers such as insulation or anticorrosive material
              on high-tech surfaces, etc.  The ability to control stability will help make
              many coated products more reliable, safer and of higher quality.  It will also
              enable many coating processes to become more efficient, precise and material
              saving, and thus more environmentally friendly.
