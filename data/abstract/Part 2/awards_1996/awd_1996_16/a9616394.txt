Abstract    :
              This award is for support for three years of funding for a  project designed to
              answer two questions of critical importance  to understanding the ice flow of
              the West Antarctic ice sheet: 1)  Are the Ross ice streams  (B, D, and E)
              currently surging?, and  2) What has been the buttressing effect of an
              enlarging Crary Ice  Rise on the flow of ice stream B?  Both questions will be 
              answered based on a combination of data collected on the surface,  from the air
              and from space.  While many past indications  of  change in West Antarctica
              have been based on interpolations and  calculations with large uncertainties,
              these measurements will be  direct, making use of rapid and accurate GPS
              positioning to  minimize field logistic requirements.  Direct measurement of 
              expected thinning in the upper portion of ice stream D and  repeated satellite
              image measurements at the heads of ice streams  B, D, and E to detect the
              inland migration of the onset area (as  is required by sustained surging) will
              enable a test of a surge  hypothesis developed by Bindschadler.  The
              buttressing impact of  Crary Ice Rise on ice stream B's flow will be studied by
               comparing new measurements of ice thickness, surface elevation  and velocity
              with data collected during the 1950s, 1970s and  1980s, providing a
              multi-decadal time-series of change.
