Abstract    :
              9616072  Jacobsen    This grant provides $128,493 as partial salary support for
              a  technician responsible for oversight, maintenance and daily  operation of
              the thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS)  facility at Harvard
              University.  This is a Phase I technician  support grant under the EAR/IF
              technician support sub-program.  Establishment of this technical position at
              the Harvard TIMS lab  will provide needed instrumental oversight and
              maintenance (there  are 3 TIMS at Harvard) which will soon increase as the
              result of  Harvard's decision to add an additional faculty member and a 
              research associate, Roberta Rudnick and Paul Hoffman,  respectively, whose
              research requires the use of TIMS for  radiogenic isotopic analyses. Technical
              support will also greatly  facilitate the PI's research on a variety of topics
              including,  studies of the accretion and early history of the Earth based on 
              measurement of the Hafnium-Tungsten isotopic system using  negative ion TIMS
              (N-TIMS), studies of mantle geochemistry based  on Neodymium/Samarium and
              Rubidium/Strontium isotopic analyses of  Komatiites and high-MgO basalts,
              elemental analyses of the  Platinum group elements (PGE) in basalts using
              N-TIMS, U/Pb  geochronology as applied to lithospheric tectonics and use of Sr 
              isotopes to infer paleo-surface processes.  ***
