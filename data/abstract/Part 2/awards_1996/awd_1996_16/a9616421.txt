Abstract    :
              9616421  Booker    This award provides partial support for the acquisition of  
              portable magnetometers and associated field equipment by the  University of
              Washington that will become part of a centrally  managed pool of equipment and
              made available to US researchers for  field deployment in projects using the
              magnetotelluric (MT)  technique to image the Earth's deep interior structure.
              The  University of Washington is committed to providing the remaining  funds
              necessary to acquire the equipment system.    Remote sensing  of the Earth's
              crust and upper mantle using MT  methods recently has made significant progress
              in producing images  of internal structures with good spatial resolution and
              with  content (electrical conductivity) that is distinct from seismic  images
              (seismic velocities). The MT method makes use of the  time-dependent natural
              electromagnetic fields (EM) induced inside  the Earth by the variations of the
              Earth's external geomagnetic  field. The induced electric (telluric) currents
              diffuse into the  Earth and are scattered back from heterogeneities in the
              electrical  resistivity structure. The complex, frequency dependent, 
              relationship between the horizontal magnetic and electric fields at  the
              surface is called the MT impedance and can be inverted to solve  for the
              resistivity (or conductivity) structure of the interior.  Conductivity
              properties of the interior are of considerable  interest because they depend
              strongly on the presence of conducting  ionic fluids or melts which are
              difficult or impossible to detect  with other remote sensing techniques.  ***
