Abstract    :
              9616443  Crane   The paleobotanical collections of the field Museum are an
              important national and international resource for systematic plant biology.  In
              the past five years these collections have grown by over 7800 specimens (10%),
              and currently total approximately 77,800 specimens.  This collection is
              severely overcrowded in its current quarters, and many specimens cannot
              currently be accommodated within the collection space.  The Field Museum has
              recently constructed new collections space at a cost of $4.25 million; of this
              space 1,929 square feet (worth $240,000) have been dedicated to the
              paleobotanical collection.  The Field Museum is also providing graduate student
              and summer intern stipends to match the graduate student stipends and equipment
              funded by NSF.  The total cost of the project is $550,000, of which the Field
              Museum has or will carry 48%, in partnership with the NSF.  Once the project is
              complete, the paleobotanical collections will be moved into new compactorized
              storage near the neontological plant collections, have no backlog (as that will
              be integrated into the collections as part of the move), and a detailed
              description of the entire collection will be available on the World Wide Web. 
              This project will also benefit the Field Museum's other fossil collections, as
              they will be moved into space vacated by the paleobotanical specimens, thus
              alleviating overcrowding in vertebrate and invertebrate paleontology.
