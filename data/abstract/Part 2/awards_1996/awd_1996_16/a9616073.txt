Abstract    :
              9616073  Chandrasekaran    This funding is requested in order to permit
              attendance of up to  ten U.S. participants at the Ninth National Power System 
              Conference (NPSC) to be held during the December 19-21, 1996 at  the Indian
              Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India.  The U.S.  participants, along with
              some Indian researchers, will make  presentations at a Workshop on Artificial
              Intelligence Techniques  Applied in Electric Distribution Systems.  The primary
              purpose of  the U.S. participation is to share and exchange the latest 
              research ideas in various aspects such as planning, operation,  and control of
              distribution systems.  The participants will be  able to obtain useful data on
              research work in other theme areas  of the conference. Indian researchers have
              contributed heavily to  the proposed workshop theme area, and the U.S.
              contingent can  benefit from the visit by identifying fresh approaches to 
              handling the problems at home in the deregulated environment.   Major public
              and private sector power companies sponsor the  biennial conference held under
              the aegis of leading educational  institution such as the Indian Institute of
              Technology, Kanpur,  India.  The conference had been a major event in the power
              system  area, and attended by well over 400 scientist, engineers,  consultants,
              manufacturers, and utility personnel.  ***
