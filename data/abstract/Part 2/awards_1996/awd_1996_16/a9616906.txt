Abstract    :
              Passaic County Community College requests support from NSF to connect it's
              campus to the Internet.  The College is a publicly supported associate degree
              institution with a student body of 4000.  The College intends to connect to the
              Internet through Bell Atlantic, a local Internet service provider.  The campus
              needs the Internet connection to be able to access information resources
              throughout the state, the nation and the world.  The connection will benefit
              the faculty, staff students of this institution as well as the community in
              general.  The award provides partial support of the project for two years.
