              Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies:  An Automated Reading
              Assistant That Listens    Carnegie Mellon University will build a prototype to
              serve as a testbed for experimental in-school use by students and teachers. 
              The investigator will advance, adapt, and integrate methods from speech
              recognition, computational linguistics, cognitive and motivational psychology,
              machine learning, human computer interaction, and education.  Expected outcomes
              include implemented, evaluated methods to analyze oral reading, provide
              cognitively and motivationally effective response, and author interactive
              reading experiences.
