Abstract    :
              OCE 96-16017  Young    The project will consist of theoretical work in two
              general  areas: Investigation of the mixed layer temperature-salinity  (T-S)
              relationship and development of a description of near-  inertial wave
              propagation. The mixed layer T-S study will  concentrate on clarifying how two
              competing mechanisms for  the diffusive flux of T and S act on different
              horizontal  length scales. The theory developed in this part of the  study will
              be tested through the evaluation of field data to  be collected as part of
              another recently funded NSF project.  The near inertial wave propagation study
              will benefit from a  new approach with several distinct advantages over
              existing  theories.
