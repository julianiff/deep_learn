Abstract    :
                This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program,
              focusses on the synthesis of oligodeoxynucleotides that  have specific and
              stable electrochemical signals when immobilized  on an electrode surface. 
              Professor James Q. Chambers and his  students at the University of Tennessee
              will use mercuration and  coupling of quinones via phosphoramidite linking
              agents to impart  electroactivity to these oligodeoxynucleotides.  These
              immobilized  reagents will exhibit shifts in their electrochemical responses 
              upon exposure to DNA molecules with complementary base sequences  making a
              highly selective and sensitive biosensor for specific DNA  molecules. 
              Electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, quartz crystal  microbalance, and
              impedance spectroscopic measurements will be used  to characterize these
              biosensors.  Biosensors that can selectively and sensitively detect target DNA 
              molecules will be constructed and characterized in this work by  Professor
              Chambers and his students at the University of Tennessee.  
              Oligodeoxynucleotides will be modified to become electroactive so  that when
              they complex with target DNA on the surface of an  electrode, an
              electroanalytical current can be detected.  These  biosensors have extensive
              potential for application in the analysis  of polynucleotides with specific
              base sequences.
