Abstract    :
              9616267  Lott    The development, field testing, and evaluation of SIMMS
              (Systemic Initiative for Montana Mathematics and Science), a four-year
              secondary school mathematics curriculum, is being completed.  This curriculum
              integrates topics within mathematics, emphasizes the relation between
              mathematics and other disciplines, and makes extensive use of technology in
              laboratory based activities.  The emphasis for this phase of the development is
              on field testing, evaluation, and revisions, with special attention to testing
              the materials in urban settings.
