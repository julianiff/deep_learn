Abstract    :
              The Visual Programming Challenge (VPC) is a competition designed to test the
              effectiveness of visual/multimodal programming languages at programming certain
              problems.  The objective of the challenge is to focus research efforts on
              visual/multimodal programming approaches that offer the greatest potential of
              allowing `ordinary` people to `program` tasks.  One of the problems of
              unfocused research is that the emphasis tends towards novel, rather than
              effective.  The intent of the VPC is to promote research that leads to
              effective solutions.  The particular problem domain of the competition requires
              real-time control of an intelligent robot vehicle within an unknown system of
              roads composed of standard Lego road tiles.  The solution to this problem
              requires managing a representation for a 2D data structure (of unknown
              dimensions), constructing closures over dynamic data structures (to determine
              if all paths connect), planning (to find the best route to an incomplete path
              needing further exploration), and real-time control (many of the robot
              interactions must occur between specific operation states).  The results of
              visual/multimodal programming have already had an impact on a number of related
              fields, including scientific visualization and human-computer interfaces.  This
              impact will grow as emphasis is increased on bringing more people into daily
              use of computers for both business and personal interests.  This challenge
              serves to help focus research in visual/multimodal programming languages and
              thereby to improve the effectiveness of this technology for everyday use.
