Abstract    :
                            9616951    Yang    In this project, the PIs will address the poor
              state of model  representation of overflow processes from marginal seas into
              the  open ocean by implementing and improving a simple marginal-sea  model into
              the GFDL MOM.  Specifically, they plan to include a  contribution from
              wind-driven circulation to open ocean-marginal  sea exchange, and to allow a
              finite storage capacity of the  marginal sea.  Their previous work demonstrated
              that they can  couple a marginal sea model with a GCM.
