Abstract    :
              This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of 
              NCRI's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers 
              K-12 education institutions (including vocational technical schools),  public
              libraries and museums.  It provides partial support for two years  for a
              totally wireless system to connect a small museum to the Internet.  Wireless
              also will be used within the museum to connect a laptop equipped  with a camera
              to allow innovative ways for remote users to view the museum  displays.
