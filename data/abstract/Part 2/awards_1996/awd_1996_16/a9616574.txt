Abstract    :
              9616574  Singh  This mid-career PI has been successful in rejuvenating the 
              technique of high temperature series expansion in  statistical mechanics and
              has applied it to a wide variety  of problems in quantum magnetism. The new
              magnetic materials  in this study include, apart from the technologically 
              important high-temperature superconductors and colossal  magnetoresistance
              Perovskites; the inorganic spin-Peierls  CuGeO3  and quasi two dimensional spin
              gap materials CaV4O9.  In this grant the high temperature series expansion is 
              supplemented by zero temperature high order perturbation  expansion and exact
              diagonalization (especially the Kernel  Polynomial method) for finite lattices.
               The focus will be  to calculate the temperature dependent spectral properties 
              of the various quantum spin models, e.g. Heisenberg-Ising,  and their parent
              models of strongly correlated electrons  such as, Hubbard, t-J, Kondo-lattice
              and double exchange  models.  %%%  This mid-career PI has been applauded for
              revitalizing the  technique of high temperature series expansion in 
              statistical mechanics.  He has successfully applied this  technique to gather
              critical insight in the properties of  several novel magnets.  This grant is to
              support a  continuing growth of his research program which includes 
              consideration of additional, more complex techniques.  The  results will be
              compared to a variety of experiments.
