              supports partial conference expenses for speakers at a  workshop on "Galactic
              Halos", to be held on the UCSC campus  during 11-15 August, 1997. The workshop
              is useful because many  new observations-e.g., of MACHOs, of galactic rotations
              curves,  of X-ray emission around galaxies-indicate that our present ideas 
              about halos are too simple, and that halos interact with their  central
              galaxies to a greater extent than realized hitherto. A  clearer understanding
              of halos will improve our theories of  galactic formation and evolution.
