Abstract    :
                In recent years research in networking, distributed systems, and high
              performance computing has been hampered by the research community's limited
              access to high performance networking equipment, and more importantly, the
              detailed technical information needed to use it effectively in experimental
              systems research programs.    This project provides gigabit network technology
              to U.S. universities for use in research and education. This technology is
              distributed in the form of Gigabit Network Kits, each kit consisting of a high
              performance ATM switch (supporting link speeds of up to 2.4 Gb/s), six network
              interface cards for workstations or PCs, software (including source), extensive
              documentation, including hardware design information. The kits are designed to
              permit flexible use in a variety of different systems research contexts
              (networking, operating systems, multimedia and high performance computing), and
              can be modified at both the software and hardware levels.     In addition to
              the hardware and software, the program provides initial user training in the
              form of a two week intensive course and ongoing support through a users' group,
              an electronic mailing list and a WWW site providing access to software,
              documentation, announcements of contributed research products, bug reports and
              a FAQ page. Hardware support is also provided. The program also provides for a
              series of user workshops, (one every six months), allowing users to share
              experiences and demonstrate results from their work.
