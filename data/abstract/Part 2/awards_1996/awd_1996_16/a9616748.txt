Abstract    :
              9616748  Wittig    This research examines the massive phase transformations in 
              binary and ternary Ti-Al alloys to determine the parent to  product
              crystallographic relationships and the effects of  ternary elements on the
              nucleation and growth of the massive  transformation product.  The base alloy
              has a composition of  Ti-48at%Al.  To this stoichiometry, additions of the
              ternary  elements V, Nb, Cr, Mo, Mn, and Fe are added.  Initially the  work
              concentrates on the V, Cr, and Mn series from row four  of the periodic table. 
              By utilizing the University of  Vanderbilt's undercooling, rapid quench
              technology, unique  nonequilibrium microstructures are formed that should help 
              clarify present confusion regarding the site preferences of  ternary additions
              to gamma TiAl.  The rapidly cooled, splat-  quenched samples are analyzed using
              optical microscopy, X-  ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy  and 
              analytical electron microscopy.  By employing ALCHEMI to  compare the
              non-equilibrium microstructures of undercooled  and rapidly quenched TiAl
              ternary alloys with equilibrium  conditions, the site occupation of the ternary
              elements can  be characterized as a function of Ti/Al stoichiometry.  %%% 
              Knowledge of the influence of ternary atom additions on the  unit cell
              structure is critical to the understanding of the  atomic mechanisms
              responsible for improved  mechanical  properties observed in the Ti-Al 48at%
              ternary alloys.  The  high cooling rate, solid-state transformations explored
              in  this research give some insights onto other nonequilibrium  processes such
              as those found in the heat-affected zones of  welded alloys.  ***
