Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9616763    This is an examination of the use of resonance-enhanced
              multiphoton ionization spectroscopy in conjunction with time-of-flight mass
              spectrometry (REMPI/TOFMS) for continuous monitoring of incinerator stack gas
              emissions.  Detection limits for 28 compounds found in incinerator stack gases
              have been determined in earlier studies; in this study polychlorinated
              biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorinated polycyclic aromatics are added to this list. 
              Also pursued in this study are the establishment of reliable methods for direct
              sampling of semivolatile polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) and other
              combustion products and the development of calibration methods for absolute
              concentration measurements of stack-gas components.  Finally, the reliability
              of the method to function under simulated incinerator-upset conditions is
              evaluated.    The goal of this effort is to adapt a technique for chemical
              analysis that has been used in research studies of combustion for monitoring of
              stack gas emission from incinerators for purposes of incinerator control and
              environmental compliance.  A simple, real-time measurement of chemical species
              in stack emissions is needed to make waste incinerators acceptable
              environmentally and politically.  ***
