Abstract    :
              9616440  Rabalais    Ion Beam Deposition (IBD) will be used for the isotopic 
              structuring of thin films to explore fundamental issues in  diffusion and
              interfacial reactions in silicon.  Almost all  previous studies of silicon self
              diffusion have used indirect  methods to obtain experimental information. 
              Self-diffusion  mechanisms of interstitial and vacancy migration in silicon and
               group III nitrides will be studied, and the structural,  electrical, and
              optical properties of isotopically engineered  materials will be obtained. 
              %%%%  This information is of increasingly critical interest to silicon 
              microelectronics as the dimensional tolerances for fiberoptic and 
              optoelectronic device structures fabricated by ion implantation  or diffusion
              get ever smaller.  ***
