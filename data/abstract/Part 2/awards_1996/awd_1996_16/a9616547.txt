Abstract    :
              This project will continue theoretical studies and associated computer
              simulation and modeling of a range of basic solar wind properties and their
              interactions with cosmic rays.  The PI will study the structure of the
              interplanetary magnetic field and plasma, emphasizing the effect of the field's
              structure on cosmic ray and energetic particle acceleration, propagation and
              anisotropies.  In addition, the PI will observe the effect fluid flows such as
              the solar wind can help accelerate the solar wind near the sun.  This
              understanding can then be used to probe distant, unexplored regions of the
              solar wind using cosmic ray observations.
