Abstract    :
              9616950    Huang    In  this  project, the PI will examine the dynamic role  of 
              non-  uniform  diapycnal mixing in the oceanic circulation, using  both 
              theoretical and numerical approaches.  Principal focus will be on  the dynamic
              role of double diffusive processes in the maintenance  of   the   thermohaline 
               circulation  under   natural   boundary  conditions,  and  the  dynamic
              consequence of  bottom-intensified  mixing on the thermohaline overturning.
