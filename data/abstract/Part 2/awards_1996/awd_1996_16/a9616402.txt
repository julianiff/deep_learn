Abstract    :
                Surface vibrational spectroscopy, using reflection absorption  infrared
              methods, is the focus of this research project supported  by the Analytical and
              Surface Chemistry Program.  Professor  Trenary                              
              and his students at the  University of Illinois at Chicago will                
                                          determine the identity and structure of adsorbed 
              species  using vibrational spectroscopy.  Normal mode analysis  will be applied
              to the interpretation of this spectroscopic data,  enabling assignment of
              vibrational bands, and determination of  structural parameters for the adsorbed
              species.  The application  of these methods to the methoxy intermediate on
              copper surfaces,  and to isocyanide and related moieties on platinum surfaces
              are  the primary systems of interest.  The results of this work will  see broad
              application in the routine use of surface IR to  characterize reaction
              processes.  The use of surface infrared spectroscopy as a routine analytical 
              tool will be enabled by the development of normal mode analysis  methods which
              are the subject of this research project.  In order  to understand reaction
              processes on surfaces, adsorbed reactants,  products, and intermediates must be
              identified and structurally  characterized.  Normal mode methods will make this
               characterization routinely available to the surface chemistry  community.
