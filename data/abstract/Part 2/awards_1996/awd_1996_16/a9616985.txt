Abstract    :
                  The North Central Technical College requests support from NSF to connect
              it's campus to the Internet.  The North Central Technical College in Mansfield,
              OH has approximately 9,200 students and offers 52 degree and certificates in
              approximately 28 programs of study.  The college intends to connect through
              OARnet, a local Internet service provider.  The campus needs the Internet
              connection to be able to access information resources throughout the state, the
              nation and the world.  The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students
              of this institution as well as the community in general.  The award provides
              partial support of the project for two years.
