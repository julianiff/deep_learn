Abstract    :
              9616250  DOUGHERTY  PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV.    This award is to provide
              phase-out funding for the Industry University  Cooperative Research Center at
              the Pennsylvania State University  for  Dielectric Studies, and to fund the NSF
              Evaluator for the center.  The  center has been funded for twelve years, and is
              now phasing down NSF  support preparing to be self sufficient with industry
              support.  The core  research for the center includes synthesis and processing
              of dielectric  materials, capacitor dielectrics and reliability, microwave
              dielectrics,  packaging dielectrics, multilayer dielectrics, thin film
              dielectrics, high  temperature dielectrics, and relaxor dielectrics.  The
              center has twelve  industrial partners and others are anticipating joining. 
              The goal of the  center is to perform research that is highly relevant to the
              electronic  ceramics industry.  ***
