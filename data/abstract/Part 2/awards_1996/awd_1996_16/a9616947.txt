Abstract    :
              9616947  Gelhar  This is an award to provide support for research on the
              behavior  of dense, nonaqueous phase liquids when present in an aquifer  being
              considered for or being subjected to decontamination.  The  objectives of the
              project are to determine the role of aquifer  heterogeneity in field-scale flow
              of immiscible liquids, the  distribution of residual nonwetting liquids and the
              rate of  dissolution from the residual phase, and to develop strategies  for
              data collection and analysis during aquifer decontamination.  The research will
              involve a stochastic characterization in which  local scale behavior is assumed
              to be well represented by  conventional equations used to describe conservation
              of mass and  momentum.  The field-scale response will involve using linear 
              perturbation methods that relate the statistical description of  heterogeneity
              of soil properties to the observable field-scale  response.    The investigator
              plans on adapting techniques he has successfully  applied to understanding
              unsaturated flow in porous media while  also addressing additional factors that
              must be considered  including flow of a nonwetting phase, trapping by capillary
               forces and subsequent dissolution.  Addressing as it does the  effects that
              dense, nonaqueous liquids have on decontamination of  aquifers, one of the
              expected outcomes of this research will be  to improve the engineering design
              of aquifer decontamination  procedures.  However, results will also be
              applicable to a range  of environmental protection and resource development
              problems  that require prediction of field-scale transport processes such  as
              radioactive waste management and enhancement of petroleum  production.  ***
