Abstract    :
              .              9616344  Chow, Louis C.    ABSTRACT       This proposal deals
              with spray cooling for high heat flux applications.  The principal
              investigators propose to experimentally determine the relative importance of
              forced convection, nucleate boiling from surface cavities, and secondary
              nucleate boiling due to air/vapor nuclei entrapped by the impinging droplets. 
              A high-speed camera will be used in conjunction with a semi-transparent
              synthetic-diamond film to visualize the boiling process.  Relevant parameters
              such as the bubble density, growth rate, etc. will be determined for
              calculating the contribution of nucleate boiling in spray cooling.  The
              contribution of secondary nucleate boiling will be established by comparing the
              nucleation characteristics with that conducted with a submerged jet where
              secondary nucleation is absent.
