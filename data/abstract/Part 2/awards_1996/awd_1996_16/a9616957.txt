Abstract    :
              Abstract  EEC-9616957  Landers    This award provides funding for the first year
              of a five-year continuing award to support the basic research program of the
              Logistics Institute (TLI).  The Center was created in the fall of 1994 by the
              consolidation of the Material Handling Research Center (a joint I/UCRC between
              Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Arkansas), the Logistics
              Engineering Center (a research Center at Georgia Tech), and the former TLI (a
              continuing education Center at Georgia Tech).  TLI is currently a joint effort
              of Georgia Tech, the University of Arkansas, and 17 "Leaders in Logistics"
              companies.  The Center is involved in basic research, applied research,
              technology transfer, and continuing education.  The Center seeks to conduct
              research in following three areas: 1) Logistics networks; Logistics
              environments; and Logistics information and decision technology.
