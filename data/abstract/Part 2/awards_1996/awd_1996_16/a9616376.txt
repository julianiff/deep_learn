Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                       ABSTRACT    SBR 96-16376  PI: MacDonald    This
              proposal requests funds for a Special Session of the 10th  Annual CUNY
              Conference on Human Sentence Processing on the topic  of The Link between Child
              Language Acquisition and Adult Language  Comprehension. The CUNY Conference is
              the primary research  meeting of psychologists, linguists, and computer
              scientists who  study how humans comprehend language.  The special session is 
              necessary because researchers who study human adult language  comprehension
              typically have not taken advantage of work  indicating how children learn
              language.  There is now good  evidence that the way in which language is
              learned in childhood  affects the way in which it is represented and
              comprehended  in adults, and so the time is ripe for presentations at the CUNY 
              meeting.  In addition to offering important insights into the  nature of human
              capacities for learning and language, a better  understanding of language
              comprehension in humans may have  important practical applications to computer
              language  comprehension systems, as well as possible clinical applications 
              with children or adults with language disabilities.
