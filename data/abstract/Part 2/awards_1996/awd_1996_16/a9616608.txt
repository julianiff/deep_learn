Abstract    :
                9616608 Sardar  This is a project at an RUI institution to continue a
              successful program which provides undergraduate students with research
              experience in laser spectroscopy.  Students are actively involved in the study
              of optical properties of rare earth ions doped in crystalline host materials,
              and novel organic dyes in solid plastic materials.  Measurements include
              time-resolved spectroscopic techniques to study energy transfer characteristics
              and mechanisms.  Processes such as energy transfer between sensitizers and
              activators, fluorescence quenching, Stoke's shifts, and the effect of host
              materials on such processes are studied.  The research aims to help students
              understand and solidify their thinking about energy levels, selection rules,
              radiative and nonradiative processes.  Students actively participate in weekly
              group discussions interacting with fellow students and the PI. %%% The project
              is primarily oriented toward providing research education experience for
              undergraduates in materials physics studies including advanced characterization
              tools and analysis methods to address basic research issues in a topical area
              of high technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials
              science knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of processing and
              fabricating photonic devices such as lasers and sensors. An important feature
              of the program is the way in which research and education are integrated
              through the training of students in basic research in a fundamentally and
              technologically significant area. ***
