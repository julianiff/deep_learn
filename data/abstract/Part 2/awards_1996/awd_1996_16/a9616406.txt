Abstract    :
              9616406  Roman  The University of Maryland, Horn Point Laboratory will continue
              the   scientific planning and management activities of the Coastal Ocean  
              Processes (CoOP) research initiative. The CoOP program seeks to   promote
              interdisciplinary research in the coastal ocean.  Its   goal is to obtain a new
              level of quantitative understanding of   the transports, transformations and
              fates of biologically,   chemically, and geologically important matter over the
                continental margins.  CoOP planning is being undertaken by a group   of
              scientists dedicated to organizing large scale efforts in   interdisciplinary
              coastal ocean basic research. Through a series of   workshops and the
              deliberations of a scientific planning committee,   activities are undertaken
              to define the actual process studies and   long-term measurements to be made.
