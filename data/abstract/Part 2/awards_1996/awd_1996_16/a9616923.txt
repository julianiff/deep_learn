Abstract    :
                  Bradford College requests support from NSF to connect it's campus to the
              Internet.  Bradford College in Bradford, MD has approximately 620 students and
              35 full time faculty.  The college intends to connect through SprintLink, an
              Internet service  provider.  The campus needs the Internet connection to be
              able to access information resources throughout the state, the nation and the
              world.  The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of this
              institution as well as the community in general.  The award provides partial
              support of the project for two years.
