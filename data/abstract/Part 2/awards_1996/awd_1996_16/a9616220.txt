Abstract    :
                  Abstract  EEC-9616220  Zuckerman    The Center for Health Management
              Research was designated as an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
              by the National Science Foundation in July 1992.    The initial goals of the
              Center for Health Management Research were:  1) to develop a research agenda in
              collaboration with corporate members; 2) to undertake research, development,
              and evaluation projects on behalf of the corporate members; 3)to disseminate to
              the members findings of health services research; 4) to identify and
              disseminate to the members successful innovations and management practices from
              other health care organizations; and 5) to identify and disseminate to the
              members relevant research findings successful innovations and management
              practices from other industries and countries.    The vision of the Center
              continues to be refined in order to support its corporate members as they seek
              to adapt to a complex, challenging, and turbulent environment.    This award
              provides funding to expand the Center for Health Management Research. 
              Continuing discussion with NSF, researchers from Northwestern University, and a
              number of noteworthy health care organizations has led to a decision to join
              the Northwestern-based group to the Center for Health Management  and become an
              affiliated research site, governed by a single Industry Advisory Board.     
              The resultant Center for Health Management Research would substantially
              increase its complement of corporate members and its attendant financial
              support base.  The influence of the research would likely be enhanced through
              this larger base, our academic colleagues gain access to a larger set of
              high-quality organizations, and corporate members have a larger set of
              colleagues with whom to share experiences and learnings.
