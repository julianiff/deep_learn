Abstract    :
              Abstract  9616251  Fraser-Smith  This project operates an extremely low
              frequency and very low frequency (ELF/VLF) radiometer at McMurdo, Antarctica to
              monitor radio noise from natural sources such as thunderstorms.  It is one of a
              network of eight such radiometers which is operated by Stanford University for
              the Office of Naval Research.  It is important for operational purposes to
              characterize the possible sources of radio interference.  Additionally, the
              variations in global noise, reflects variations in global thunderstorm activity
              and can therefore provide information on global climate change.  The site where
              the radiometer is located in Antarctica was chosen about 15 years ago because
              it is unusually free from man-made electromagnet interference.  The ELF/VLF
              record now extends unbroken for more than 10 years.  ***
