Abstract    :
              9616864  Jaeger  This award provides support for innovative approaches to 
              improving the educational experience of students attending  the 1997 IEEE/EMBS
              (Engineering in Medicine and Biology  Society) conference (Chicago, Illinois,
              October 30-November  2, 1997), and to encourage students to participate more 
              fully in professional societies after graduation.  The  innovations will be
              applied to the Pre-Conference Workshops  and three Special Student
              Mini-Symposia.  It is hoped that  this technique will serve as a model for
              other professional  societies seeking to increase student involvement in their 
              proceedings.    In past conferences there has been poor attendance by  students
              at the Pre-Conference Workshops, primarily due to  the additional registration
              costs.  Funds from this award  would be used to support 80% of the registration
              fees for 50  students, who would pay 20% of the fee.  The criteria by  which
              the applications are to be judged are:  evidence of  the student's commitment
              to engineering and medicine, the  extent that the student is involved in a
              research project  related to the workshop requested, evidence that the student 
              will take a position in a company and will work in an area  related to the
              workshop requested, and evidence that the  student's academic program of study
              would be complemented by  attending the workshop requested.    Mini-Symposia in
              past EMBS meetings have largely been  tutorials on topics of general interest
              to practicing  biomedical engineers.  This award provides support for three 
              Mini-Symposia specifically directed to the needs of students  who are about to
              move to the workplace from a formal  educational experience.    The
              effectiveness of the innovations is to be documented by  the PI from the
              preparation of a statistical summary of  student participation and an analysis
              of the evaluation  questionnaires to be completed by the student participants.
