Abstract    :
              9616611  Kozma, Robert  SRI International    CISE/EHR/ENG/MPS Collaborative
              Research on Learning Technologies: Building Virtual Places for Collaborative
              Simulations: A Heterogeneous Network Architecture to Support Distant Learning  
               SRI International has been awarded $599,947 over 25 months for an effort to
              study collaborative learning within two learning communities: undergraduate
              chemistry students and science teachers involved in professional development. 
              The results of the research will be used to design and develop a network-based
              learning environment that supports a range of asynchronous and synchronous
              collaborative interaction among distributed teams on heterogeneous platforms. 
              The project will involve collaborations between social scientists studying
              social and task environments in learning, and computer scientists developing
              collaboration technologies that will support these environments.
