Abstract    :
                  This award is made under the high performance connections portion.  It
              provides partial support for an OC-3 connection to the Very High Performance
              Backbone Network Service (vBNS) via the Virginia Broadband Education Network
              (VBEN).With this high performance network capability the University of Virginia
              will support the Legion project.  The objective of Legion is to create a
              wide-area virtual computing environment for  researchers that transparently
              accesses data and computational resources across the country. On this project,
              collaborating institutions include:    San Diego Supercomputing Center   
              California Institute of Technology    Old Dominion University    Virginia Tech 
              The award provides partial support of the project for two years.
