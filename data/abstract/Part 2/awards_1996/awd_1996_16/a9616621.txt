Abstract    :
              9616621  Rosenberg  The Recent mollusk collection of the Academy of Natural
              Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP) is the oldest mollusk collection in the
              country, and the second largest catalogued one in the world. It currently has
              more than 430,000 catalogued lots containing about 12 million specimens. Many
              of the land and freshwater specimens represent species now threatened,
              endangered or extinct. To further increase the scientific value of the
              collection, this project will computerize the label and catalog data of those
              specimens collected in the United States. Computerization has obvious benefits
              for scientists studying systematics, evolution and biogeography, but there are
              also broad benefits for environmental sciences. Computerization of the
              collections will help in determining changes in the historical distribution
              patterns of mollusk species. Little such information is currently available,
              but is needed not only by scientists conducting basic systematic and ecological
              research on mollusks, but to provide baseline data for monitoring the health of
              ecosystems.  This project is funded by a partnership between the NSF and the
              Biological Resources Division of the USGS, and will contribute to the
              Integrated Taxonomic Information System.
