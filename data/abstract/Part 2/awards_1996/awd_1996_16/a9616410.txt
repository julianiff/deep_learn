Abstract    :
              9616410  Carraher, David  TERC, Inc.    CISE/EHR/ENG/MPS Collaborative Research
              on Learning Technologies:  Visualization Research Center    TERC, Inc. has been
              awarded $50,000 for a 6-month period to plan a research Center for the study of
              scientific and mathematical visualization.  The goals of the center are: (1) to
              undertake interdisciplinary empirical research on the technological development
              and cognitive interpretation of visualization technologies; and , (2) to
              improve K-12 math and science education by creating innovative visual
              curricular tools and (3) to contribute toward a new conceptual framework on the
              role of visualization in learning and understanding mathematics and science. 
              To promote a broad understanding of visualization as historically, culturally,
              and psychologically grounded, the Visualization Research Center will draw upon
              expertise not only from the natural and mathematical sciences but also from the
              humanities and social sciences.  Partnerships are being established with the
              National Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Massachusetts Institute of
              Technology Media Lab, the CalSpace at University of California-San Diego,
              Pennsylvania State University, the Boston University Medical Center Hospital,
              and the  Cranbrook Institute, among others.
