Abstract    :
              9616436  Woolf, Beverly Park  University of Massachusetts, Amherst   
              CISE/EHR/ENG/MPS Collaborative Research On Learning Technologies Program:  A
              Center for Intelligent Multimedia Instructional Systems    The University of
              Massachusetts, Amherst has been awarded funding in the amount of $50,000 for 12
              months to plan a Center for Intelligent, Multimedia Tutoring Systems (IMTS) for
              science, mathematics, engineering and technology education in higher education
              and for life-long learning.  ITMSs combine the power of visualization and
              animation with the student modeling capabilities of intelligent tutors to
              produce interactive learning environments that are highly effective for
              conveying complex, dynamic processes.    The Center plan will incorporate
              studies of many existing ITMSs, including a number of systems developed at the
              University of Massachusetts.  This particular corpus of work, combined with new
              systems that the University has pledged to develop, provides both an
              accumulated body of experience in IMTS development and an opportunity to submit
              many of them to the kind of laboratory analysis that will offer new educational
              insights into their effectiveness.
