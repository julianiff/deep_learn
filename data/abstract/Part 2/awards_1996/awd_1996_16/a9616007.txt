Abstract    :
               Lessons already learned under an existing award (NCR9527664) entitled  
              "Wireless Field Test Project" will be applied to implement wireless  
              communications between the Internet node and seven research institutions in  
              Mongolia's capital, Ulaanbaatar.  The wireless links are needed to support  
              U.S.-Mongolian research collaborations because the legacy Soviet era  
              telephone infrastructure in Ulaanbaatar is not adequate for supporting the  
              needed Internet applications.  In addition to providing needed Internet  
              connectivity between U.S. and Mongolian researchers, this project will test  
              the wireless systems in a harsher physical environment than is experienced   in
              the current NSF wireless project.  It will also test the ability of a  
              technically competent, but culturally and physically remote local team to  
              maintain and operate the equipment.  This will provide valuable insight for  
              future Internet extensions to other remote areas that have priority for   U.S.
              research activities.
