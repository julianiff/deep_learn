Abstract    :
                  CMS 9616626  Lee    This award provides funding for the Information Service
              at  the National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research  located at the
              State University of New York at Buffalo.  The Information Service offers
              traditional and non-  traditional access to information in earthquake
              engineering,  seismology, and the socioeconomic sciences.  In the ten  years
              since it was established, the Center's Information  Service has become an
              important contributor to the National  Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program as
              well as a major  provider of information to the worldwide community of 
              researchers and practitioners in earthquake hazard  mitigation.
