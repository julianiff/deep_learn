Abstract    :
              The Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science requests support from NSF to
              connect it's campus to the Internet.  The College provides health science
              education and research with a student population over 2,000 graduate and
              undergraduate students.  The College intends to connect to the Internet through
              the Health Sciences Libraries Consortium, a local nonprofit Internet service
              provider.  The campus needs the Internet connection to be able to access
              information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world.  The
              connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of this institution as well
              as the community in general.  The award provides partial support of the project
              for two years.
