Abstract    :
              9616255  Geil    Research over the last several years suggests that the 
              confined thin film melt polymerization (CTFMP) technique is  of general
              applicability for the growth of lamellar single  crystals of condensation
              polymers, liquid crystalline (LCPs)  and flexible polymers that are near ideal
              for electron  diffraction (ED) studies of crystal structure.They are  generally
              on the order of 100   thick, extended chain in  nature, with the molecular axes
              normal to the lamellae.  The  research under this grant has the goal of
              exploiting CTFMP  and related sample preparation techniques, utilizing ED and 
              a number of supplemental techniqes, in a number of areas of  significant
              interest including liquid-crystalline polymers,  crystal-to-mesophase
              transitions, and crystal structure  detepminations.  %%%%  This research will
              help to provide the underlying knowledge  of the structure and phase
              transitions of important  polymeric materials.  ***
