Abstract    :
              Abstract  9616664  Papen  This project will continue the operation of a sodium
              resonance lidar at the South Pole in order to study the vertical structure and
              dynamics of the atmosphere from the lower stratosphere to the mesopause. 
              During the third year of the project, an iron resonance lidar will be added
              which will extend the measurements of the dynamics and temperature structure to
              100 km altitude.  Additionally, an airglow imaging camera will be used to study
              the horizontal structure.  When used in conjunction with the normal
              balloon-borne radio sondes which are regularly flown from South Pole, the final
              complement of instruments will provide extensive data on the temperature
              structure from the surface to 100 km altitude; the nature of the polar
              stratospheric clouds, which are important to ozone chemistry;  the variability
              and frequency of occurrence of metallic layers in the mesosphere, which play a
              role in communications as well as chemistry; atmospheric gravity waves; and
              many other phenomena, some of which are unique to the South Pole.  ***
