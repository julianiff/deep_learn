Abstract    :
              9616245  Blidberg  Autonomous underwater vehicle  (AUV) technology has matured 
              to the point where it offers ocean scientists a solution to  the data
              collection problem:  intelligent autonomous mobile  platforms.  In order to
              realize the full potential of such  sensor platforms, however, some basic AUV
              research and  development must be undertaken.    This project is designed to
              address a fundamental "dual"  need currently experienced by AUV researchers. 
              One aspect  of that need can be expressed as the lack of an underlying 
              description of the behaviors necessary for intelligent  mobile autonomy.  The
              other aspect of this need is the lack  of a good implementation environment for
              candidates to this  set of behaviors for autonomy.  The goal of this project is
               to develop that description, and to develop a set of tools  with which to
              evaluate the description.  There are,  therefore, two objectives to pursue: (1)
              answer the question  "what are the required behaviors for a truly autonomous 
              underwater mobile agent?" and (2) develop the tools  necessary to validate
              candidate behavior sets.  ***
