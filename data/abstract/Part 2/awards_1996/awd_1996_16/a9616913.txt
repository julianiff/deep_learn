Abstract    :
              9616913  Duennebier         A Seismic swarm at Loihi seamount detected by the US
               Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcano Observatory seismic array began  on 16 July
              1996 and, at this time, over 2000 earthquakes have bee  recorded. This is the
              most intense swarm of earthquakes ever  recorded from any Hawaiian volcano.
              Anticipating that this swarm    is accompanied by volcanic activity, this
              project will use the  University of Hawaii research vessel KOK and Pisces
              submersible.  the bathymetry of the seamount will be resurveyed, the water over
               the seamount will be sampled to locate any eruptive activity, and,  if safety
              considerations allow, rock samples obtained.
