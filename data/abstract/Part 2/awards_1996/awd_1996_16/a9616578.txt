Abstract    :
              9616578  Hager  This grant provides funding for a conference on optimal control
              theory, applications, and  algorithms. Hosted by the Center for Applied
              Optimization at the University of Florida, this  conference will bring together
              leading researchers working on many different aspects of  optimal control and
              on diverse applications in areas such as aerospace engineering, 
              superconductors, robotics, medicine, thin films, and manufacturing. It will
              also provide a  unique opportunity for cross-disciplinary exchange of research.
              The conference has  received endorsements from the Mathematical Programming
              Society and is organized in  cooperation with Working Group T7C of the
              International Federation for Information  Processing.    Problems of
              optimization and optimal control are pervasive in modern life, occurring in 
              applications areas as diverse as steel manufacturing, robotics, flight control,
              design of  materials, film deposition processes, and plasmas, to name just a
              few.  This conference  will provide a forum for researchers working on
              different aspects of optimal control to  present their recent discoveries and
              to interact with individuals working on complementary  aspects of the subject. 
              Papers presented at this conference will represent the state-of-the-  art in
              optimal control theory and algorithm development. These papers will be placed
              in the  public domain by the publication of special issues of refereed
              scholarly journals.  ***
