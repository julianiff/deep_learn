Abstract    :
                     9616895 Mullen  This award provides support for a conference, "Finite
              Fields: Theory,  Applications, and Algorithms", to be held at the University of
              Waterloo in  August 1997. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of
              research in finite fields due to the wide variety of applications of various
              theoretical aspects of finite fields. Many exciting new theoretical results
              have been obtained by a  growing number of researchers worldwide, and many new
              applications have been  discovered. The purpose of this conference is to
              encourage interaction among different groups of researchers, both theoretical
              and applied. The organizing committee of the meeting consists of R. Mullin, I.
              Blake, S. Cohen, G. Mullen, H. Niederreiter, C. Stewart, and S. Vanstone. Funds
              from this award will be used to support U.S. graduate students, postdocs, and
              junior faculty members who attend the conference.  The theory of finite fields
              can be traced back to Gauss and Galois. Finite  fields have played central
              roles in research in number theory and algebraic geometry. In the last few
              decades, it has become an indispensable tool in  diverse applications in areas
              such as coding theory and cryptography. Coding  theory enables the error-free
              transmission of data, and is used, for example, in compact disks and computer
              drives. Cryptography is essential for the secure transmission of data.
