Abstract    :

              What Everyone Should Know About Information Technology, NAS, CSTB    A
              broad-based study designed to outline the body of knowledge about information
              technology that a person with a high school or college education should know is
              being conducted by the Computer Science and Technology Board (CSTB).  The study
              involves engaging a large community of organizations including the AAAS,
              accreditation organizations, school administrative groups, career counseling
              groups, and other appropriate organizations and is expected to provide the
              basis for formulating appropriate curricula and materials.  It is being carried
              out under the direction of an eight-member steering committee and includes
              extensive Internet-based input, a two or three day workshop and a two-stage
              review process on the report and recommendations of the workshop, which will
              then be widely distributed.
