Abstract    :
              The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Andreas Albrecht of  
              Cornell University in his continuing studies on the use of `noisy` light   to
              achieve femtosecond scale time resolution in condensed phase   spectroscopy
              using nanosecond pulses.  The noisy light-based timing is   formally
              generalized to nonlinear spectroscopies using a new diagrammatic   technique. 
              Focus is on second and third order nonlinear electrical   susceptibilities. 
              Two-dimensional array detection of the noisy light   interferograms will be
              incorporated to shorten data acquisition by nearly   two orders of magnitude.  
              These new spectroscopic techniques will potentially lead to more accurate  
              measurements of vibrational frequencies and shed light on relaxation  
              processes and coherence transfer in polyatomic molecules in condensed   phases.
               The very practical advantage of this technique is that noisy   light spectra
              in the nanosecond time domain can probe dynamics   approaching the femtosecond
              regime, without the need for (expensive)   coherent femtosecond pulses.
