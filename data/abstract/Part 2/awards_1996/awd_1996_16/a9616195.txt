Abstract    :
              9616195  Suppes  Donor organs used for heart, liver, kidney, or other 
              transplants have severely limited storage times.  Typically,  the operation
              must be performed within 24 to 48 hours for  the best opportunity of success. 
              The proposed research will  perform fundamental research which could directly
              lead to a  method for successfully storing or even freezing these donor  organs
              at lower temperatures without loosing organ viability  for transplants.  These
              new storage methods would be a  direct result of fundamental data of the impact
              of high  pressure on tissue.    The proposed research will investigate the
              impact of high  pressures, rates of pressure changes, thermally induced 
              freezing, and pressure induced freezing on the viability of  red blood cells
              and bovine sperm.  The proposed program  should be considered as a Small Grant
              for Exploratory  Research since little if any cryobiology has been performed 
              at the proposed high pressures.  The proposed funding is  sufficient to
              determine if further investigation is  warranted.  ***
