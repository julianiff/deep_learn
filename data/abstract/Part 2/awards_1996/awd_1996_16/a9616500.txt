Abstract    :
              9616500  Ewing, R.  Stiller, Peter  Texas A&M University    Collaborative
              Research On Learning Technologies:  A Center for Collaborative Research in
              Learning Technologies - Planning Proposal     Texas A&M University has been
              awarded  $50,000 for a period of 08 months to provide support for planning  to
              develop a proposal for a Center for Collaborative Research on Learning
              Technologies (CRLT) at Texas A&M.  The Center would serve as a major focal
              point for on-going research projects, and would provide leadership and
              administrative support for large scale collaborative projects involving
              interdisciplinary teams of researchers and participants from a multiplicity of
              locations and backgrounds.  The Center would also provide for the dissemination
              of research and newly developed technologies, and serve as a link to the
              telecommunications and other related hi-tech industries, working actively with
              private industry to commercialize successful technologies for their
              introduction into the classroom of the 21st century.
