Abstract    :
              9616145  Leasure    Computers and software are often proposed as a solution for
              weakness in science  and mathematics education in K-12, but without a
              theoretical and experimental basis for the application of technology, funds may
              be mis-spent and education weakened. Unfortunately, the body of theoretical and
              experimental results is difficult to apprehend due to its cross-disciplinary
              nature, small publication base, rapidity of change, overburden of
              market-motivated and anecdotal results, and cost of experimentation.    This
              project gains access to the most relevant research to explore alternatives for
              the computer-based   realization of the situational mathematics process, a
              learning approach used to improve mathematics education among the predominantly
              Hispanic 6-12 grade students of South Texas. The use of funds will allow
              visitation to leading-edge research sites, visits by other leading researchers
              to the university, and funds to purchase equipment and software for
              technological  exploration. The use of project funds will be guided by an
              oversight committee made up of the leading researchers in mathematics
              education.  ***
