Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9616291    Principal Investigator: Robert York    Abstract:
                    This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) for the development
              of a compact and tunable sub-millimeter radiation source using integrated
              photomixing on low temperature grown (LTG) compound semiconductors. The SGER
              will be used to demonstrate the potential for efficient microwave/millimeter
              wave signal generation and to investigate the limitations of LTG materials for
              photomixing, an area of risk which makes this work appropriate for SGER
              funding.  The source technologies developed within this research could lead to
              a simple compact and cost-effective implementation for broadband spectroscopy
              with many applications: environmental science, remote sensing, detection of
              hazardous chemicals and deep space exploration.
