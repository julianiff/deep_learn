Abstract    :
              9616669  Barnett  Recent advances in fire science and computer modeling of 
              fires allow scientists to predict fire growth and spread  through buildings and
              other structures.  To date, little  work has been done to develop the
              scientific basis for the  methodologies and techniques necessary to allow the
              use of  this technology for manual building-fire suppression.    The objective
              of this study is to develop a prototype system  consisting of a
              building-specific fire simulation database  and real-time sensor queries to aid
              fire fighting efforts in  building fires.  The database will be constructed by
              using  building fire field models based on computational fluid  dynamics theory
              and zone models as appropriate.  The result  of this work will be a system
              whereby manual fire  suppression activities will be optimized by an interaction
               with a building's thermal sensing system through the use of  computer database
              and visualization technology.    The results of this research will have
              wide-ranging  applications and will form the basis for the development of  new
              fire models and expert systems for building manual fire  suppression
              activities.  ***
