Abstract    :
              9616513  Narayanan, Hari N.  Auburn University    Rethinking Algorithmic
              Animations:  A  Novel Approach to Designing Program Visualizations for
              Learning.    There is general belief that visualizations significantly aid
              comprehension, and that animations are effective in conveying dynamic
              information.  In the domain of software, this belief is reflected in the
              popular use of animations to help students learn algorithms.  Recent research,
              though, may point to the fact that algorithmic animations are not as effective
              as assumed.  This project will apply results from research on how humans and
              computers reason with diagrams of mechanical devices to the design of
              visualization and animations of algorithms and explore basic questions to frame
              a longer term research project.
