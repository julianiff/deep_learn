Abstract    :
              9616773  Sadler    This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research proposal for a
              pilot study of the relationship between high school courses in physics and
              success in college level physics courses.  Preliminary work was `egun on a
              study of that subject in a few area colleges.  However, the investigator
              proposes to study the relationships that might be made from existing study
              sources such as the NELS:88 survey of 8th grade students in 1988 who have been
              followed up until they reached college in 1993.  The investigator also suggests
              that he will analyze data from the new study of international comparisons which
              has a sample of high school physics courses.
