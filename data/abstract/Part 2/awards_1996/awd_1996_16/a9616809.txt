Abstract    :
                                        Abstract  9616809  Mende  This award provides support
              to continue to operate and  analyze the data from an advanced dual-wavelength 
              intensified CCD all sky camera at South Pole for the purpose  of better
              understanding the aurora and Earth's  magnetosphere.  The camera is
              substantially identical to  those which the proposer has installed in the
              Automatic  Geophysical Observatory (AGO) array which is being deployed  over a
              very large area of the very high magnetic latitude  portion of the East
              Antarctic ice sheet.  The South Pole  instrument is an important component of
              the overall coverage  of the Antarctic upper atmosphere.  The nearly complete 
              coverage of  the magnetic polar cap afforded by the AGO-  South Pole system of
              imagers is especially valuable now  because it complements the imaging
              capabilities of the  recently launched POLAR satellite of the International
              Solar  Terrestrial Physics Program (ISTP).  ***
