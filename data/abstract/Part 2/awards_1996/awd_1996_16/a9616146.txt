Abstract    :
                      This proposal is to participate in the North GRIP or NGRIP (North
              Greenland Icesheet Project) deep-core project in North Central Greenland.  This
              effort is begin led by the Danes with participation from scientists from about
              six other nations.  If funded, the  U.S. contribution will be in measurements
              of mineralogical and radiogenic-isotope characteristics of dusts to determine
              their provenance (this proposal), and in measuring and interpreting stable
              isotopes (James White, U. Colorado).  The principal purpose in drilling this
              core, as stated by the Danes, was to recover a reliable record of the Eemian
              from Greenland ice.  There is much to be learned beyond this task, however, and
              much to be gained from this core regardless of the success in recovering an
              undisturbed Eemian section.    This project objectives are:    - using
              mineralogical and Sr-, Nd- and Pb-isotope compositions, to determine the source
              areas of the atmospheric dusts that have been deposited at NGRIP over the
              period recorded by the ice core -- hopefully including the Eemian -- thus
              providing constraints for models of paleoatmospheric circulation and transport
              from the dust source areas to the NGRIP part of Greenland.   - to compare these
              dust source areas recorded at NGRIP to those recorded at the same times in the
              dusts at Summit (GISP2, GRIP), and other possible Greenland core sites (e.g.,
              Dye 3), and thus begin to discern degrees of local (Greenland) variability in
              transport pathways, further constraining circulation models;   - if undisturbed
              Eemian ice is recovered at NGRIP, to specifically compare dusts from that ice
              to the putative Eemian ice, with any significant variations, at GRIP.
