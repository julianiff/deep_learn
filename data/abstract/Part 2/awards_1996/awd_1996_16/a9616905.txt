Abstract    :
              This award adds three higher education connections to the MOREnet state network.
               They are remote educational sites of Columbia College:  Fort Leonard Wood,
              Rolla and Saint Louis.  Faculty and students at the sites benefit from access
              to the resources of the Internet, including libraries and supercomputers.  In
              addition, they are able to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other
              campuses in pursuit of research and educational projects.  The award provides
              partial support of the project for two years.
