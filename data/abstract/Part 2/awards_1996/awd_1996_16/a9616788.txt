Abstract    :
              9616788  Gross    The myriad changes in the electric power industry are bring
              about  very major changes in every aspect of the industry.  The recent 
              legislative and regulatory initiatives are providing further  pressures for
              accelerating these changes.  These are resulting in  the disintegration of the
              heavily entrenched vertically  integrated structure.  With the release of the
              Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission Orders 888 and 889, a foundation for the 
              rules of the road of the new regime has been established.  This  workshop will
              focus on the technical and engineering issues  associated with the
              restructuring of the industry. The Workshop  will provide a forum for some of
              the leading electric power  system experts to exchange views and develop a
              compendium of  research needs and draft the blueprint for research directions. 
               The Proceedings of prepared presentations, papers and discussions  and the
              summarized recommendations will provide a conference  record that will be
              disseminated to the power research community  at large.  ***
