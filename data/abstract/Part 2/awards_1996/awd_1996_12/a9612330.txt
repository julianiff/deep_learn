Abstract    :
              9612330  Banerjee   This grant provided partial support for a symposium on
              virtual reality in manufacturing research and education.  Virtual reality, and
              ability to simulate real-world situations, is playing an increasingly important
              role in engineering and engineering education.  Improving computational
              capabilities will accelerate this trend.  This symposium will focus on the
              following topicq: computational aspect of virtual reality in manufacturing, the
              current state of software technologies, the current state of hardware
              technologies, distribution and logistics in manufacturing, layout and location
              problems in manufacturing education, manufacturing process design, product
              design and prototyping, telepresence and telerobotics, and volumetric
              visualization.  Results of the symposium will be made public by posting them on
              the World Wide Web and through a special issue of the Institute Engineering
              Transactions on Virtual Manufacturing.   This symposium help to accelerate the
              development of virtual reality technologies and improve the quality of
              engineering education.  This would contribute to the economic competitiveness
              of American industry.
