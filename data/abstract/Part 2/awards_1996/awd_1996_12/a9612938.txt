Abstract    :
              This three-year program will merge two existing capabilities:  (1) an all-sky
              imager at Millstone Hill to conduct sub-auroral science and support CEDAR
              campaigns at remote sites, and (2) the CEDAR Optical Tomographic Imaging
              Facility (COTIF).  The central component will be COTIF, used primarily at its
              current four sites in Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island to investigate the
              altitude-latitude-longitude emission patterns of airglow and auroral
              structures.  This location takes advantage of coordinated, multi-diagnostic
              instruments, including ISR, FPI, LIDAR and ionosonde systems.  Modeling efforts
              include airglow, diffuse auroral and SAR arc simulation codes to compare with
              the observed volume emission profiles from COTIF.
