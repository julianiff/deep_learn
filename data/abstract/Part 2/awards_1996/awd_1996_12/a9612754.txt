Abstract    :
              Request is made in this application for bio-computing  resources for the study
              of protein structure-function  relationships.   The proposed equipment consists
              of three  Silicon Graphics Indigo2 workstations and necessary software  for
              modeling protein structures, plus color printer and  additional disk drive for
              database storage.  These resources  will enable researchers to model enzyme
              specificities,  characterize protein-ligand binding interactions at the  atomic
              level, and carry out computationally intensive  calculations on proteins and
              nucleic acids.
