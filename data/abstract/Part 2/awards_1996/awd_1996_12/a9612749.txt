Abstract    :
              9612749  Pacek    This award is supported through the Small Grants for
              Exploratory Research mechanism.    This project  investigates the relationship
              between economic reforms and political party success in post-communist Albania.
               The transition of formerly authoritarian, communist nations into democratic
              free-market nations has been quite tumultuous.  This study collects regional
              economic, demographic, and political data in Albania surrounding the Albanian
              elections scheduled for May 26, 1996.  Contrasted with other former communist
              countries, the Albanian election appears to go against the recent electoral
              trend of the electorate shifting support to former communist parties.      The
              study will considerably enhance our understanding of the factors contributing
              to continuous support for democratic institutions in formerly communist
              nations.  ***
