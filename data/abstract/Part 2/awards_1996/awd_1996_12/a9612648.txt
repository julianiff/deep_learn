Abstract    :
              Abstract  EEC-9612645  Kraemer    The explosion of information technology is
              occurring through out the world, led by the United States. Very little is
              understood about the social, economic and industrial implications of this
              societal transformation effecting virtually everyone.  Research is necessary to
              provide information in the innovation, design, evaluation and support of
              product and services, provide guidelines to user organizations in the adoption,
              investment and application decisions; and data of value to policy makers in
              guiding and controlling this explosive growth.  This planning grant is studying
              the economic viability of forming an Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center for Information Technology and Organizations at the University of
              California, Irvine.    The research projects to be proposed for industrial
              support in the proposed Center are:  Online Information Resources and
              Interorganization Relationships; Computers and Multimedia: The Impact on
              American Households; Business Value of Information Technology; A Cost-Benefit
              Investigation of Groupware Usage by Financial Statement Auditors; Information
              Technology and Organizational Form; Enhancing End User Computing for Knowledge;
              Mapping Organizational Memory; Deployment of IT for Competitive Advantage;
              Scheduling and Patters of Meetings in large Organizations; High-Level
              Requirements Analysis for Information Systems Design.
