Abstract    :
                  The Information Theory Workshop will be held in Haifa, Israel  June 8-13,
              1996.  Papers will present new results in the following areas:  source coding, 
              Shannon theory, cryptography and security, detection and  estimation,
              statistics and information theory, coded modulation,  convolutional and block
              codes, network information theory, communication  techniques and models.    The
              Information Theory Workshops constitute a longstanding series of  distinguished
              meetings, tracking and furthering progress in the field of  Information Theory.
                 55 regular papers are scheduled for presentation.  There will also be a 
              recent-results session.  A plenary address will be given by Prof. Jacob  Ziv, 
              foreign member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering,  and  president of
              the Israeli Academy of Sciences.    Travel support for up to seven U.S.
              participants is requested. Highest  priority will be given to young researchers
              who are presenting papers and  invited speakers, all from US institutions. The
              travel reimbursement will  be arranged through the IEEE.
