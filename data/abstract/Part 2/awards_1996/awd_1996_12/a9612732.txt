Abstract    :
              The study of the mechanisms and kinetics of the dechlorination of small
              organochlorine  compounds forms the focus of this research project supported in
              the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program.  Dechlorination of chlorocarbons
              and polychlorinated biphenyls on  model iron and iron oxide surfaces will be
              examined using unique instrumentation for  desorbing and identifying reaction
              intermediates.  The combination of Fourier-transform  reflection absorption
              infrared spectroscopy with laser desorption Fourier-transform mass 
              spectrometry will provide information about the mechanisms and kinetics of
              these important  surface reactions which can not be otherwise obtained.  This
              information may have a  significant impact on the development of environmental
              remediation processes for chlorine  containing hydrocarbons.  The elimination
              of halogen containing hydrocarbons from soils and groundwaters is an  important
              environmental task.  The research supported in this project by the Analytical
              and  Surface Chemistry program uses a unique combination of techniques which
              can identify and  quantify reaction intermediates on surfaces and in the gas
              phase, to help in the development  of our understanding of dehalogenation
              chemistry on solid surfaces.  This understanding will  enable the design of
              more effective environmental remediation approaches for these widely  dispersed
              contaminants.
