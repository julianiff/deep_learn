              Title: Support for U.S. Participants in SCAR/IASC/PAGES  Workshop on Glaciers,
              Ice Sheets, and Sea Level, June 21-22, 1996  in Fjaerland, Norway    The ice
              bodies of the world contain sufficient water to raise  world-wide sea level by
              more than 70m if melted completely.   Glaciers and ice sheets might be a major
              source of water for the  present-day rise in sea level, but the uncertainty is
              large.  All  glacial ice on the Earth must be considered in evaluating the 
              contribution of changing ice masses to changing sea level.   Furthermore, it is
              necessary to consider the history of past  ice-sheet changes in order to
              interpret the present changes and  predict those of the future.  To evaluate
              all these factors in sea-  level changes and to point the way towards research
              programs to  evaluate, a Workshop will be held in Norway on the global 
              interactions between glaciers, ice sheets, and sea level.  This  award will
              make possible the participation by U.S. invitees in the  Workshop.
