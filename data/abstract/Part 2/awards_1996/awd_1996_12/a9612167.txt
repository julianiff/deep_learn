Abstract    :
              9612167  Nielsen   Large, decentralized engineering and scientific organizations
              headquartered   in the U. S. have identified electronic media as a strategic
              technology for   communication and information dissemination to their members
              and other   stakeholders.  This workshop brings together representatives of
              leading   technical professional organizations, industry leaders in electronic 
               publishing, and university researchers to address issues in the strategic  
              management of electronic document creation and delivery.  Conversion to  
              electronic media for communication and information dissemination represents   a
              significant organizational culture change that can be studied as a   process of
              technology diffusion within a social system.  Discussion at the   workshop will
              focus on technological choices, major impediments to   adoption, and means for
              overcoming them.  Recommendations will be made for   effective creation and
              delivery of electronic documents that are responsive   to the information needs
              of engineering and scientific communities.   The workshop will result in
              recommendations regarding technological   choices, recommendations for
              overcoming obstacles to the implementation of   electronic publishing, and
              mechanisms focused on the engineering and   scientific communities'
              requirements.  Workshop proceedings will be widely   disseminated to allow
              implementation of the recommendations in a   straightforward manner.
