Abstract    :
              An important optical network architecture is the wavelength division 
              multiplexed (WDM) network that supports lightpaths.  WDM is basically 
              frequency division multiplexing in the optical frequency range, where  carrier
              frequencies are referred to as wavelengths.  Lightpaths are end-to  end
              connections made up of connected WDM channels.  A network node is said  to have
              wavelength conversion capability if it can shift the wavelengths of  optical
              signals.  The advantage of wavelength conversion is that it allows  networks to
              support more ligthpaths, but its disadvantage is that it can be  expensive
              and/or difficult to implement.  This research will investigate  limited
              wavelength conversion that allows network nodes to perform some but  not all
              wavelength shifts.  Limited conversion means less complex and costly  hardware
              than full conversion, yet better channel utilization than no  conversion. 
              Network architectures and algorithms will be studied by  initially focusing on
              special and important network topologies such as the  star and ring, and then
              eventually covering general network topologies.  These will be analytically
              evaluated by worst case analysis that leads to  guaranteed performance results,
              and also by probabilistic methods. More  information on the project can be
              found at     http://spectra.eng.hawaii.edu/~sasaki/NSF/limited.html
