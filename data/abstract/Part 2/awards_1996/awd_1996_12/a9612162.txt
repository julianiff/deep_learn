Abstract    :
              9612162  GangaRao  The major objectives of this research are: 1) to establish 
              the enhancement of static bending and shear strength, and  stiffness of steel
              reinforced concrete members wrapped and  resin (adhesively) bonded with several
              layers of FRP fabrics  referred herin as HYBRIDS including failure modes, and
              2) to  evaluate long term strength and stiffness degradation rates  of these
              hybrids under harsh environments such as moisture  and temperature fluctuation,
              sustained stresses, and  chemical reactions.    A fundamental understanding of
              degradation and failure  mechanisms is essential for core concrete, skin with
              FRP  fabric, and the adhesives before implementing the proposed  repair
              techniques for the existing infrastructure that is in  disarray.  The
              degradation rates of adhesives and other  materials will be established through
              accelerated testing in  a weatherometer.  The test results will be evaluated
              through  a parallel research effort to establish the expected service-  life
              performance of hybrids.    This research will be coordinated with another
              parallel  effort to be funded by the West Virginia Department of 
              Transportation-Division of Highways, The Composite Institute-  SPI, and the
              Tonen Corporation of Japan.  ***
