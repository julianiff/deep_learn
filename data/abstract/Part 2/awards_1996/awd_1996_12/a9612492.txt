Abstract    :
              9612492  Wilcox    This project will conduct activities to determine the
              feasibility  of establishing a Mathematics Assessment Resources Service (MARS).
                MARS will work with selected sites to (disseminate high quality  performance
              assessment tasks more widely; (2) help those engaged in  reform to incorporate
              high quality assessments into their work; and  (3) help those monitoring
              effects of systemic reform by providing  good evaluation tools.  An outcome of
              the work will be revisions in  the materials suggested by the "proof of
              concept", and  identification of evidence used to determine successful 
              implementation.
