Abstract    :
              9612506  Stephanopoulos  The objective of this conference is to provide a 
              consensus definition of the field of Metabolic  Engineering, organize the
              mathematical, computational  and experimental tools presently available for the
               analysis of metabolic networks, and review the diverse  applications of the
              field.  There is no other forum for  this at the present time and there is much
              to be gained  by catalyzing interactions among different disciplines  of
              Metabolic Engineering.  Specifically, sessions on  the following topics have
              been planed to cover current  research activity: (1) metabolic engineering for
              the  production of novel products (biopolymers,  polyketides), (2) metabolic
              engineering applications in  fuels, chemical and materials production, (3)
              metabolic  engineering in plants, (4) genomics and metabolic  engineering, (5)
              metabolic engineering of intracellular  protein trafficking and cell cycle
              analysis, (6)  environmental applications, and (7) metabolic  engineering of
              organ function and therapy design.  ***
