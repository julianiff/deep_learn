Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT     Complex non-steady flow processes and induction mechanisms in
              pressure-exchange ejectors will be investigated.  The goal of the proposed work
              is to establish performance characteristic and design information that will
              allow the technology to be used in ejector refrigeration systems.  The research
              will have an experimental phase to determine the optimal design of the rotor,
              diffuser, and the nozzle in the ejector.  Theoretical and computational
              analyses will also be carried out to study the flow behavior inside the
              ejector.  Results from the theoretical study will be used to guide the design
              of the ejector.  Because ejector refrigerators are non-CFC based, they
              contribute to the reduction of hazardous effluents by avoiding them at the
              source. This project is jointly funded by NSF and EPA under the Partnership for
              Environmental Research Program.
