Abstract    :
              Anandakrishnan  OPP 9612536    Abstract  This award supports analysis of seismic
              data from the central  part of West Antarctica.  The use of broadband
              seismometers to  detect and record teleseismic earthquakes (so-called passive 
              seismology) is a relatively cost effective way of determining  physical
              parameters of the continental crustal and underlying  upper mantle.  These data
              can extend the results from reflection  and refraction seismic programs to
              regional scales and place  useful constraints on the interpretation of the
              reflection and  refraction data.  The method of Receiver Function analysis will
               be applied to the passive-seismic data and will be used to  determine crustal
              thickness and velocities at Central West  Antarctica camp (CWA).  Detailed
              reflection and refraction  seismic profiles collected at CWA will be compaped
              to the passive-  seismic results.  Next, passive-seismic data from STC, a site
              150  km from CWA, will be analyzed and the results correlated to CWA.  Regional
              trends will be identified and interpreted for their  tectonic significance.  In
              addition to analysis of teleseismic  data, this analysis takes advantage of
              data from an array of  seismometers (deployed for a microearthquake study of
              glacier  movement) that was near the active seismic program study area.
