Abstract    :
              9612453  Bagayoko    Bagayoko is Professor of Physics and Chancellor s Fellow at
               Southern University. His accomplishments include:    I.   Establishment of the
              Timbuktu Academy, which has a summer       program for 100 plus middle and high
              school students annually       and an academic year program for undergraduates,
              and is       nationally recognized as an exceptional program for mentoring     
               minority students in SEM disciplines -- Bagayoko has       intensively
              mentored over 200 students through the Physics       Department and the Academy
              since his arrival at Southern in       1984;      II.  Demonstrable student
              outcomes -- among Academy students, two       have received the University s
              highest academic awards,       University Grand Marshals; two have received
              Ph.D.s in Physics       and five others are completing their Ph.D.; 10 students
              have       received the M.S. degree in Physics;  many of these students      
              are themselves making meaningful contributions to science and       society;   
                III. Significant institutional impact and replicability -- started       in
              Physics, the Academy program has expanded to Chemistry and       Engineering;
              while Southern is a predominantly Black       institution, students from a
              variety of backgrounds have been       included and succeeded in his program,
              e.g., Asian, Hispanic,       and Caucasian; and      IV.  Strong testimonials
              from current graduate students about the       influence of Bagayoko personally
              and the Academy program on       their academic and career pursuits.
