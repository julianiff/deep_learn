Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9612120  BULLARD    This award provides funding for the first year
              of a four-year continuing award to the University of Illinois,
              Urbana-Champaign's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Air
              Conditioning and Refrigeration .  Currently there are 18 companies involved in
              the Center.      This Center has been in existence for six years.  Continued
              operational support for the next four years will enable the Center to continue
              the high level of graduate student involvement in its research program (112
              have been involved to date).  The Center's research is aimed at providing the
              technology base for a new generation of energy-efficient, quiet and reliable
              equipment that can use ozone-safe refrigerants.  The phaseout of
              environmentally-damaging refrigerants rendered nearly useless he industry's
              massive empirical data base which served as the foundation for design.  The
              Center's ongoing and proposed research provides a fundamental understanding of
              factors affecting: thermodynamic and transport properties of lubricants in pure
              and zeotropic mixtures of hydroflurocarbon refrigerants: heat transfer,
              pressure drop; frost formation and growth; friction and wear; and system
              performance, controls and diagnostics.    Additional funding is provided in
              this award to support two undergraduate students to work on two Center
              projects: "An integrated approach to experimental studies of air-side heat
              transfer enhancements" and "Modeling, diagnostics and controls for mobile air
              conditioning systems".
