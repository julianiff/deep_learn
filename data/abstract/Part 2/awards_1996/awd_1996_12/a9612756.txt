Abstract    :
              Compiler infrastructure is a key and enabling component of cutting-edge
              computing systems research.  Whether the research is focusing on developing new
              optimization algorithms, designing a new programming language, creating new
              software tools, developing and analyzing real-time systems, or exploring new or
              experimental architectural features, a complete, robust, and flexible
              compilation system is required to perform realistic experiments in a timely
              fashion.  This research project will develop a compiler infrastructure, called
              Zephyr, to meet the current and future needs of computing system researchers. 
              The leitmotiv of Zephyr's organization is the separation of the representation
              or form of Zephyr's intermediate languages from their content.  Decoupling the
              content of an intermediate language from its representation permits researchers
              to use an intermediate language most appropriate for their needs, to extend an
              existing intermediate language, or to develop a new HIL, yet still use Zephyr
              infrastructure and leverage off the efforts of other research groups also using
              the infrastructure.
