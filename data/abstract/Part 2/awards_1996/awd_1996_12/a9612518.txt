Abstract    :
              9612518    Keeling     In this project, measurements of the concentration of
              molecular oxygen and carbon dioxide in air samples will be continued. The
              samples are collected at a series of baseline sites around the world. The data
              will lead to improved estimates of the net exchange of carbon dioxide with land
              biota and the oceans, of marine photosynthesis rates, and of atmospheric mixing
              rates. These results are needed to improve our understanding of the processes
              regulating the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and of the
              processes regulating marine and terrestrial ecological functions in relation to
              various agents of change, especially climatic changes. In support of the
              measurement program, absolute standards for oxygen in air will be developed in
              order to ensure stable long-term calibration. A survey of the oxidative
              oxygen/carbon ratios of terrestrial and marine organic carbon will be
              conducted, in order to improve the quantitative basis for linking the oxygen
              and carbon dioxide geochemical cycles.  ***
