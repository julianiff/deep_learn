Abstract    :
              Abstract  EEC-9612323  Lee    The polymer industry is one of the major
              industries of the U.S. and it continues to grow.  Research is a necessary
              endeavor in order to maintain the U.S.' position in the global market.  This
              planning meeting is studying the viability of forming an Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for Advance Polymer Engineering at Ohio State
              University.    The proposed research agenda being studied as possible projects
              for the Center include 1) Advanced Liquid Composite Molding; 2) Low Profile
              Additives and Their Applications to Composite Processing; 3) Characterization
              of Low Pressure Sheet Molding and Bulk Molding Compounds; 4) Analysis of
              Injection Pultrusion Process; 5) Gas-Assisted Injection Molding; 6) Analysis of
              Co-Injection Molding Process; 7) Polymer Rheology and its Application to
              Film/Fiber Processing; 8) Ultrasonic Molding of Powder Polymers; 9) Extrusion
              Compounding of Polymer Blends; 10) Protyping of Mold/Parts by Polymer Fused
              Deposition Modeling and 11) Design of Injection Molding Parts/Molds.
