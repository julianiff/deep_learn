Abstract    :
                9612044    This work is an investigation of non-Fourier conduction in
              heterogeneous media. The possibility of the existence of thermal waves with
              relatively long relaxation times will be explored. The wave-like behavior may
              arise from the contact resistance and the differing thermal masses of the
              material constituents. Theoretical models will be used to identify
              characteristics of the microstructure likely to enhance or inhibit wave
              behavior.  These models will be validated against experiments to systematically
              demonstrate the expected phenomena.  Materials to be explored include porous
              media, composite media, food products, powders, and biological materials. 
              Applications  are expected in tumor and cell destruction, freezing and
              cryopreservation of biological materials, freeze-drying technology and the
              setting of adhesives.
