Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  9612507  Fruehan    This award provides phase out funding for the
              Carnegie Mellon University Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
              Iron and Steelmaking for its final year of support in the I/UCRC Program.  The
              center performs fundamental research in ironmaking, steelmaking, refining, and
              casting; educates students with strong technical skills applicable to the steel
              and steel-support industries; establishes a forum to discuss the long-term
              research needs of the industry;  and provides a mechanism for leveraging
              industrial funds through cooperative research government support.  In addition,
              the award supports the NSF evaluator to provide data to the NSF to evaluate the
              performance of the center.
