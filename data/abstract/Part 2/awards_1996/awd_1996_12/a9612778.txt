Abstract    :
              This project is exploring the vector implementation of speech algorithms on the 
              torrent processor, which was developed under previous NSF support.  Torrent is 
              specialized for the low-precision digital signal processing that arises in
              speech  recognition; it combines multiple fixed-point datapaths, a high
              bandwidth memory  system, and a high-speed RISC general-purpose controller. 
              Algorithms for the  computationally intensive tasks of speech recognition,
              including acoustic  probability estimation, feature extraction, lexical search,
              and evaluation of  grammatical probabilities, are being vectorized and
              implemented on Torrent  processor.  The system will be demonstrated using a
              2000-word natural speech  recognition task that will run using a free-standing
              microphone in a noisy  environment.
