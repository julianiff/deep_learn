Abstract    :
              9612577  Ling   This proposal is to organize a workshop on Maintenance Science. 
              The purpose of the proposed workshop is to identify the research areas that
              need to be addressed to advanced to advance maintenance system and operations,
              and product life-cycle modeling.  A comprehensive agenda for maintenance
              science research to focus on closing the science/technology gap will be
              developed and shared with researchers and practitioners in the research and
              industry communities.
