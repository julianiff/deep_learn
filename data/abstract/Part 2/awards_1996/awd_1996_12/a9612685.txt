Abstract    :
              Kenneth Eisenthal of Columbia University is supported by the Experimental  
              Physical Chemistry Program to continue his studies on chemical reaction  
              dynamics and chemical equilibria at liquid interfaces.  He will further  
              develop and refine methods that will extend the ways in which interfaces   can
              be investigated.  The major focus of his research will be the use of   second
              harmonic generation (SHG) and infrared plus visible (or   ultraviolet) sum
              frequency generation (SFG) to investigate acid-base   reactions/dynamics at
              air/water, oil/water, and solid/water interfaces.    This research includes
              studies of ground electronic state acid-base   equilibria and the
              photochemistry and photophysics of intermolecular   proton transfer and excited
              electronic state acid-base equilibria.    The significance of the proposed
              research derives from the inhomogeneous   nature of the physical and biological
              world and thus the prevalence of   interfaces separating the various phases and
              structures of matter.  For   this reason it is important to develop an
              understanding of interfaces at   the microscopic level.  There is also a
              significance that extends beyond   fundamental science because of the major
              role interfaces play in   technology (etching of computer chips, liquid phase
              catalysis and   transfer), in the environment (air/water, soil/water,
              air/atmospheric   aerosols, and air/stratospheric acidic ice surfaces), and in
              medicine   (drug delivery in pharmacology, anesthesia and general membrane
              chemistry   and photochemistry).
