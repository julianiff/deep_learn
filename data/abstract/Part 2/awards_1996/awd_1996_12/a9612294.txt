Abstract    :
              In this project, part of the Cross-Directorate program for   Multidisciplinary
              Research in Optical Science and Engineering, Tony Heinz   at Columbia
              University together with colleagues from several other   industrial and
              government laboratories will use optoelectronic techniques   to probe in the
              far-infrared spectral region excitations of molecules and   phonons in surfaces
              and thin films.  These researchers will develop and   refine coherent far
              infrared spectroscopy to study surface and interface   problems and will apply
              this technique to a wide range of hitherto   intractable measurements of
              surfaces and thin films.  Multiple reflection   and new waveguide geometries
              will enhance the sensitivity of the   technique for surfaces and thin films,
              and sum-frequency generation   schemes will mix broadband far infrared
              radiation with a spectrally   narrow visible wavelength laser pulse.  Ultrafast
              time-resolved   measurements will also be exploited in several studies. 
              Materials   systems to be examined include ionic dopants in polymeric thin
              films,   thin ferroelectric films, and marginal metals.  Surfaces and thin
              films involve a limited quantity of material, and   methods sensitive enough to
              study these systems are usually inadequate.    This research program will lead
              to new techniques for measuring very low   energy excitations at the surfaces
              of such condensed matter systems using   novel optoelectronic methods.  A broad
              cross section of materials and   problems will be examined which have
              significant technological relevance   and importance.
