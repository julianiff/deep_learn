Abstract    :
              9612362  Gorlov  The objective of the project is to conduct fundamental 
              engineering research on the ocean environment using  mathematical and physical
              models as well as the  demonstration floating power farm for harnessing energy
              from  ocean streams.    The key component of the ocean power project that makes
              if  feasible is the recently invented helical turbine that is a  breakthrough
              technological innovation to use hydro energy of  the oceans.  Technical
              development of the helical turbine  has been sponsored by the U.S. DOE, New
              England Power  Company and Allied Signal, Inc. in 1995-1996.  The Allied 
              Signal acquired the exclusive worldwide license on the  turbine and committed
              to build a demonstration project.    The research includes the following major
              tasks:    1. Development of theoretical and physical models of     oceanic
              power farms.    2. Fundamental research on engineering aspects related to    
              harnessing oceanic energy by means of such power farms     constructed under
              ocean surface.    3. Mathematical and experimental modeling and analysis of    
              the influence of the projected power farms on the global     ocean and
              atmospheric circulation and the water ecology.  ***
