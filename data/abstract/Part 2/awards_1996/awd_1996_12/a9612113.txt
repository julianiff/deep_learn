Abstract    :
              9612113  Renne  This project is to conduct a multi-disciplinary study of field,
              petrologic, geochemical. isotopic and geochronological study of a suite of
              ultrabasic-alkaline and mafic rocks of Maimecha-Kotui region of the northern
              Siberian platform.  The volcano-plutonic complexes of this region are closely
              associated in time and space with the Siberian Flood Basalt Province (SFBP) of
              permo-Triassic age.  As part of this study The P.I.s will also include the
              kimberlites with the alkalic and tholeiitic pulses of the SFBP mantle plume. 
              Preliminary data on 3He/3He measurements in olivines of the alkalic rocks
              suggest a lower mantle source for the 3He and links the alkalic-Maimecha phase
              to the plume-related SFBP.  More noble gas isotope ratio measurements (He, Ne,
              Ar and Xe) are needed for confirmation.  40Ar/39Ar age dating of kimberlites
              and of the ultrabasic-alkaline and mafic rocks of the 2.8 km thick
              Maimecha-Kotui volcanic section are proposed to determine age and duration of
              volcanism.  Nd, Sr, Pb-isotopic and trace elemental analyses, including the
              rare earth elements by TCP-MS, will also be performed on these rocks during the
              two-year tenure of the grant period.  The analytical results will be used to
              examine whether there is a common petrogenetic link (e.g., mantle-derived
              plume) for the origin of the Kharamai kimberlites, the ultrabasic-alkaline and
              mafic volcanic rocks of the Maimecha-Kotui section, and for the voluminous,
              predominantly tholeiitic SFBP.  In the event that these data do not support
              such a hypothesis, the acquired date will still be useful in formulating and
              substantiating other petrogenetic models.
