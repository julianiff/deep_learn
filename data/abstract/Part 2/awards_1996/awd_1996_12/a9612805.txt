Abstract    :
              9612805  Wortman       This proposal is to organize a workshop on Maintenance
              Science.  The purpose of the proposed workshop is to identify the research
              areas that need to be addressed to advanced to advance maintenance system and
              operations, and product life-cycle modeling.  A comprehensive agenda for
              maintenance science research to focus on closing the science/technology gap
              will be developed and shared with researchers and practitioners in the research
              and industry communities.
