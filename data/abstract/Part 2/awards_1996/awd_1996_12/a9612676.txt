Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS-9612676    The proposed project is to investigate heat transfer
              during selective laser sintering (SLS) of powdered materials.  The SLS
              technique is relatively new for rapid prototyping.  By selectively heating
              powders, non-isothermal sintering of powders would occur and uneven
              densification would follow.  Because the ultimate shape of the solid is
              strongly dependent on how the material consolidates, the densification
              occurring at the void level affects the ultimate shape of the macroscale solid.
               The goal of the project is to understand the heat transfer process taking
              place and develop a model to predict the final shape of the solid.  Such a
              model could us used to predict ways to minimize unwanted growth and improve
              manufacturing efficiency.  Experiments will be conducted to grow solids under
              various non-isothermal conditions.  A mathematical model based on a
              volume-average formulation will be developed to predict the shape of the grown
              solids.
