Abstract    :
                9612038  Stucky    Funds are provided to the American Chemical Society in the 
              Support of the 1996 ACS Meeting during August 25-30, 1996  to be held in
              Orlando, FL.  The requested funds would be  mostly used to support the
              attendance of young faculty and  5-8 postdocs and graduate students.  During
              this 2.5-day  symposium (Macromaterials: Angstroms to Microns),  established
              scientists in the diverse fields will present  results of their research on
              atomic and molecular assembly  to create three-dimensional patterning.  %%% 
              The topics are intended to deal with connecting atomistic  and continuum scales
              with three-dimensional ordering at  dimensionalities from the Angstrom to the
              micron level.  Invited speakers have been selected to ensure participation  by
              the leading research groups including, especially, new  avenues of research.
              The intent is to bring together  participants who have a wide variety of
              perspectives on  macro or mesoscale phenomena and the interface of inorganic 
              and organic chemistry.  ***
