Abstract    :
              9612422  Sandoval    Established in 1982, the NM MESA currently serves
              approximately  2,500 students in 7 middle and high schools throughout the
              state,  with 85% of the participants being underrepresented minorities and  59%
              being female. Mentoring is a critical component of the MESA  success, which
              also includes:      I.   Weekly contact with advisors/teachers, tutoring,
              academic       counseling, curriculum based enrichment activities, leadership  
                  workshops, field trips, summer enrichment classes, career       awareness
              speakers, scholarship opportunities, and academic       competitions;      II. 
              A continual support system that increases students  chances       for success
              in higher education, because they have developed       study, research and
              cooperative learning skills;      III. Over the last three years, 88% of NM
              MESA graduating seniors       enrolling in two or four-year institutions and
              71% of those       having chosen mathematics, science, or engineering related  
                  majors;      IV.  Significant MESA impact upon the course offerings and    
                enrollment for participating schools -- e.g. increase in the       number of
              minorities enrolled in college intended mathematics       and science course
              sequences; and      V.   Steady growth in the number of schools and school
              districts       that have chosen to participate; school districts must      
              contribute their own resources in this model of shared       responsibility for
              financial and academic support;  the NM       State Legislature has provided a
              steady growth in funding over       the past years.
