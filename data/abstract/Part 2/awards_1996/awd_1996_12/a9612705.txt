Abstract    :
              This research will update diurnally varying insolation rates using water vapor
              data from recent global climatologies that overlap the UARS experiment.  This
              enables direct comparison between observed and modeled tides.  The main
              objective is to clarify the effect of tropospheric heating on the seasonal and
              inter-annual variability of the propagating diurnal tide in the mesosphere and
              lower thermosphere.  This study will enable tide modelers to sort out
              tropospheric forcing from other mechanisms of tidal variability, such as
              gravity-wave drag and mean wind influences.  The PI's findings will contribute
              substantially to understanding the temporal variation of tides and global mean
              circulations in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere.
