Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9612108    A Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) imaging technique
              will be developed for the study of the dynamic microstructure and general
              behavior of powders under the effect of external vibrations.  The measuring
              techniques consists in a three-dimensional spatial scan approach rather than
              scans in conjugate spaces.  In order to avoid the scanning speed limitations in
              highly energetic flows, the synchronized vibration frequency and data from each
              scanning line separately will be stored, followed by retrospective data
              averaging and image reconstruction.  The proposed project will explore the
              feasibility of the proposed NMR measuring technique and will obtain the first
              measurements in three-dimensional particulate vibrated flows with potential
              progress in fundamental understanding of those flows.  The measurements will
              determine concentration and diffusive motion caused by particle collision
              during a single NMR scan.  The method will facilitate the measurements of
              particle velocity and concentration fluctuations.  The experimental work will
              be carried out by the P. I, in the NMR Laboratory of the Lovelace Institutes,
              which has uniquely specialized equipment and group of experts in the field of
              research.  Reference numerical simulations using the discrete element method
              will be performed at NJIT.  ***
