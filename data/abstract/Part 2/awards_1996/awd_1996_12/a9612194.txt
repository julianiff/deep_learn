Abstract    :
               9612194 Brady  This multidisciplinary research project utilizes advanced
              optical science methodology to address several fundamental research areas in
              the study of fundamental optical interactions and surface science phenomena
              associated with photo-assisted desorption, and in the exploration of coherent
              dynamics in metal quantum dots on silicon and InAs semiconductor surfaces. 
              Overall, the project aims to gain new knowledge and greater understanding of
              basic issues associated with the creation, addressing and/or modulation of
              spatially parallel arrays of atoms, molecules, or nanostructures.  Examples of
              issues to be addressed are: coupling of optical signals to surface-bound atoms,
              propagation of electrical signals across atomic arrays, registration of
              ultra-fast optical signals in surface states to maintain information capacity
              and coherence, and the potential utilization of photochemical interactions to
              create and operate nanometer scale devices. %%% The project combines concepts
              and methodologies from materials science, electrical engineering, chemistry and
              physics with advanced optical methods and related characterization tools to
              address forefront issues at the interfaces between these disciplines.  The
              research will contribute basic new knowledge at a fundamental level to several
              aspects of materials science, engineering, and information processing.  An
              important feature of the program is the integration of research and education
              through the training of students in fundamental interdisciplinary research
              areas. ***
