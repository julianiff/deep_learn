Abstract    :
              This project will study the feasibility of a petaflops-class computer for use in
              particle simulations in astrophysics and other areas of computational science. 
              The planned system will operate by performing the most CPU-intensive part of a
              simulation (the computations of long-range interparticle forces) in hardware,
              leaving the remainder of the calculation to a front-end host computer of more
              traditional design.  Confidence in the basic structure of the hardware is
              strengthened by the success of the 1.1 Tflops "GRAPE-4" system, which has a
              similar design philosophy and became operational on 1995.  Utilizing
              straightforward improvements in fabrication technology, a petaflops machine is
              a realistic goal by the year 2000.  Significant questions must be studied to
              refine design ideas, explore configuration option, and ensure the widest
              applicability of the new machine.  A number of target problem areas in
              astrophysics, with a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, have been
              identified.  Preliminary estimate suggest that substantial gains will be
              realized over the conventional general-purpose supercomputers likely to be
              available in  the year 2000, with a time advantage of over a decade in some
              cases.  Outside astrophysics, the subject most likely to benefit from a
              special-purpose computational engine of this sort are molecular dynamics and
              vortex fluid methods.
