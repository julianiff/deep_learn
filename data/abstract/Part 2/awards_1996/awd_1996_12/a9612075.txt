Abstract    :
                    Profs. T. Branson, P. Jorgensen, and F. Radulescu will host an  NSF/CBMS
              conference on "Spectral Problems in Geometry and Arithmetic"  at the University
              of Iowa August 18-22, 1997, featuring Prof. Peter  Sarnak (Princeton
              University) as principal speaker.  The conference is  aimed at making
              accessible to researchers, potential researchers, and  graduate students in the
              region important and exciting current work on  the spectral theory of
              Laplacians and Hecke operators, the Selberg and  Ramanujan conjectures, as well
              as applications to quantum chaos and  other physical issues.  Prof. Sarnak is
              an internationally recognized  expert on these topics.    Despite their
              importance, the topics of the conference are  sufficiently new and
              background-intensive that special efforts are  needed to broaden the pool of
              researchers able to understand and work  on them.  For example, these topics
              are seldom reached in graduate  coursework at all but the most elite
              universities.  The organizers  plan to draw on extensive contacts developed
              over recent years by the  University of Iowa to ensure the broadest possible
              participation.
