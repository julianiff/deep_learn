Abstract    :
              ***  9612376  Young         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project addresses the problem of associating  consistent, quantitative error
              rate estimates with DNA sequence data and the resulting improved  quality
              control on such data. The growing use of DNA sequence data in research,
              databases,  diagnostic and therapeutic biotechnology, and even litigation
              requires that the quality of data  being used be objectively assessable.
              Variables will be identified which are important to quality  control of  DNA
              sequencing such as error dependency on sequence content and position. Methods
              will be   developed for including such error rate information into existing and
              developing database  entries and, based on results from sequencing known
              optimally designed DNA sequences,  provide a quality control score for
              laboratories which routinely contribute DNA sequence data to  such databases.
              The project will also develop protocols and user-friendly software for 
              periodically assessing the current state of performance for given sequencing
              machines. This  investigation will be based on theoretical statistical
              analyses, computer simulations, and on  results from sequencing experiments
              using specially designed, synthetic DNA fragments.  ***
