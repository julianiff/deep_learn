Abstract    :
              9612717  Bidwell    This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement study examines the
              conditions under which students oppose efforts to educate them.  Traditional
              views often characterize resistance as something intrinsic to the adolescent
              world.  In contrast, this research takes the view that resistance is not
              necessarily intrinsic to the adolescent world but is in great part determined
              by the organization of learning in the classroom and the curriculum.  This
              study focuses on the multiple relational structures of three separate high
              schools at the school and classroom levels.  At the school level, the distinct
              but interdependent relational structures (i.e., course curriculum,
              extra-curricular activities, and student friendships) will be investigated
              while at the classroom level micro-relations that persist within individual
              settings will be examined.  Month-long visits will be conducted in 10th, 11th
              and 12th grade classes in three high schools (located in Kansas City, Kansas,
              Grand Rapids, Michigan and Brookline, Massachusetts) to administer surveys to
              students on classroom friendships, perceptions of teaching style, relationship
              with teacher and course subject-matter.  Survey data will be supplemented with
              observational data.  These data will be analyzed to identify the dimension and
              level at which the organization of student relations is most likely to lead
              students to resist educational efforts.   ***  ??
