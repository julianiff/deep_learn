Abstract    :
              9612459  Robin    Robin, a retired chemist from A.T.& T. Laboratories, has
              served as  a volunteer at Science High School, a small, public magnet school 
              in a large urban city, Newark, N.J. since 1991. His accomplishments  include:  
               I.   Establishment of the Student Independent Research Program,       which
              engages interested students in the pursuit of long-term       science research
              projects and encourages them to enter state       and national competitions
              such as the New Jersey Science Fair,       Rutgers University Junior Science
              Symposium, NAACP ACTSO,       National Black Chemist and Chemical Engineers
              Science Bowl;    II.  Secures grants to maintain the program, which is not     
               maintained by the school district -- project SEED, an American       Chemical
              Society grant, and A.T.& T. Minority Grants program;      III. Directs his own
              funds into the program;      IV.  Spends countless hours coaching, mentoring,
              and acquiring       materials and equipment for urban schools that serve
              primarily       Black and Hispanic students; and      V.   Of the 21 students
              participating since 1992, 18 are       underrepresented students (15 Black or
              Hispanic and three       white females).  All have received awards for their   
                 achievement, including one Westinghouse semi-finalist, and a       four-year
              scholarship to Stevens Institute of Technology for       another.  Students
              attend other schools such as M.I.T.,       Dartmouth, Bates, and Rutgers
              University.    As a retiree from industry, Robin was recommended for this award
              on  the basis of the quality and outcomes of his work with  underrepresented
              minorities in science and mathematics.
