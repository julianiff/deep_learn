Abstract    :
              The is a joint effort through subcontracts, with Raj Roy, Georgia Institute  of
              Technology, and Steven Strogatz, Cornell University    The researchers will
              investigate synchronization of chaotic lasers for  purposes of using chaos as a
              carrier for new modes of communication  including multiplexing information
              bearing signals and private  communications using chaotic carriers as well as
              methods for optical  channel equalization using nonlinear properties of the
              fiber. The program  will include experiments on Nd:YAG and Erbium Doped lasers,
              analysis of  synchronization methods and innovative communications techniques,
              and  mathematical analysis of synchronization of a few and assemblies of
              chaotic  oscillators with application to optical communications.    A "group
              meeting" workshop will be held semi-annually and each year we will  invite
              experts in optics, optical engineering, and optical communications  to provide
              additional research expertise to broaden the horizons of the  students,
              postdoctoral fellows, and faculty involved in this project
