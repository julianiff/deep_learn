Abstract    :
              IRI-9612768         This award funds a research-planning workshop that is 
              intended to discuss promising new and emerging applications for  robotics, and
              to identify research needs to facilitate the  realization of those
              applications.  The workshop is co-sponsored  by the Robotics Industries
              Association and by the IEEE Robotics  and Automation Society.  It is be held in
              Santa Fe,  New Mexico,  in November 1996.  The Robotics and Machine
              Intelligence Program  of NSF  has long had a strategic objective of supporting
              research  that would enhance robotics system performance and usability, 
              thereby gaining acceptance and adoption of robotics technologies  across a
              broad spectrum of application domains.  The workshop  aims to establish or
              enhance connections between technology  researcher/developers and potential end
              users, leading to  stimulation of  research of increased strategic value. 
              Thus, the  design of the workshop includes involvement of lots of industry 
              participants, primarily representing end-users, with a few  robotics vendors,
              and a number of  academic researchers.  Discussion groups will address needs
              identification, research  identification, and  research transition.  Several
              planned  publications from the workshop should assure wide dissemination  of 
              the findings and recommendations.
