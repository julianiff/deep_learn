Abstract    :
              9612780  Leburton  The International Conference on Quantum Devices and Circuits
              is dedicated to recent research I various aspects of the science and
              engineering of electronic and optical devices, as well as circuits and systems
              that exploit mesoscopic or quantum-mechanical phenomena in their operation. 
              This conference will be first to bring together experts from diverse fields. 
              It is intended to promote interaction between physicists, molecular chemists,
              engineers and computer scientists who all have a role to play  in the
              development of  the next generation of computers and electronics employing
              nanotechnology.    NSF funds will support graduate students attending the
              meeting.  ***
