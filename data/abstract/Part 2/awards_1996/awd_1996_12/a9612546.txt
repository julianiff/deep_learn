Abstract    :
              The Sun's magnetic field is created by dynamo action in the solar convection
              zone, probably deep within that layer and in the overshoot region at the top of
              the radiative interior.  The dynamo mechanism is strongly affected by the
              differential rotation within the convection zone, which itself is largely
              driven by Reynolds stresses associated with the turbulence.  The PI will
              develop a new simulation of the solar dynamo and the differential rotation
              within the solar convection zone.  For this, he will further develop the
              turbulent transport theory necessary to explain the mean fluxes of magnetic
              field, momentum and entropy by the scales of turbulence that are unresolvable
              in global simulations.  To validate and complete the theory, he will perform
              numerical simulations of convective magneto-turbulence in control volumes
              representing various depths and latitudes of the solar interior.  When a robust
              parameterization of the turbulence has been obtained, he will use it in a
              global simulation of the differential rotation and the mean solar magnetic
              field.
