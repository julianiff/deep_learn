Abstract    :
              9612675    This RPG research is a preliminary study which will lead to 
              development of  a systematic approach to risk assessment for foundations at 
              sites that are  susceptible to sinkhole formation.  This approach will  combine
               characterization, preparation and design to assess risk of  structures  (e.g.,
              buildings, highways, and retaining walls) built on  karst terrain.  Following a
              literature review, standard approaches to risk  assessment will  be evaluated
              to determine which approach or hybrid of  approaches would be  best suited to a
              systems approach analysis.  The study will  include recent  case studies of
              structure damage and/or collapse due to  sinkholes, and  assess the limitations
              in current methods used to  characterize sites and  design foundations in karst
              areas.  ***
