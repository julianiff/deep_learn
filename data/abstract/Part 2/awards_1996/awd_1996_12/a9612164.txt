                9612164  Tomsia  The proposed conference, which occurs only once every ten
              years,  will provide a summary of the progress made in the past 10 years  as
              well as  provide a format for establishing research trends on  advanced
              ceramics for the next 10 years.  The conference will  have sessions on
              characterization, processing, electrical  properties, and mechanical properties
              after an introductory  plenary session.  The invited speakers represent the
              best in the  world in their particular areas.  %%%  The proposed conference,
