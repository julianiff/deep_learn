Abstract    :
              9612360  King, Willis    IEEE Computer Society    Special Project:  Annual
              International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering    This proposal,
              from the IEEE Computer Society,  partially supports an International Workshop
              on CS and CE accreditation.  Selected visitors from foreign countries will be
              brought to the meeting November 10-11, 1996, immediately following the FIE
              Conference in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Goals include the understanding of
              educational objectives and standards of different nations, to attempt to form a
              common set of criteria for accreditation and to work toward mutual recognition
              of computing degrees among nations.  The workshop is an IEEE-CS initiative and
              the Computer Society will provide 50% of the total cost.  Other cooperating
              societies include ACM, ABET, CSAB, and IEEE.  ***
