Abstract    :
              This postdoc will study the effect of atmospheric tides on winds and temperature
              at the mesopause, as well as their effect on the sodium density and nightglow. 
              Based on a Magneto-Optical Doppler Analysis (MODA) the postdoc has constructed,
              the research will be conducted at the Colorado State Lidar Facility.  The
              postdoc will analyze the seasonal variations of tidal signatures in winds and
              sodium nightglow intensity from MODA data set, and temperature and sodium
              density from lidar data set.  He will also have direct access to new data from
              lidar measurements of temperature, winds and sodium density.
