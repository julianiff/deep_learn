Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT  EEC-9612504  El-Aasser    This award provides funding to cover a
              second five years of NSF support for the Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for Polymer Interfaces at Lehigh University.  The Center's
              mission is directed to the development of molecular-level understanding of the
              structural, dynamic, kinetic and energetic behavior of the interphase region
              between polymers and substrates.  The research program is organized in three
              interactive themes:  1) the adsorption/characterization; 2) the
              wetting/adhesion; and 3) mechanical behavior.  Research results in these themes
              will be applicable to advanced engineering plastics, coatings, and composites. 
              Currently ten industrial firms provide the bulk of funds assisting in research
              planning, selection, and review of projects.
