Abstract    :
              The Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences will continue  to administer
              the conference series known as the NSF/CBMS  Regional Research Conferences.  In
              the twenty-eight year history  of this series, a total of 257 such conferences
              have been held.   Under its cooperative agreement with NSF, CBMS solicits
              proposals  for individual conferences, organizes a panel review for the 
              proposals, and oversees the publication of the monographs.    The purpose of
              these conference is to stimulate interest and  activity in mathematical
              research.  Each five day conference  features a distinguished lecturer who
              delivers ten lectures on a  topic of important current research in one sharply
              focussed area  of the mathematical sciences.  The lecturer subsequently
              prepares  an expository monograph based upon these lectures, which is  normally
              published as a part of a regional conference  series.  Depending upon the
              conference topic, the monograph is  published by the American Mathematical
              Society, the Society for  Industrial and Applied Mathematics, or jointly by the
              American  Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical 
              Statistics.  Each conference is funded separately by NSF. Support  for about 30
              participants is provided and the conference  organizer invites both established
              researchers and interested  newcomers, including postdoctoral fellows and
              graduate students,  to attend.
