Abstract    :
              This is a three year project to further develop a scalable, distributed
              multi-threaded architecture for the management, simulation and distribution of
              inter-domain policy-based routing information for the Internet.  It follows on
              the success of a previous award to Merit to develop a  distributed
              multi-threaded route server (MRS), and will develop tools and methodologies for
              benchmarking and evaluating the performance of the server in a variety of
              complex inter-domain routing environments.  Merit also will work with
              researchers using the DARPA-funded CAIRN network and the RAISE (Rational ATM
              Internet Suite).
