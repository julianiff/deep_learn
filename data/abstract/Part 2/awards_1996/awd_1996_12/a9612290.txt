Abstract    :
              The theory of black holes and relativistic stars in general  relativity was
              largely developed during the period from the  mid 1960's to the mid 1970's. 
              However, in recent years many  important, new developments in this area have
              occurred as a  result of a number of independent lines of research.  These 
              lines of investigation include:  (1) Research associated  with the `Grand
              Challenge` effort to study the details of  black hole collisions by numerical
              techniques.  (2) Analyses  of the potential ability of LIGO and other
              gravitational  wave detectors to probe detailed properties of black holes  and
              neutron stars.  (3) New evidence from the Hubble Space  Telescope and other
              observations for the presence of black  holes.  (4) Theoretical analyses of the
              internal structure  of black holes, which suggest that the `inner horizon` 
              occurring in idealized models of black holes may become a  null singularity of
              a relatively mild type for realistic  black holes.  (5) Further analyses of the
              Hawking effect and  its analog in 2-dimensional theories, particularly with 
              regard to the issue of whether purity of states is restored  in the black hole
              evaporation process.  (6) Numerous  investigations in the contexts of classical
              general  relativity, semiclassical gravity, quantum gravity, and  string theory
              regarding the nature and origin of black hole  entropy.  To discuss these
              recent developments, a Symposium on `Black  Holes and Relativistic Stars` will
              be held on the University  of Chicago Campus on the weekend of December 14 and
              15, 1996  (just prior to the Texas Symposium, also to be held in  Chicago). 
              The Symposium will consist entirely of two days  of plenary lectures of
              approximately one hour duration each  by V. Ferrari, J. Friedman, J. Hartle,
              S.W. Hawking, W.  Israel, R. Penrose, M. Rees, R. Sorkin, S. Teukolsky, K. 
              Thorne, R. Wald, and E. Witten.  The Symposium will be  dedicated to the memory
              of S. Chandrasekhar.
