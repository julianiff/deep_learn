Abstract    :
              ***  9612126  Azadivar      The goal of this project is an in-depth
              understanding of the social, behavioral and related barriers for small
              manufacturing companies in managing the innovation process from the conception
              of an idea to its successful implementation.  Based on these findings,
              techniques will be developed that will assist individuals and organizations in
              the decisions within the innovation process that require integration of social
              and behavioral factors as well as financial and technological considerations. 
              These techniques will be evaluated and refined with Manufacturing Learning
              Center (MLC) members and their impact evaluated on MLC members' innovation
              process results.  The techniques identified through this project will be
              integrated into the learning experience of the student interns with MLC as well
              as shared through publications and workshops.        This work should offer a
              broader understanding of the social and behavioral barriers to innovation in
              small manufacturing firms as well as providing management techniques to
              minimize these barriers to the innovation process in these types of
              organizations.    ***
