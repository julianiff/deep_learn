Abstract    :
              9612409  Campbell    For 22 years, NACME has led a national effort to increase
              the  number of African American, Latino, and American Indian engineers.  With
              mentoring as the cornerstone of its students development  programs, NACME has: 
                I.   Produced more than 6,000 underrepresented minority students       who
              have completed engineering degrees through NACME       scholarship programs,
              which include a strong mentoring       component, academic support,
              professional development,       undergraduate research or internships, and
              need-based       financial aid;      II.  Demonstrated student success in
              various special programs --       84% retention rate (out of 120 students)
              compared to the       national average of 35% for minorities; an average GPA of
              3.4       for these students, with almost half of the graduates pursuing      
              advanced degrees full-time;      III. Provides rigorous training for mentors,
              i.e. an engineer, a       professor, or NACME staff;      IV.  Provides an
              effective structure in its projects for       precollege, bridge and
              undergraduate support and solicits       involvement from professionals,
              faculty, and professional       societies;      V.   Disseminated program
              characteristics through publications and       through projects designed for
              special groups; and      VI.  Developed a program that is replicable and likely
              to continue       to influence the success of underrepresented groups for      
              sometime to come.
