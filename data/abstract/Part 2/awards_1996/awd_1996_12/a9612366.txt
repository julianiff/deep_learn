Abstract    :
              9612366   Slanger   Excited states of molecular oxygen are ubiquitous throughout
              the atmosphere, and their spectroscopy, radiative properties, and kinetics are
              essential elements in determining the photophysics and photochemistry of
              atmospheric regions. In this project, three areas will be investigated: a)
              kinetics and reactivity of the O2(b) state in vibrationally excited levels, b)
              weakly bound but potentially important states of O2 lying near the dissociation
              limit, and c) exploration of isotope effects in O2 photoabsorption in the
              242-250 nm Herzberg band absorption region.   The O2(b) state has been studied
              primarily in its lowest vibrational level, yet there are indications of
              stratospheric sources involving much higher vibrational levels, and their
              kinetic properties could be important. The weakly-bound states of O2 have been
              discussed in various contexts, yet there are no relevant measurements. The
              technique of cavity ring-down spectroscopy is making it possible to investigate
              these states, which are implicated as precursors in both laboratory and
              atmospheric phenomena. Variability in atmospheric oxygen isotope ratios in
              ozone, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide are of current interest, and cavity
              ring-down studies may be helpful in explaining these effects.  ***
