Abstract    :
              Dr.  Alan Stone, Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering,   Johns
              Hopkins University, is supported through  the Chemistry Division   and through
              the Earth Sciences Division by the Environmental Geochemistry   and
              Biogeochemistry program to support young scientist participation in   the 1996
              Environmental Sciences Water Gordon Conference entitled   `Interaction of
              Chemical and Biological Processes` on June 23-28, 1996 in   New Hampton, New
              Hampshire. The objective of this conference is to   highlight important new
              findings stemming from collaborative efforts   among chemists, biologists,
              physical scientists, and engineers   collaborating on studies of environmental
              processes involving nutrient   uptake and elemental cycling, pollutant effects
              and transformations, and   biochemical and physiological responses to
              environmental change.  This conference will provide an opportunity for young
              scientists working   in an important area of environmental science to share
              their results and   experiences in the field.  It is a multidisciplinary
              conference with   participants from a broad range of scientific and engineering
                disciplines, and it will likely foster new collaborations and the  
              development of integrated, multidisciplinary approaches to critical  
              environmental issues.
