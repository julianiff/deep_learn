Abstract    :
              Juang  9612116  This research is aimed at improving the engineer's ability  to
              predict earthquake-induced liquefaction hazards.  (Liquefaction is a serious
              form of soil failure resulting  from strong-ground shaking, typically
              associated with major  earthquakes, such as the 17 January 1995 earthquake in
              Kobe,  Japan.) It employs the fuzzy neural network methodology, an  emerging
              technology which can learn and adapt structured and  unstructured knowledge.   
              Historical data on field liquefaction performance, in terms  of causes and
              effects, is re-cataloged in a consistent  pattern usable by fuzzy neural
              networks. Uncertainty  associated with field performance data and the 
              interpretation of liquefaction hazards is handled through  the use of fuzzy
              sets, which allows for approximate and  continuous classification. Membership
              functions of fuzzy  soil and geological parameters are established through 
              consultation with experts in soil failure and fuzzy neural  network
              methodology. The collected data and expert opinions,  presented in a form
              usable by fuzzy neural networks, is then  used to generate trained neuro-fuzzy
              systems for predicting  liquefaction hazards.    It is expected that this
              research will result in a new  design methodology and procedure to predict
              earthquake-  induced liquefaction hazards using neuro-fuzzy systems.
