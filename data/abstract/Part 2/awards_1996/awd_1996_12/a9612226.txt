Abstract    :
              This award to Daniel Weitekamp at the California Institute of Technology   and
              Frank Grunthaner at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is supported by the  
              Advanced Materials Program in Chemistry and the Solid State Chemistry   Program
              in the Division of Materials Research. The collaborative program   will deal
              with the development of advanced optical nuclear magnetic   resonance  (NMR)
              techniques and their application to the characterization   of defects in III-V
              epitaxially grown compound semiconductors in   microelectronic devices.
              Specifically, the application of  time-sequenced   optical NMR and Larmor beat
              detection to optical nuclear polarization   methods will be developed and
              applied to semiconductor devices.  This new   technique will non-destructively
              detect  semiconductor defects at the   part-per-billion level, far exceeding
              the sensitivity of existing   methods. Modeling studies based on a 
              particle-in-a-box model of quantum   confined wave functions will complement
              experimental measurements.  This new characterization technique will provide an
              unprecedented   microscopic view of the structure and function of semiconductor
              quantum   well optoelectronic devices, answering long-standing fundamental  
              questions. The high accuracy of the information will reduce trial and   error,
              accelerating the large national effort to realize high performance   electronic
              and photonic devices, particularly those based on   quantum-confined
              structures.
