Abstract    :
              The PIs will conduct a comprehensive study of the mesospheric metal layers in
              the Arctic.  This will employ two field-proven laser systems to carry out
              simultaneous common volume observations of at least two species in each
              observation period.  A resonance lidar already operating at Poker Flat will
              perform the daytime observations.  The PI will extend current observations by
              installing a second lidar system to sound other mesospheric metal species
              against a continuous set of sodium observations.  This will provide a set of
              comprehensive high-resolution, long-duration benchmark observations for
              studying a variety of aeronomy issues in the mesopause region.  These
              observations will be supported by ongoing OH interferometer, all-sky camera,
              and photometer and magnetometer observations.  In addition, collaborators at
              the University of Pennsylvania will analyze the results with time-resolved
              models.
