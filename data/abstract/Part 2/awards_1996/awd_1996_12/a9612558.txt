Abstract    :
              9612558  Dahleh       We propose to carry out basic research in the areas of 
              identification robust control, and nonlinear robust control.  In  the
              identification area, we intend to examine new paradigms in  which model
              uncertainty is part of the model structure  parametrization, such that the
              resulting identified models are  readily usable for robust control purposes. 
              Fundamental issues  relating to identifiability of model sets, input design, 
              algorithms, and sample complexity will be addressed.  In the  robust control
              area we propose to develop robust analysis and  synthesis tools for more
              general classes of performance, which  are more relevant to practical design
              objectives than the worst-  case paradigms employed at present.  Moreover, we
              will further  investigate the optimal l1 problem in state space to derive a 
              separation structure for the optimal output feedback controller.   In the
              nonlinear area, our purpose is to provide computational  analysis and design
              tools for classes of nonlinear systems that  capture a wide range of
              applications.  One such class is the set  of linear parameter-varying systems. 
              The goal is to provide a  catalog of special problem structures and
              corresponding tools for  analysis and controller design. In addition, we will
              search for  structures that have low dimensional nonlinear components in such 
              a way that the computational complexity of the analysis problem  is directly a
              function of these nonlinear components.  Other  related topics will be
              considered.  ***
