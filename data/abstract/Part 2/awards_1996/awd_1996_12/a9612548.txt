Abstract    :
              9612548  Gill      This grant provides $20,000 as one-half support of the costs
              of  upgrading their present VG Sector 54 thermal ionization mass  spectrometer
              (TIMS) with a wide aperture retarding potential  (WARP) lens and third
              generation VG Faraday cups to replace their  eight existing cups.  The WARP
              lens will greatly increase the  abundance sensitivity of this instrument (by
              two orders of  magnitude) allowing measurement of thorium (Th) isotope ratios 
              for petrogenic studies of mid ocean ridge basalts (MORB) without  the frequent
              downtime required for baking the TIMS and greater  precision analyses of
              uranium (U), strontium (Sr), lead (Pb) and  Hafnium (Hf) isotopes for improved
              U/Pb geochronology and  isotopic tracer studies of magma genesis.  The third
              generation  faraday cups minimize secondary electron loss due to design 
              improvements including increased depth and improved internal  coatings and thus
              provide improved precision and minimal gain  drift relative to their existing
              cups.  These improvements will  enhance the capabilities of this lab for a wide
              range of studies  including, U-series isotopic studies of oceanic and
              continental  volcanics as petrogenic tracers, Lu/Hf isotopic analyses of deep 
              crustal xenoliths for dating melt extraction events as young as  25 Ma, Sr
              isotopic analyses of bone and tooth apatite as  indicators of the paleodiet and
              migration behavior of fossil  invertebrates, high resolution (100ka) Sr isotope
              stratigraphy  and studies of the biogeochemistry of lead.  ***
