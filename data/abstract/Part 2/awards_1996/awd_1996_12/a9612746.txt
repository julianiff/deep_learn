Abstract    :
              This proposal requests partial support of Gordon Conference  meeting expenses
              from the Computational Biology Program.  Fundamental experimental, theoretical,
              and computational  underpinnings of macromolecular crystallography have
              experienced  explosive growth in recent years.  In contrast to past Gordon 
              Conferences, these computational and experimental underpinnings  will be
              emphasized by bringing together major exponents of  experimental and ab initio
              phasing approaches.  Sessions will  also be devoted to issues involving new
              experimental facilities,  particularly the Advanced Photon Source.
