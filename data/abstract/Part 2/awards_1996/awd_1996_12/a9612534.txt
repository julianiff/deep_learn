Abstract    :
              Romero  9612534      One of the defining features of life is the interaction of
              an  organism with its environment.  Unfortunately, not all such  interactions
              are benign and the effects of noxious or stressful  stimuli must somehow be
              ameliorated in order for an organism to  survive.  Vertebrates react to noxious
              stimuli with a suite of  behavioral and hormonal responses, collectively called
              the stress  response.  The stress response is crucial for survival since even 
              mildly noxious stimuli can cause death in animals unable to  respond. 
              Unfortunately, long-term exposure to stress can lead to  a multitude of
              deleterious effects, including brain cell death.   Presumably, a balance must
              be struck between needing a stress  response to survive a noxious stimuli and
              controlling that stress  response to prevent deleterious effects.  Recent
              studies by Dr.  Romero have suggested that some species seasonally control
              stress  responses.  The present studies are investigating the novel  mechanisms
              by which this unique seasonal regulation of the  behavioral and hormonal
              components of the stress response occurs.   These studies are making important
              new contributions to our  understanding of the basic neuroendocrine regulation
              of the stress  response.  In addition, the studies will provide significant new
               insights into the physiological strategies employed by species in  the wild to
              grow, prosper and reproduce.
