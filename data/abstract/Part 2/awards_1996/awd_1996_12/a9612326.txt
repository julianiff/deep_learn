Abstract    :
              9612326  Carley    The aim of this Dissertation Improvement research is to
              examine how individuals actively restructure their social networks in response
              to a life stressor, in this case an HIV diagnosis.  A theory of network
              restructuring is proposed that is based on work in sociology and psychology on
              network evolution, in psychology and sociology on stress, and in social
              psychology on social support.  According to this theory, it is predicted that
              in response to a life stressor: (1) the social support network becomes smaller;
              (2) the social support network becomes more dense (i.e., there are a greater
              proportion of relationships among the members of the network); and (3)
              informational and social support networks become more similar (i.e., the number
              of individuals who co-occur in both networks increases).  The research
              investigates these hypotheses using data collected from individuals who will be
              gathered on a voluntary basis from a subject pool of more than 3000 men who are
              at high risk of infection or are already infected with HIV.  A semi-structured
              interview will be conducted with participants to solicit information on their
              different types of networks (i.e., positive socio-emotional support, negative
              socio-emotional support, informational support, and the informed). 
              Multivariate statistical techniques will be used to analyze the interview data.
