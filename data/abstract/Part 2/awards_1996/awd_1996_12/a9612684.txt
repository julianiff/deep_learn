              Abstract  ATM-9612684  deMenocal, Peter  Columbia University  Title: Modeling
              Climate and Deep Water Sensitivity to Changes in  Deglacial Meltwater Flux and
              Location Using a Fully-Coupled Ocean-  Atmosphere GCM    This award supports a
              project that will use a synchronously-coupled  ocean-atmosphere general
              circulation model (O-A GCM ) to examine  the dynamical origins of rapid,
              millennial-scale climate change  events which punctuate the last glacial and
              deglacial periods.   Focus will be on deep circulation and surface climate
              responses to  prescribed changes in the supply and input location of deglacial 
              meltwater to the ocean.  The NASA GISS O-A GCM used in this  proposal is unique
              because: 1) it does not require flux corrections  to sustain realistic Atlantic
              deep water circulation so the entire  climatic system is free to adjust to
              changed boundary conditions,  2) surface runoff is organized in 41 separate
              river drainages  allowing for point-source freshwater injection to the ocean,
              3) the  ocean model is truly synchronously-coupled (every hour) to a full 
              atmospheric model, and 4) the model supports oxygen-isotopic  fractionation and
              tracer code to monitor resulting changes in  Greenland ice composition.  Three
              research foci will be addressed:  1) characterize the ocean-atmosphere model
              climate signatures  associated with high and low deep-water production in the
              control  model; 2) quantify deep circulation sensitivity to changes in the 
              flux and location of deglacial meltwater input to the ocean; and 3)  Younger
              Dryas simulation: effects of variable deglacial runoff  volumes and input
              locations between 12,000-9,000 years ago.
