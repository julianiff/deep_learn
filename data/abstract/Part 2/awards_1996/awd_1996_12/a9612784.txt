Abstract    :
                The award is to support a planning workshop to develop a science plan for
              studies of the physical and biogeochemical interactions of Arctic Ocean
              shelves.  The Shelf Basin Interactions initiative to be developed by the
              workshop participants will identify a research program that may be conducted to
              address the question of the fate of organically derived material from the shelf
              that is transported to the deep basin in response to global change. The fate of
              the organic material must be determined in order to improve models for
              estimating the volume of carbon dioxide exchange with the atmosphere during
              global warming.  At present, the carbon exchange from shelf to basin is largely
              unknown in the Arctic Ocean and must be investigated if accurate estimates of
              the impact of global change on the climatically sensitive Arctic region is to
              be determined.  The workshop will produce a science plan for conducting a
              research program.
