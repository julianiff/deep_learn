               Title: Mutual Climatic Range Reconstructions of Late Quaternary  Climates in
              Beringia    The aim of this grant is to synthesize and quantify paleoclimate 
              reconstructions on the basis of fossil insect data from Eastern  Beringia
              (Alaska, the Yukon Territory) and the Bering Land Bridge  using the Mutual
              Climate Range (MCR) method.  The Quaternary insect  fossil record is a source
              of proxy data that provides sensitive,  accurate paleoclimatic reconstructions
              for terrestrial ecosystems.   As with any single source of proxy data, fossil
              insect  interpretations cannot provide the complete paleoenvironmental 
              picture.  This investigation will promote interdisciplinary  cooperation by
              generating calibrated, quantitative paleotemperature  data for fossil beetle
              assemblages that will be more readily  comparable to the reconstructions based
              on the interpretation of  other proxy data, such as pollen response surfaces
              and transfer  functions.  A principal objective of this investigation will be
              to  establish the nature, timing and intensity of the major climatic 
              transitions of the late Pleistocene.  Secondly, this method will be  applied in
              Eastern Beringia to calibrate existing data and provide  seasonal temperature
              reconstructions.
