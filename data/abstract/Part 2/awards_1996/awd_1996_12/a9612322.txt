              Illinois  Institute of Technology      This grant is awarded through the
              Separations and Purification Program subelement of the Interfacial, Transport
              and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division.  The
              principal investigator is Dr. Darsh Wasan of the Illinois Institute of
              Technology.  The objective of the research is to understand the underlying
              mechanisms behind the phenomenon of demulsification, where droplets of oil(or
              water) flocculate and eventually coalesce to form separate oil and water
              phases.  The research involves the development of novel techniques to measure
              characteristics of the demulsification process.  These include the development
              of a "surface force" apparatus based on differential  interferometry to measure
              film disjoining pressure, the development of interfacial rheometry and
              tensiometry, piezo-imaging spectroscopy to characterize film rupture and
              droplet coalescence, and hydroaccoustic spectroscopy to differentiate droplet
              flocculation from the coalescence.    Demulsification is a widely used process
              in the chemicals and petroleum industry. For   example, oil-recovery processes
              lead to the formation of emulsions, and demulsification   is important in
              separating the oil from water.  Emulsions formed in the cleanup of oil  spills
              and hazardous materials also need to be broken so that the chemical additives
              used in extraction can be recycled.  The phenomenon is complex and there is a
              need to understand the underlying scientific issues.
