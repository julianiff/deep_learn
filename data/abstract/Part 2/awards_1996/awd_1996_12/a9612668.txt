Abstract    :
              INT 9612668  Tiffney        This U.S.-Eastern Europe workshop on paleobotanical
              topics will precede the fifth "International Organization of Paleobotany"
              conference being held in Santa Barbara, California, during June 30-July 5,
              1996.  Organized by Dr. Bruce Tiffney of the University of California, Santa
              Barbara, the workshop will feature definition and development of new joint
              research projects between U.S. participants and counterpart Hungarian, Czech
              and Polish scientists who are attending the same conference.  The topics to be
              discussed will feature floristic evolution and biogeographical interchalge
              through geologic time. The workshop is expected to yield ideas for new
              collaborative research that will extend and promote the U.S. research
              community's access to unique geologic sites and paleobotanical expertise in
              Eastern Europe.  Resulting international research proposals will be considered
              by the National Science Foundation on a competitive basis.       ??
