Abstract    :
                    Abstract      EEC-9612305  Thomas    The power industry must undertake a
              managed redesign of the nations' power system so that is can adopt to rapid
              changes in the power requirements and economic conditions.  This planning grant
              is studying the feasibility of an Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center in Power Systems Engineering to address the research needed to create
              the tools and models to aid in the technical design of a future
              high-performance electric power systems.    The Center is envisioned to be a
              multi university consortium headquartered in Cornell University and involving
              the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Illinois, the
              University of Wisconsin - Madison, and Howard University.  The proposed
              research agenda addresses: 1) Real-Time Control: The Role of Data Calibration;
              2) Pserc Flagship Project: Simulation Tools for Analysis of Alternative
              paradigms for the new Electric Business; and 3) Power Web: Ann Internet
              Platform Simulating Competitive Bidding for Unit Commitment and Schedule.
