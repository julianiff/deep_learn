               Special Project:  A Proposal for Assistance in Attending:  ADMI '96-Building
              for the Future:  The Symposium on Computing at Minority Institutions    This
              grant provided travel  assistance for faculty and students from minority
              institutions to participate in the 1996 ADMI Symposium.  The 1996 Symposium
              incorporated major new themes: 1) to enable minority faculty to present papers
              on strategies for increasing the number of CISE-discipline students from
              underrepresented populations and to share these topics with  representatives
              from major research universities, and 2) to provide for inclusion of student
              participants, giving them valuable experience in presenting research papers and
              providing for their participation in graduate study workshops.  Participants
              were chosen by a selection committee following submission of their papers.  A
              Conference Proceedings is being published containing all of the papers
              presented at the conference.
