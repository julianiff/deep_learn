Abstract    :
              9612062  Vance   This award provides funding to develop a new and innovative
              approach to designing spatial mechanisms based on the use of virtual reality
              technology. A virtual environment, which can be entered using a variety of
              visual and interactive virtual reality devices, will be developed and used to
              design unique, novel spherical mechanisms. New analytical techniques of
              spherical mechanism design will be incorporated into the design software. In
              addition, this software will be used to perform an evaluation of the
              suitability of various virtual reality menu structures, interaction devices and
              display devices to the task of engineering product design. This development
              will be a testbed for the use of virtual reality in mechanical design.   If
              successful, this research will result in a computer tool that will provide a  
              three-dimensional design space where the designer can synthesize spherical
              mechanisms and obtain a sense of the form and function of the devices without
              having to build expensive physical prototypes after each design change. This
              would enable spatial mechanisms to be incorporated into many products,
              including manufacturing equipment and consumer products. The replacement of
              several planar mechanisms with one spherical mechanism would result in a design
              with fewer links, fewer driving motors, more reliability and lower cost. As a
              result of this research, new advances in the application of virtual reality
              technology to mechanical design and in the area of spherical mechanism design  
              methodology are likely.
