Abstract    :
              9612191  Erim  The objective of this study is to investigate the usefulness  of
              two state-of-the-art methods in the analysis of  electrical signals recorded
              from human muscles.  These  techniques are wavelet and time-frequency
              transforms, which  have yielded favorable results in data compression, 
              nonstationary signal analysis and noise removal; and fuzzy  logic which has
              been successfully employed in decision-  making and control fields. These
              methods will be applied to  two main problems encountered in the analysis of
              signals  recorded from muscles:  a) the identification of the  activities of
              individual muscle units represented in signals  recorded via needle electrodes,
              and b) the analysis of the  time-varying nature of signals recorded during
              dynamic  contractions via surface electrodes attached to the skin  over the
              muscle.  The availability of powerful analysis  tools will enhance the research
              in these fields geared  toward gaining a better understanding of the control of
               muscles by the central nervous system, as well as the  development of reliable
              diagnostic procedures to be used in  the clinical environment.  The initial
              year will be devoted  to the implementation of the techniques proposed to be 
              employed in the study, and to the application of these to  specific signals
              recorded from muscles.  It is hoped that  this year will serve to provide the
              principal investigator  with expertise in these new fields and help to
              establish her  as an independent researcher.  It is further hoped that the 
              work carried out during this year will produce the  preliminary results
              necessary to demonstrate the  applicability of the mentioned techniques to the 
              investigation of muscle signals, and that it will lead to  the proposal of at
              least one full-blown study structured  according to the findings and
              conclusions of the present  study.        ***
