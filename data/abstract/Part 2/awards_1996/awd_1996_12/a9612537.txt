Abstract    :
              9612537  Wang  This exploratory research addresses the area of high data
              recording density for computer and network recording applications and
              multi-media publishing.  The available CD-ROM type of optical data storage is
              not erasable and this proposal addresses the demonstration of feasibility in an
              erasable optical-disk storage with ion-exchanged glass disks.  This is an SGER
              award to characterize an ion-exchange glass disk and to demonstrate the laser
              heating effect for writing and the UV darkening of glass for erasing.  ***
