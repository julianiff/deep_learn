Abstract    :
              A novel regenerating filtration system for Diesel engines will be investigated. 
              The system consists of a rotating fluidized bed reactor with a variable speed
              that will collect soot during low power operations, and react the collected
              soot with NOx at high power operations where the temperature is sufficiently
              high.  The particulate catalyst acts as filter medium for soot retention and
              promoter of the NOx  reduction.  The operation of the catalyst is essential to
              the success of the filtration system.  Laboratory and pilot station experiments
              are planned.  A single catalyst granule model will be develop to be used as
              reference in conducting and interpreting the experiments.  A group of
              companies, including petroleum refining companies (Exxon, Mobil Technology
              Co.), catalyst manufacturers (Engelhard Co., Alcoa, Johnson Matthey) and Diesel
              engine manufacturers (Cummins, Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo) will collaborate to
              the project by providing support to experiments and technical feedback, and
              supplying partial funding. Industrial partners will provide in-kind
              contributions, participate to research, and support with funds the university
              research component, satisfying the requirements for a GOALI project.  NJIT will
              contribute 50% of the cost of equipment.  The NJIT team has the co-P.I.s from
              chemical engineering, chemistry, and mathematics.    Four programs have
              co-reviewed this proposal: Fluid, Particulate and Hydraulic Systems (FPHS), 
              Chemical Reaction Processes (CRP), Environmental Technologies (ET), and GOALI.
