Abstract    :
              This research projects deals with control of the start-up and  shut-down of
              boilers in uncertain time-varying systems such as  power plants using robust
              predictive control techniques and  localized time-frequency concepts.
              Specifically, it develops  strategies for synthesis of suboptimal robust
              controllers of  reduced computational complexity. Such control algorithms
              serves  as enabling technologies for the next generation  operating  regimes
              for power plants as well as a guide for the future  control-driven power plant
              designing and other complex mechanical  systems. The approach utilizes an
              extension of H-infinity  productive control methodology, and a method of
              evaluation and  representation of unmodeled plant dynamics to time varying
              case.  On this basis it develops a new time-frequency localized  framework for
              robust predictive control of time-varying plants  which utilizes the
              wavelet-based complexity reduction o the  computation of control laws, and
              reduction in controller  conservativeness due to the time-frequency localized 
              representation of model uncertainty.
