Abstract    :
              9612426  Tapia    Tapia is Noah Harding Professor of Mathematical Sciences,
              Associate  Director of Minority Affairs (Office of Graduate Studies), and 
              Director of Education and Minority Programs), Center for Research  in Parallel
              Computation (CRPC), at Rice University.  Tapia s  accomplishments include:     
              I.   Directing the advanced work of 28 students, including seven       minority
              students, in computational and applied mathematics;      II.  Overseeing the
              college careers of hundreds of minority       students, as Dean of Education
              and Minority Programs;      III. Originating a five-point program addressing
              minority education       issues at every level, from graduate recruitment to
              high       school awareness in his role at CPRC, an NSF Science and      
              Technology Center (STC) -- in less than a decade, he has       spearheaded a
              nationally recognized model educational outreach       program for minorities
              and women that has trained more than       575 students and 600 teachers in
              mathematics, science, and       engineering; this core of students, in turn,
              continues to       impact thousands of others;      IV.  Significantly
              impacting Rice University institutionally -- by       helping increase the
              minority percentage of Rice s freshman       class from less than 5% to
              approximately 15% over the past few       years; Rice has graduated the most
              minority Ph.D. students of       any mathematics department in the country;  14
              of 24 of       Tapia s Ph.D. or M.A. students have been minority;      V.  
              Being elected the first Mexican-American to the National       Academy of
              Engineering; voted by students as the 1991 winner       of Rice s George R.
              Brown Award for superior teaching; named       by the National Research Council
              (NRC) as one of the 20 most       influential leaders in minority mathematics
              education; awarded       the Hispanic Engineer National Achievement Award for
              Education       from the Society of Professional Hispanic Engineers; and      
              serves on the Board of Directors o f the Society for the       Advancement of
              Chicanos and Native Americans in Science.
