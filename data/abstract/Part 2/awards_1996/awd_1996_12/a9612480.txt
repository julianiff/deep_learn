Abstract    :
                  9612480  Jang  The effects of tool wear on surface texture generation in 
              diamond ultra-precision turning will be studied in order to  establish the
              relationships between tool wear progression  and the 3-D shape changes of the
              surface texture.  This will  be used as basis for development of control
              algorithms for  on-line evaluation and display of the surface texture and 
              development of an index for determining optimal tool changes  as well as for
              development of tools to be implemented in the  computer numeric controlled
              machining center.  ***
