Abstract    :
                    9612890  Valero     The Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) is an
              international field experiment with participation from France, Germany, India,
              the Netherlands, and the United States.  The main effort under the U.S.
              component focuses on assessing the role of sulfates and other continental
              aerosols in global radiative forcing and is being supported jointly by the
              Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation.  In addition,
              complementary studies involving investigations of a variety of related chemical
              and radiative processes will be undertaken by scientists from other federal
              agencies and other international partners.  The composite observing system
              consists of a wide range of platforms, from ships to aircraft, as well as
              surface-based and balloon measuring systems, and satellite data.  The main part
              of the three year effort will be a four-month intensive field phase which
              begins January 1999.     The ultimate goal of this program is to obtain a
              better understanding of the decadal and longer time scale climate forcing.  The
              equatorial Indian Ocean during the northeast winter monsoon season provides a
              unique natural laboratory for this experiment.  The experimental area is
              probably the only place in the world where an air mass which has been modified
              by intense sources of continental aerosols, anthropogenic trace species, and
              their reaction products (e.g., sulfates and ozone) from the northern hemisphere
              comes into contact with the pristine air of the southern hemisphere, which has
              been transported via cross equatorial monsoonal flow, at the Intertropical
              Convergence Zone.   The juxtaposition of these two very distinct air masses
              will allow a thorough examination of both the direct and indirect effects of
              the aerosols on the radiative properties of the atmosphere.     Dr. Valero's
              role in INDOEX is to quantify the radiative effects of aerosols by providing
              airborne, direct observations of spectral radiative fluxes, spectral optical
              depths and broadband irradiances.  This information , together with other
              observations that will be obtained during the experiment, will provide a means
              of evaluating the potential impact of aerosols on the climate.
