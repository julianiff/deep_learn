Abstract    :
              9612334  Lauffenburger  In spite of their efficient gene transfer capabilities, 
              current viral vectors fall short of ideal vector for  human in-vivo gene
              therapy.  Among the most serious  problems are the random gene insertion into
              the host  chromosome, immune responses caused by the natural  viral proteins,
              and low cell selectivity and efficiency  in the transfer.  Also, neither
              adenoviral nor  retrovial vectors can incorporate genes over 7 or 8 kb  in
              size.    There is a growing body of work demonstrating that  certain ligands
              have the ability to bind DNA and effect  its transfer into cells through very
              selective surface  receptor binding.  Thus conjugate gene delivery offers  and
              improved delivery potential but has not been  studied in enough detail to
              demonstrate feasibility.   For gene transfer use.    This proposal seeks to
              gain information on the rate-  limiting steps of the receptor-mediated
              DNA/ligand-  conjugate transport from the cell surface to the  nucleus. 
              Specific aims include: A. Determine whether  cellular internalization is a
              limiting factor; B.   Determine where in the endosomal sorting pathways 
              conjugates escape to the cytosol; C.  Predict and test  desirable ligand
              properties to effect the transfer.    The program will study the transfer of
              the epidermal  growth factor (EGF) gene into mouse fibroblast cells  that
              contain previously transfected EGF receptors.   This robust system will allow
              variation of all the key  factors.  The P.I.'s lab has extensive experience 
              working with the EGF system and has already  demonstrated reasonable success
              transferring EGF to the  mouse fibroblasts.  ***
