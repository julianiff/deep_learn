Abstract    :
              9612663  Rosen  This proposal is for the further investigation of a 
              relationship between the toxicity of various anionic  surfactants and certain
              of their physicochemical interfacial  properties discovered by the principal
              investigator and his  co-workers in a cooperative research project with the 
              Environmental Science Department of the Procter and Gamble  Company.  The
              proposed project is for an extension of that  investigation to other types of
              surfactants (cationic,  nonionic, and zwitterionic) and to mixture of
              surfactants,  with the aim of determining whether that relationship holds  also
              for these systems.  The physicochemical properties will  be calculated from
              surface tension measurements conducted in  the principal investigator's
              laboratory; the toxicity  measurements will be conducted by the Procter and
              Gamble  Company.  The surface tension measurements will be made on  solutions
              of the surfactants in water of the same pH and  electrolyte composition as that
              used for the toxicity  measurements.  In addition, other physicochemical 
              interfacial properties will be investigated for possible  correction with
              toxicity.  Since all of these  physicochemical properties have known
              relationships to the  chemical structure of the surfactant, the results of this
               project should provide guidelines for the selection or  design of surfactants
              with minimum environmental impact for  commercial use.  ***
