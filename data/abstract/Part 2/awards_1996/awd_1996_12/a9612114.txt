Abstract    :
              9612114  Wang  The Mathematics Department of Tulane University requests a
              partial   support for the 1996-1997 Clifford Lectures, which will be held in  
              November 1996. This will partially cover the expenses of speakers   and
              participating students and faculty who do not have grants. The  principal
              lecturer will be Professor Paul Fife of the University of   Utah, who will
              speak on "Mathematical issues in the dynamics of   phase transitions". The
              lectures, with their accompanying miniconference,   will bring lively
              interactions among scientists in applied analysis,   modeling and computation
              in material science and mathematical biology,   statistical physics as well as
              geometry. The conference will bring   mathematics of the highest quality to
              faculty and students from not   only at Tulane but also from Louisiana
              universities.    %%%  This proposal calls for support to organize a week long
              conference,  historically known as the Clifford Lecture series. The purpose of
              the   lecture series is to bring together researchers from many different
              fields  who have a common intersection on phase transition which is an active 
              area in the theoretical material science, statistical physics as   well as
              geometry. The topics to be covered represent some current   technological
              issues in phase transition. The theme of the workshop   includes a principal
              lecturer, followed by a mini conference. Student   participation is a strong
              component of the lecture series.  ***
