Abstract    :
                This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, 
              focusses on the electrochemical synthesis and characterization of complex 
              mixed metal oxide superconductor materials that exhibit novel properties.  
              These materials will be prepared from varying ratios of barium, potassium, 
              bismuth, and oxygen by Professor Michael Norton and his students in the 
              Department of Chemistry at Marshall University.  This group first developed 
              these methods for electrochemically preparing these materials which have 
              reduced defects that impart superior superconductor properties.  Vibrational 
              spectroscopy and optical and scanning tunnelling microscopies will be used to 
              characterize these superconductor materials.    Materials that function as
              superconductors at high temperatures exhibit novel  electronic and magnetic
              properties that hold promise for applications in a  wide range of electronic
              devices.  Procedures for preparing defect free  superconducting materials are
              necessary before these applications can be  realized.  Professor Michael Norton
              and his students in the Department of  Chemistry at Marshall University have
              developed a new electrochemical method  for preparing superconductor materials
              composed of barium, potassium, bismuth,  and oxygen.  This project will focus
              on further developing this unique  approach to the reliable preparation of high
              temperature superconductor  materials.
