Abstract    :
              ***  9612378  Ban   This Small Business Innovation Research Project is to design
              and build a radically new prototype reactor capable of deposition of OLED
              materials on large area substrates.  In Phase I a new method for the large
              area, low cost growth of organic light emitting devices (OLEDS) was
              successfully developed using a patented process of Organic Vapor Phase
              Deposition (OVPD).  The potential of OVPD was developed by producing an
              efficient green Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED), consisting of OVPD
              deposited TDP and vacuum deposited Alq3 films.  This represents the first step
              in large batch processing of "small molecule" and possibly polymer based OLEDS,
              devices of great importance for emissive color flat panel displays. This type
              of reactor can be scaled up to produce large area, full color flat panel
              displays continuously.  In Phase II the extensive expertise gained in OLED
              materials and reactor and process design expertise will be combined.   The
              commercial potential in this type of display market may be enormous (estimated
              at over $20 billion/year).  The technology proposed is unique in its approach
              to producing low cost OLED based flat panel displays in high volume.    ***
