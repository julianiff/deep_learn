Abstract    :
              9612003    Duffie   This research involves heterarchical manufacturing systems
              in which control is highly distributed among loosely-coupled autonomous
              entities that retain a minimal amount of global information.  The goal of this
              research is to establish a nonlinear dynamical systems theory for modeling and
              analysis of real-time distributed control in part-driven heterarchical
              manufacturing systems with batch sizes as low as unity and Just-In-Time
              production.  Major issues to be addressed are (1) innovative continuous
              feedback control topologies for general multiple machine configurations, (2)
              dynamical models that characterize the behavior of general multiple machine
              configurations, and (3) rigorous analysis of system dynamics including state
              trajectories, stability, steady-state values, convergence properties, and
              robustness.  Challenging research issues include modeling nonlinearities and
              analyzing system dynamics when there is more than one machine for a given
              processing step and when parts have to visit more than one such processing
              step.  Real-time scheduling performance and robustness to disturbances will be
              evaluated in the laboratory.   This research is novel and highly relevant to
              industry needs.  There are many non-trivial issues to surmount making this
              relatively high risk, but if successful, will represent major advances.
