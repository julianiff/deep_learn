Abstract    :
              9612636  Liu      This proposal deals with two important aspects in the emerging
               electric power industry environment: power engineering and  economics.  From a
              power engineering point of view, a new  challenge is to maintain the
              reliability of the power networks  given higher levels of uncertainties. 
              Traditionally, generation  units are owned and scheduled by the utilities. 
              However, in the  emerging environment, the available generation depend
              primarily  on the contracts established by various purchasing-selling  parties.
               Since a high reliability level has to be maintained for  the power systems,
              new techniques for operation and decision  making will be desirable. 
              Engineering constraints on the power  systems such as available transfer
              capabilities have to be met as  energy transactions are implemented.  The
              proposed research  incorporates power system engineering constraints into a
              contract  decision making method.  ***
