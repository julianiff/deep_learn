Abstract    :
              9612035    Fragmentation of rock is important for many applications in  rock 
              engineering.  The excavation of underground facilities is  increasingly  sought
              to accommodate the complex demands of today's  society, and it is  important to
              develop new ways to safely and cost-effectively  remove rock,  particularly
              hard rock.  Very few mechanical excavators have  been designed  to operate in
              hard rock, basically because of a lack of  knowledge of the  cutting process. 
              This research will lead to an improved  understanding of  the basic mechanisms
              involved in mechanical breakage of  rock, and will thus  ultimately contribute
              to improvements in the design and/or  mode of  operation of rock excavation
              machines.    The main objectives of the proposed research are to develop  (1)
              cuttability  criteria and (2) and index test to evaluate the ability to  cut
              rocks using  mechanical indentor-type tools (such as disk cutters used on 
              tunnel boring  machines, TBMs).  The essential mechanism involved in the 
              mechanical  breakage of rocks by indentation is the development of a  crushed
              zone as a  prelude to the formation of tensile cracks, which eventually  cause
              chipping  of the rock.  The existence of this crushed zone imposes  constraints
              on the  efficiency or even the ability to cut rocks by mechanical  means. 
              Indeed,  compressive damage of the rock beneath the indentor limits  the
              magnitude of  the compressive stress required to initiate and propagate 
              tensile cracks.  ***
