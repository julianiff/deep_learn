Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), jointly  funded by the Theory
              of Computing (TOC) Program, CCR, by  Computational Biology Activity, BIR and by
              the Systemic  Biology Program, DEB, addresses problems in the construction  of
              phylogenies or evolutionary trees.   The formulation and  effective solution of
              this problem requires a collaborative  multidisciplinary effort from
              biologists, statisticians and  computer scientists.   The ideal methodology for
              solving  this problem would include the following steps:(a) Observe  data on
              the species that exist today; (b) Identify a  biological model (such as the
              Jukes-Cantor model or Kimura  two parameter model); (c) Based on the model from
              Step (b),  design an objective function and efficient optimization  methods for
              this function so that the tree that optimizes  this objective function is the
              tree that best fits the  model. Unfortunately, this ideal program is impossible
              to  realize, because of roadblocks at every step: (i) Data is  subject to
              experimental error and to errors due to its  interpretation and use in
              phylogeny construction  methods;(ii) It seems difficult to identify a precise 
              biological model for evolution; (iii) Given the stochastic  model of evolution,
              one candidate for the optimizing tree is  the ``most likely tree''.  Given the
              uncertainty of what is  actually the ``best'' model, a most likely tree under
              one  model should still be a very likely tree under a slightly  different
              model.   Demonstrating this has proven to be a  very difficult problem.  The
              goals of this SGER proposal  include:(1) Modification of the ideal methodology
              so that  Difficulties(i) -- (iii) are removed; (2) Testing of various  models
              using r-RNA and tufA sequence data supplied by a  molecular biologist; (3)
              Using the experimental results,  design of general methods for inferring
              phylogeny;(4)  Comparison of these new models with existing models for the 
              data.  In addition, one of the goals of this SGER award is  to initiate a
              multidisciplinary effort  between the  biologists, statisticians, and computer
              scientists at the  University of Pennsylvania.***
