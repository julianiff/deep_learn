Abstract    :
              Spatial heterodyne spectroscopy (SHS), a relatively new and undeveloped
              spectroscopic method, has fundamental advantages over its relative, Fourier
              transform spectroscopy (FTS).  In SHS, diffraction gratings replace the flat
              mirrors used in each arm of a conventional Michelson, and an imaging detector
              is used at the output to record a spatially heterodyned interferogram without
              any scanning elements.  The PIs have achieved an additional light-gathering
              gain of about 150 over conventional FTS or Fabry-Perot interference
              spectrometers with their SHS system.  These gains translate into smaller
              instruments and higher sensitivity for a specified application.  Their work
              will focus on atmospheric remote sensing problems.  The investigators will
              fully design a field-widened system suitable for monitoring the global
              distribution of middle atmospheric OH from space; further, they anticipate
              performing ground-based testing on a large telescope.
