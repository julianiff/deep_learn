Abstract    :
              IRI-9612357  This award, in the SGER mode, funds a 24 month exploration  of the
              potential uses of an electronic "bridle" mounted on  an insect to control its
              locomotion.  The investigation  combines research in robotic control and
              sensing,  neurobiology, and microelectromechanical systems  engineering, to
              instrument large insects in such a fashion  that signals analogous to those of
              a laboratory robot may be  sensed and commanded at will.  The research in this 
              exploration period involves a study of the control  strategies used in
              regulating locomotion, including neural  correlates to the locomotion control. 
              Using a combination  of empirically and theoretically derived models, the 
              investigators will attempt to "reverse engineer" the working  behavior of the
              insect, a Madagascar cockroach, to the point  of proposing automatic control
              strategies that can be  implemented on the animal via external stimulus, so
              that the  animal's path and gait can be guided and controlled by human  or
              machine command.
