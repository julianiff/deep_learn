Abstract    :
              9612300   Devasia   The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) is one of the
              important nanofabrication tools used for precision lithography of structures
              below 100 nm.  As a manufacturing tool, high precision is achieved at the
              expense of throughput using low scanning speeds.  This project will improve
              throughput by developing the theoretical and experimental expertise needed for
              high-speed/high-precision scanning probes for STM.  The technical approach uses
              nonlinear inversion of the piezo actuator dynamics for scan path tracking, and
              feedback to handle the modeling errors.  The four theoretical and experimental
              parts of the research are: (1) piezo modeling and order reduction, (2)
              inversion-based control design, (3) high speed scan path design using the
              inversion based control to minimize vibration, and (4) feedback control to
              stabilize the scan path and reduce errors attributed to unmodeled dynamics.    
                Success of this project will increase the productivity of current
              microelectronics fabrication equipment, and will enable the design of the next
              generation of machines needed for positioning below 10 nm.  This will allow the
              fabrication of higher performance microelectronic devices at lower cost.
