Abstract    :
              9612344   Storm    This  grant  supports  a  conference  on  the  modeling   of 
              materials and microstructure aimed at prediction of  optimal  properties  and 
              performance.   Scientific  subjects  to  be  discussed  relate  to  issues  in 
              manufacturing,  continuum  models,  quantitative analysis of microstructure,
              prediction  of  materials  properties, modeling  of  defects,  atomistic 
              models,  and microstructural evolution.  Scientific  experts  address  these
              topics and the related modeling to develop  a  cross-fertilization  of  ideas. 
              The  Gordon  Conference  on  Physical  Metallurgy is held biannually.  The
              $5.1K supports  young researchers to attend the meeting.  %%%  Optimum  
              synthesis  and  processing  of  complex  materials  requires  knowledge of the
              effects of materials  composition  and  structure on properties and
              performance.  This  demands  continued  efforts on combined modeling and 
              experimentation  to develop predictive capabilities in these areas.  ***
