Abstract    :
              a9612203  Lilley                This project is a rapid response to a
              hydrothermal/volcanic  event on the Gorda Ridge in the northeast Pacific.  On
              28 Feb. 1996  a major seismic event was detected by the NOAA VENTS program 
              through monitoring of the US Navy SOSUS hydrophone arrays. NOAA  dispatched the
              research vessel MacArthur and they discovered a  hydrothermal megaplume in the
              area of the seismic activity.  The  availability of the research vessel Wecoma
              in early April allow a  more detailed response.  The objectives of this cruise
              are to  locate the source of the magaplume, to determine whether there has 
              been a subsurface bacterial bloom, to determine geochemical and  microbial
              concentrations in the plume, and, if possible, to  establish patterns of
              crustal breakage and/or eruption.
