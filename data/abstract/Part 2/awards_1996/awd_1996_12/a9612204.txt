              Title:  Soft X-ray Sources and Optics for High Spatial, Temporal and Spectral
              Resolution Interferometry      Abstract:    The research focuses on the
              construction and application of a high resolution (25 nm) X-ray microscope to
              problems in lithography and biology. The instrument will be suitable either for
              scanning or imaging microscopy and has the potential of enabling single shot
              imaging of biological samples without distortion of the samples.
