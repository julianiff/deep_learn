Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Frankel  9612527      The proposal is to partially fund a workshop on
              Boundary Element Technology. This numerical technique has wide applicability in
              diverse areas of engineering, including heat transfer, fluid mechanics,
              electromagnetics, and stress analysis.  Within heat transfer, applications
              include inverse conduction, melting, and radiative transport. The proposed
              workshop is the 12th in a series of International meetings on boundary element
              technology and is jointly sponsored by the University of Tennesee and the
              Wessex Institute of Technology in the United Kingdom.
