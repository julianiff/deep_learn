Abstract    :
              The investigators will combine coincident ground-based optical and radar data to
              simultaneously specify the average energy and energy flux of precipitating
              electrons and the resulting changes in the atomic oxygen concentration. The
              investigators will use data from past experimental campaigns at Sondre
              Stromfjord, Greenland, including electron densities measured by the incoherent
              scatter radar, zenith intensities of key emission features measured by
              multi-channel photometers, winds inferred from Fabry-Perot interferometer
              measurements, images from an all-sky camera, magnetic field variations from a
              chain of ground-based magnetometers, and data from polar-orbiting satellites.
              They will correlate time variations in atomic oxygen with the particle and
              Joule heating rates, estimated from models and coincident satellite and
              ground-based magnetometer data. These data will be used to study the
              thermospheric response to particle and Joule heating, plasma characteristics of
              pre-energized auroral electrons, production and loss associated with observed
              optical emission features, and populations and relative transition rates also
              associated with these emission features.
