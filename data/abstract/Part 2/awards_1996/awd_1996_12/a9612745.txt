Abstract    :
              9612745  BEAVIS  Recently, there have been tremendous advances in understanding
              the molecular mechanisms underlying traits that are controlled by single genes.
               This knowledge has come from methods developed by molecular biologists. 
              However, most human diseases and virtually all economically important traits in
              natural and domesticated species are controlled by multiple genes with complex
              interactions among genetic and environmental factors.  Historically, knowledge
              about the genetics underlying such traits has come from statistical methods
              developed by quantitative geneticists.  The purpose of this Gordon Research
              Conference on Quantitative Genetics and Biotechnology is to promote exchange of
              information between scientists trained in molecular biology with those trained
              in quantitative genetics. It is one of the few meetings that brings together
              the specific mix of disciplines of evolutionary biology, human genetics, and
              plant and animal breeding.  This type of meeting is a valuable means of
              disseminating information and ideas to an extent that could not be achieved
              through the usual channels of publication and presentation at large scientific
              meetings. Funds from NSF pay for travel costs for invited participants.  This
              conference will provide insights into uses and limitations of various research
              tools that are not obvious in the individual disciplines.  In addition,
              molecular biologists and quantitative geneticists form collaborations among
              laboratories.  These synergistic collaborations have contributed to
              understanding the genetic basis of complex traits and evolutionary
              relationships in many organisms.  This information will result in the
              development of treatments for human diseases as well as in more productive
              agricultural products.
