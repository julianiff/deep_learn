Abstract    :
              9706393    This award is for a research symposium on the impact of  information
              technology on disaster mitigation and  management.  The symposium will examine
              the current state of  information technology in disaster management practice
              and  identify possible ways to improve or increase  interorganizational and
              interjurisdictional performance  through appropriate uses and new applications
              of such  technology.  Specific objectives of the symposium include a 
              demonstration of the application of a prototype distributed,  intelligent,
              spatial information system to a set of  simulated problems in disaster
              mitigation and response, and  the development of a set of recommendations for
              action  regarding the integration of information technology into  disaster
              mitigation and management practice.  Symposium  participants will include both
              researchers and  practitioners.  ***
