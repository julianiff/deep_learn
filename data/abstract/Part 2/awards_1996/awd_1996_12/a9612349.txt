Abstract    :
              This project will launch a systematic theoretical investigation of
              micro-mesoscale ion evolutionary phenomena in the Earth's ionosphere and
              magnetosphere.  Important space plasma research problems in coming years will
              be addressed toward global issues.  In-situ observations are becoming
              multi-spacecraft in scope, and theoretical models are being forced to confront
              issues of nonlocality and multiscale interactions.  Investigators encounter
              microscopic processes, such as wave-particle interactions and macroscopic
              effects connected with large electric and magnetic fields, where
              inhomogeneities and flow are important.  This research has been aimed at
              understanding charged particle energization, diffusion and transport phenomena
              occurring at both micro- and mesoscales.  Specifically, the PI will continue
              his studies of the auroral ion acceleration problem, the production of
              counterstreaming electrons, the nonlocal generation, propagation and saturation
              of plasma turbulence, mesoscale resonant wave-particle interactions, and mode
              conversion and mode-mode coupling processes.
