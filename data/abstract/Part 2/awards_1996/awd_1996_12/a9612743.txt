Abstract    :
              This project installs a new MF radar in the subtropical southern hemisphere and
              for use in correlative studies of large-scale dynamics of the equatorial and
              global mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT).  The radar, located at a
              southern hemisphere site conjugate to a similar system operating in Hawaii,
              would provide sensitivity to atmospheric tidal structures in a location with no
              present measurement capabilities.  The PI will use data from new and existing
              radars to examine interhemispheric tidal structure and variability, tidal
              responses to source variations in the lower atmosphere, and global structure
              and zonal wave numbers of other planetary-scale motions in the MLT.  Analyses
              of equatorial and subtropical tidal variability closely link to parallel
              numerical studies of the atmospheric responses to local tidal forcing, enabling
              a quantitative understanding of the causes of tidal variability.
