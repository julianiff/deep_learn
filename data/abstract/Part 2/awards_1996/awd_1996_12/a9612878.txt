Abstract    :
              9612878  Guggenheim    This grant provides $48,355 as one-half support of the
              costs of  upgrading the single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
              instruments at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  Upgrades  to the single
              crystal instrument would include a new precession  camera, automation software
              and a new workstation to process X-  ray images.  Upgrades to the powder XRD
              instrument would include  automation software which requires a PC platform, a
              thin film  attachment, a new camera and a water recirculator and new X-ray 
              tube.  Upgrades to these instrument were well justified and will  allow
              continued productive research on phyllosilicate mineralogy  and crystallography
              over a wide range of temperatures and  pressures, studies of the
              adsorption/desorption reactions between  organic molecules and clay minerals,
              experimental petrology of  carbonate-aqueous fluid interactions, studies of the
              kinetics of  manganese oxide dissolution as a result of interactions with 
              organic compounds in waste waters, characterization of  semiconductor surfaces
              and characterization of catalysts.  These upgrades will therefore benefit a
              wide range of research  conducted both by departmental faculty and by faculty
              from the  Departments of Physics, Chemistry, and Chemical Engineering as  well
              as by regional users.  ***
