Abstract    :
              The PIs will develop a novel middle atmosphere temperature lidar that uses
              broadband tunable solid-state lasers and mesospheric iron as the fluorescence
              tracer.  This system will be rugged and reliable, capable of making
              observations day and night, and capable of being deployed at remote sites or
              operated from research aircraft.  After its construction, the system will
              characterize the thermal structure of the middle atmosphere to study iron and
              calcium in the mesopause region, and study the influence of tides and planetary
              waves.  These observations will substantially improve the limited knowledge of
              middle atmosphere temperatures, quantify the natural variability, provide
              crucial tests of middle atmosphere circulation models, and significantly
              enhance understanding of large scale waves and tides in this region.  Finally,
              the Arctic temperature observations planned will be the first made of the
              mesopause region at extreme high latitudes.
