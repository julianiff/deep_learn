Abstract    :
              This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, seeks
              to create, stimulate, and sustain interest in  science among sophomore and
              junior level high school students by  providing them the opportunity to take an
              intense, college-level  lecture and laboratory course in analytical chemistry. 
               Professors Mildred Smalley and Robert Miller of the Department of  Chemistry
              at Southern University in Baton Rouge will lead a  course for approximately
              sixteen high school students with  assistance from two high school chemistry
              teachers.  The course  will use problems in environmental chemistry to
              illustrate  principles of analytical chemistry and to convey to these  students
              a sense of the excitement that is attendant to careers  in chemistry.  This
              project is aimed at attracting  underrepresented minority student into
              successful careers in  science.  An intense college-level course in
              environmental analytical  chemistry will be made available on a competitive
              basis for some  sixteen high school sophomores and juniors from the Baton Rouge
               area.  Two high school chemistry teachers will serve as teaching  assistants
              in this course.  Particular attention is given to  attracting underrepresented
              minority students to science pursuits  and to enhancing the likelihood of their
              future success in  scientific careers.
