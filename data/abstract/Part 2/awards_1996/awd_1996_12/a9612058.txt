Abstract    :
              DMI-9612058  Miaoulis   The microscale effects are pertinent to thermal
              processing of microelectronic devices which requires careful control of the
              temperature distribution of the wafer.  These effects play a significant role
              in material processing when the wavelength of radiation is of the same order of
              magnitude as the layer/film thickness or feature sizes of the material
              processed.  Thermal problems lead to defect generation and propagation in the
              material, excessive diffusion of microelectronics features, and non-uniform
              film deposition.  As these devices become smaller and smaller, these issues
              become increasingly critical to the future of electronic materials
              manufacturing.  The semiconductor industry, in particular, the manufacturing
              equipment sector, is in need of a thorough understanding of these phenomena. 
              This research project will develop a set of simulation and experimental tools
              and techniques to examine the microscale radiative phenomena and to develop a
              novel temperature and stress measurement system.   The outcomes of the study
              would yield useful tools and models for sub-micro patterned wafers
              manufacturing.  The study will be conducted based on a 
              microelectricalmechanical (MEMS) approach.  This project is a collaboration
              between the Thermal Analysis of Materials Processing Laboratory of Tufts
              University and the Microfabrication Laboratory of the Northeastern University.
