Abstract    :
              A request has been made for funding to help offset the cost of travel, living
              expenses and registration fees for US participants in a joint US-France
              workshop on premixed turbulent combustion.  This workshop will focus on the
              study, structure, modeling and simulation of the flamelet regime associated
              with premixed turbulent combustion, and will bring together the leading experts
              in this field in the US and France.  The workshop will attempt to develop a
              consensus view of the current state of knowledge and of where research efforts
              should be directed.  This is a timely request since the need to understand
              premixed turbulent combustion is becoming more and more important because it
              offers the possibility of better control of combustion generated pollution and
              the mitigation of the resulting environmental problems.  This meeting is to be
              held on December 7, 8, 1996 in Hilton Head, SC.
