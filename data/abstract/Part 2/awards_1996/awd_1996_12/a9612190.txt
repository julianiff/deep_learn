Abstract    :
              9612190  Murphey   This Grant Opportunity  for Academic Liaison with Industry
              cooperative research project between the University of Michigan-Dearborn and
              Ford will provide new ways to do end of line test and fault identification in
              automobile manufacture.  Vacuum leaks, transmission shift, idle quality and
              axle ratio are the variables that the diagnostic system will consider, with the
              constraints that diagnostic methods must use existing sensors and be executed
              quickly.   The technical approach will use a distributed architecture with
              diagnostic agents for each potential fault.   A central agent will evaluate the
              results from each diagnostic agent, taking into account interactions between
              faults.  The decision making and classification approach uses fuzzy logic, with
              membership functions based on engineering heuristics, the easy-out rules
              applicable for the majority of vehicles, and complex fuzzy rules to refine and
              identify the specific faults.  Implementation and testing will use real data
              provide by Ford to the University of Michigan-Dearborn, then move to a test
              cell at Ford, finally migrating to plant operation.       The strength of this
              proposal is the significant industry commitment and participation, and the
              potential to bridge a technical gap between fuzzy systems and neural networks
              by focusing on this important diagnostic problem.  The architecture of
              distributed agent based fuzzy systems for diagnostics can be transferred to
              other applications, improving quality and reliability of manufactured products.
