Abstract    :
              9612646  Matthews    Established over thirty years ago, the Double Discovery
              Center  (DDC) was designed with the assistance of University faculty to 
              address the lack of formal science, mathematics and technology  education faced
              by many of the young people who enroll in DDC.  DDC s strengths include:     
              Inclusion of a science and technology curriculum among program    offerings
              with which students from Harlem schools can strengthen    preparation for
              college; this curriculum broadens students     grasp of career potentials in
              SEM fields and students are    required to complete specific courses in
              mathematics and    science;        Strong parental involvement;         Number
              and diversity of students served -- currently serves over    1,000 minority
              students over the age of twelve (12) annually,    approximately 75% of whom
              come from low income and first    generation college backgrounds;       
              Success of students mentored -- 97% high school graduation rate    (with an
              average number of 186 high school seniors); 98% college    enrollment rate
              compared to the national enrollment rate of 66%;     88% retention rate and 66%
              college graduation rate versus the    national rate of 58%;        Special
              opportunities for students -- academic research    experiences, academic
              support systems; and strategies leading to    successful matriculation and
              degree completion in science,    mathematics, and engineering fields; and      
               Demonstrated quality of institutional life fostering viable    learning,
              contacts, and career development networks -- creation    of an impressive
              network between parents and students and    administrators, alumni, faculty and
              students at Columbia    University.
