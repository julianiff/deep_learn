Abstract    :
              This project will measure vertical neutral atmospheric motions in the F-region
              using existing Fabry-Perot interferometers, by observing the atomic oxygen red
              line emissions from the ionosphere.  To calibrate the FPI for velocity, the PIs
              will produce and evaluate a zero velocity reference standard for use with
              Fabry-Perot interferometers.  First, the PI will build a new laboratory 630 nm
              lamp at the University of Pittsburgh, and compare it with various secondary
              reference sources at Millstone Hill.  The comparison between the oxygen lamp
              and the secondary sources will determine the effective velocity difference
              between the lamp and the ionospheric red line.  Once secondary standards have
              been calibrated, the PI will acquire and analyze data using existing FPIs along
              with these standards, measuring vertical motions by a long series of
              observations.
