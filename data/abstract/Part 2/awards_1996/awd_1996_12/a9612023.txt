Abstract    :
              The project will refine and evaluate a design for a 100 Teraops multiprocessor
              system organized as a hierarchy of processors-and-memory system subsystem
              (HPAM) by carefully considering its technological feasibility along with the
              usability of the programming environment, in the context of important
              representative applications. A programming environment capable of supporting a
              combination of automatic translation of standard programs, user-specified
              machine specific programs or optimizations, and library-based programming is to
              be investigated.  Two classes of applications will be considered:
              time-constrained, fixed-size problems and large-scale, complex problems.  The
              first consists of scientific simulations used with interactive immersive
              visualization systems.  The second includes the recently introduced SPEChpc96
              benchmarks and 2D/3D finite-element modeling applications.
