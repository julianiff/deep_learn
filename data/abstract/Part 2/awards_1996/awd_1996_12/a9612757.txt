Abstract    :
              This proposal aims to establish a royalty-free, national compiler infrastructure
              that serves the needs of the research community and industry.  A successful
              infrastructure will have a major impact on computing .  The availability of
              such a system will make compiler research and development more accessible to a
              larger community, and the system itself can form the basis of a modern compiler
              for commercial use.  The investment in this infrastructure is expected to be
              greatly amplified through community participation.  As a focal point to bring
              together all the talents in the compiler area, the infrastructure can develop
              into a super-system that surpasses any existing system.  Such an infrastructure
              can bring about the kind of acceleration in compiler development needed to
              match the phenomenal advances in processor architectures.  The proposed
              infrastructure includes robust front ends and back ends, as well as many
              different state-of -the-art program analyses and optimizations.
