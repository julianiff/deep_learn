              I.   Demonstrated significant outcomes:       -- 95% graduation rate in
              science;       -- high grade-point average:  3.4 for 180 currently enrolled    
                             students; and       -- 90% matriculation to graduate and

              Hopkins  Universities;    I.   Provided significant research-related summer
              internships in       laboratories throughout the U.S. and abroad (e.g., Yale,  
                  Colorado, NIH, A.T.&T Bell Labs, and Silicon Graphics;      II.  Secured
              substantial external support (over $9 million) from       numerous federal

               Hrabowski has made numerous presentations and co-authored numerous 
              publications about the issue of diversity and received many awards  for
              outstanding achievement in science education (including NSF,  Eli Lily
