Abstract    :
              9612368  Butler    Funding is provided to continue the work of the IRIS/JOI
              Cable   Steering Committee (CSC) and for continuing operation of the   TPC-1
              Cable which runs from Guam to Nimomiya, Japan.  The CSC   also provides
              coordination with other national and international   groups, technical advice
              to existing and planned cable programs,   and outreach to the broad scientific
              community. The coordination   role has three facets: liaison with national and
              international   groups for which cable applications are pertinent, specific  
              liaison with the extensive Japanese cable program, and regular   contact with
              industry and industrial organizations. The purpose   is to ensure that cable
              applications to long-term seafloor   observations are treated in a technically
              accurate manner and   that interested investigators around the world are aware
              of   ongoing or planned scientific programs which involve submarine   cables.
