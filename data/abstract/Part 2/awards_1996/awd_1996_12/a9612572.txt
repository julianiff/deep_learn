Abstract    :
                     Much AI work in planning uses deduction to draw  conclusions about the
              future, so that the inferences work  forwards in time from preconditions to
              consequences of  actions. This project is developing an alternative approach 
              in which the direction of reasoning is independent of  temporal direction, so
              that information may have onsequences  in the past or in the futre. It is based
              on an ontological  framework of pieces of space-time with 'natural' boundaries.
               The role of inference is also somewhat different; its  purpose here is to
              provide an efficient source of  explanations' for apparent anomalies in
              tentative partial  plans.  Planning - even if only of a simple kind - is of 
              central importance in many AI applications, but has suffered  from some
              stubborn theoretical difficulties; this lternative  approach seems to provide a
              solution to the 'frame problem'  and the 'prediction problem', both of which
              can be seen to  arise from identifying temporal direction with direction of 
              inference.
