Abstract    :
              ***  9612214  Indeck        This research program will construct a novel theory
              of innovation through an application of current cognitive models of creativity
              and an application of institutional economics.  Cognitive science has posited
              certain recurring skills in unusually creative people.  Institutional economics
              teaches that many non-technical factors influence innovation, product choice
              and marketability.  Although cognitive scientists and institutional economists
              have independently examined how innovation is fostered or constrained, this
              project will combine these disciplines for the first time in a study of the
              actual process of technical innovation in the magnetic storage industry.  A
              theory will be developed to describe this innovation that is expected to be
              valuable to other high technology industries such as semiconductors,
              electronics and pharmaceuticals to enhance the effectiveness of their
              innovation process.        This research program will foster innovation in the
              magnetic storage industry that has been defined by the federal government as
              crucial to US international economic competitiveness.  This industry that has
              been highly successful in the face of worldwide competition, should benefit
              substantially from these process enhancements.    ***
