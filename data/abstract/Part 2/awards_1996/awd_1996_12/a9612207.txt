Abstract    :
              In this project, part of the Cross-Directorate program for   Multidisciplinary
              Research in Optical Science and Engineering, William   Stwalley and colleagues
              at the University of Connecticut will extend   optical and other physical
              techniques for control and manipulation of   atoms and atomic ions, such as
              cooling and trapping, to molecules and   molecular ions for studies of
              ultracold chemical reactions and inelastic   collisions.  Such ultracold
              collision dynamics, at temperatures near   0.001 K, are virtually unexplored,
              but they are predicted to show extreme   quantum behavior which is highly
              sensitive to details of the   interactions, including the collision energy and
              quantum states involved.    Ultracold molecules will be formed by
              photoassociation of ultracold   atoms.  Chemical reactions, such as between a
              cryogenic beam of molecular   hydrogen and laser-cooled cesium atoms, will be
              explored in both the cold   and ultracold regimes, that is, at temperatures
              less than 10 K and 1 mK,   respectively.    The techniques of laser
              manipulation, which have proven so fruitful with   atoms, will be extended to
              allow investigations involving molecules and   molecular ions.  Novel chemical
              processes and physical behavior are   expected to be found in the ultracold
              temperature region examined in this   program.  This interdisciplinary research
              will have significant   educational impact at several levels.
