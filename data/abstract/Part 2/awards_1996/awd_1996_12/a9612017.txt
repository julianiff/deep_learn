Abstract    :
              9612017   Micromechanics is the study of how the microstructure of a material
              affects its microscopic response.  It provides the understanding necessary to
              develop simplified models for design and preliminary analysis.  Currently the
              ability of industry to use micromechanics is limited by the tools available for
              materials.  To facilitate this understanding, means of comparing
              micromechanical theories to experiments is required.  The research addresses
              these issues with a unique combination of advanced electron microscopy
              techniques, image processing technologies, and large scale/massively parallel
              nonlinear finite element methods.  Analyses of the representative volume
              element (RVE) are used to compare micromechanical theories to experiments.  
              The micromechanical modeling of the microstructures is conducted in
              collaboration with researchers at Alcoa.  This project has a balance between
              theory and experiment.  The collaboration with industry will ensure the
              research issues are realistically addressed.
