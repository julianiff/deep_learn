Abstract    :
                This award provided travel support for a workshop on the  topic of synergy
              between software engineering and  programming language research. The workshop
              was held June 12-  13 in Boston, MA, in juxtaposition with a Computing Research
               Association and ACM symposium on strategic directions in  computing, June
              14-15,  in the same location. The software  engineering and programming
              language workshop also received  partial funding from ARO.  ***
