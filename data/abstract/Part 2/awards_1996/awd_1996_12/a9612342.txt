Abstract    :
                The Foundation for Independent Higher Education requests support from NSF to
              connect fifteen of their member institutions of higher education to the
              Internet.  These include:  Concordia, Portland, OR, Converse College,
              Spartanburg, SC, Delaware Valley College, Doylestown, PA, Oglethorpe
              University, Atlanta, GA, Regis College, Weston, MA, Rosemont, Rosemont, PA,
              Thiel College, Greenville, PA, University of Mary, Bismarck, ND Voorhees
              College, Denmark, SC, Valley Forge Military Academy & College, Wayne, PA, FIHE
              Office, Chicago, IL, Alice Lloyd College, Pippa Passes, KY, Bellarmine College,
              Louisville, KY, Union College, Barbourville, KY, and Pikeville College,
              Pikesville, KY. Each of the institutions funded will connect to the Internet
              using service providers in within their respective areas.    These institutions
              of higher education need the Internet connections to be able to access
              information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world.  The
              connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of these institutions as
              well as the  community in general.
