Abstract    :
              Advances in technology have made it possible to integrate a processor core, a 
              program ROM, and application-specific circuitry all on a single IC.  Thus, 
              high-level language compilers are essential tools for overcoming complexity in 
              embedded system design.  This research is on development of a retargetable 
              compiler framework that can generate optimized code for a variety of processor 
              architectures.  The approach includes development of a machine description 
              language to describe a wide range of processor architectures.  Further tasks 
              include:  building a retargetable code generator and optimizer, and a simulator
               for the compiled code to obtain performance metrics.  Very general code 
              optimization algorithms that are parameterizable with respect to the number of 
              functional units, registers, and the topology of interconnect between them are 
              being explored.  The developed algorithms are being integrated into a framework
               for machine-dependent code generation and optimization.
