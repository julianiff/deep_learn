Abstract    :
              Boston College  The starter grant award to Boston College supports the research
              of   Professor Scott J. Miller.  The research focuses on the design and  
              synthesis of systems for the de novo asymmetric synthesis of amino acid  
              derivatives based on the principle of deracemization.  Using the   methodology
              of asymmetric organic synthesis, rapidly epimerizing   alpha-lactams are
              subjected to reactions with optically pure reagents.    Differential rates of
              reaction of each alpha-lactam enantiomer with the   chiral reagent result in
              the dynamic resolution of racemic mixtures to   allow for complete conversion
              to optically pure products.    This research will provide a new reaction
              methodology for synthesis of an   important class of natural and unnatural
              products; namely, optically   active amino acids and peptides.  The work
              advances not only the field of   asymmetric synthesis, but also artificial
              enzyme design and medicinal   chemistry through improved acess to important
              molecular building blocks.
