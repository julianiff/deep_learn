Abstract    :
                Abstract  CTS-9612747  C. Rogers  Tufts University    The main objective is to
              measure statistical properties of turbulence as seen by a particle suspended in
              air flow, and to determine the mechanisms responsible for particle dispersion. 
              A combined experimental-numerical approach is suggested to determine the fluid
              turbulence in the reference frame of a moving particle.  A two-component laser
              Doppler velocimeter (LDV) measure the instantaneous fluid velocity, then one
              calculates the acceleration of  an imaginary particle, and the LDV  measuring
              volume follows that particle.  The instantaneous vorticity and energy
              dissipation rate in the fluid.  The turbulence length scales and the dispersion
              characteristics are estimated using digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). 
               The investigation will include low and moderate Reynolds number flows, in
              forced and unforced turbulence situations, with relevance for two- and
              three-dimensional flows.  This a collaborative project between Prof. C, Rogers
              of Tufts University and Prof. J. Eaton and one of his students at Stanford
              University who will collaborate particularly in the direct numerical simulation
              of particle-laden flows.  Several sets of experiments will be performed
              concerning preferential particle concentration near-isotropic turbulence,
              particle concentration and directed particle motion in a separated shear layer.
               Improved fundamental understanding of fluid turbulence-particle interaction is
              expected.
