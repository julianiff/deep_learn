Abstract    :
              The PI will make detailed comparisons of theoretical model predictions with
              comprehensive data sets collected during CEDAR-HLPS high-latitude observational
              campaigns and routine observations.  The three areas emphasized involve
              sun-aligned polar cap arcs, the effects of thermospheric gravity waves on the
              high-latitude ionosphere, and the spatial and temporal resolution needed to
              elucidate the dynamics of thermospheric and ionospheric structures.  First, the
              researchers will quantitatively test theoretical predictions concerning the
              relationship between spacing between multiple polar cap arcs and the hardness
              of the arc precipitation.  Next, they will determine the spatial and temporal
              resolutions needed with regard to convection, precipitation, and current
              patterns in order to correctly elucidate the dynamics of thermospheric and
              ionospheric structures.  Successful completion of all these tasks will enhance
              knowledge of fundamental magnetosphere-ionosphere and thermosphere-ionosphere
              coupling processes.
