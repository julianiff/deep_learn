Abstract    :
                9612252  Moerner  This multidisciplinary research project utilizes advanced
              optical  science methodology to probe individual molecules or ions to  explore
              quantum properties and interactions with their local  environments, and to
              study the mechanochemical cycle and dynamics  of naturally occurring molecular
              motor proteins of the kinesin  super family.  Low temperature spectroscopy,
              plasmon resonant  probes, Raman scattering, and transmission electron
              microscopy  techniques are also included in a broad-based study to gain new 
              knowledge and understanding about the properties of matter and  molecular
              motors.  %%%  The project combines concepts and methodologies from condensed 
              matter physics, biochemistry and chemistry with advanced optical  probes and
              related characterization tools to address forefront  issues at the interfaces
              between these disciplines.  The research  will contribute basic new knowledge
              at a fundamental level to  several aspects of matter and molecular structures
              and  configurations.  An important feature of the program is the  integration
              of research and education through the training of  students in fundamental
              interdisciplinary research areas.  ***
