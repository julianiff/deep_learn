Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9612468  STINNER    Management of pest species in agricultural
              environments has become highly technical since the introduction of synthetic
              chemicals as pesticides.  The judicious use of these chemical tools, integrated
              with cultural, mechanical and biological controls to minimize effects on the
              environment is an integral part of Integrated Pest Management. (IPM).  The
              North Carolina State University's Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center for Integrated Pest Management (IPM) continues to meet the criteria of
              the I/UCRC Program.    The Center helped start the Global IPM Informational
              Database Management system during its first five years as an I/UCRC.  This has
              grown into a national program that is an outstanding accomplishment.    The
              research of the Center will continue to address: 1) Impact of pest management
              on environmental quality; 2) Crop loss assessment and economic threshold
              determinations; 3) Genetic engineering for improved pest management; 4)
              Improved understanding of pest biology and ecology; 5) Pesticide resistance
              detection and management; and 6) Development of communications and decision
              support systems for IPM.
