Abstract    :
              9612122  Buchanan  Cermet (metal-oxide composite) films for sensor applications
              require high temperature  coefficient of resistance (TCR), wide resistance
              range (20-10k(), and high piezoresistive strain sensitivity.  Such Ni-ZrO2
              cermet films have been successfully prepared on silicon substrates by the MOD
              process.  The formation of molecular clusters during this process offers
              distinct advantages in achieving homogeneous microstructures in these difficult
              to fabricate cermet films.  Controlled sintering in a reducing atmosphere
              modulates the Ni phase and the resistive properties of the cermet films. 
              Electrical conduction in cermets is controlled by key microstructural features
              such as grain size, grain morphology and porosity.  In all cases, conductive
              paths must be formed through the structure in order to have dominant metallic
              behavior with low resistance and positive TCR.  In cermets, both TCR and
              piezoresistance are of interest near the percolation conductivity threshold
              composition.  At this threshold, as insulator content increaqes, resistance
              increases several orders of magnitude, TCR changes from positive to negative,
              and piezoresistive gauge factor increases.  Positive TCR, negative TCR (NTC),
              and piezoresistive sensor materials can all be produced within a tight volume %
              metal range in this transition region.  This behavior will be thoroughly
              investigated in this study.  Ni-ZrO2 represents a 2 phase composite system
              containing a non-noble metal component that does not react with the insulative
              component.  The thin film MOD Ni-ZrO2 system, therefore, is of interest for
              several reasons.  Increased ZrO2 in the Ni-ZrO2 thin film cermet allows the
              design of higher resistance films with high TCR.  Films fabricated by the
              author exhibit high TCR of 3000-6800 ppm/(C over Ni volume contents in the
              30-80 vol.% Ni range.  Advantages of these Ni-ZrO2 thin films are: silicon
              compatibility, controlled thickness in micron range films (0.2-l(m), high
              strength, and adherence to Si, SiO2 and A1203 sub strates, and demonstrated
              pressure sensitivity.  Resistive changes indicating piezoresistive gauge
              factors approaching 50 have been measured for the MOD derived Ni-ZrO2 cermet
              films.  In the proposed work the effects of the deposition process, including
              the underlying solution chemistry will be investigated.  The effects of
              sintering variables, including rapid thermal annealing(RTA), on resistance
              properties in the Ni-ZrO2 cermet composite films will also be studied, with a
              view to developing a model for predicting sensor properties.  ***
