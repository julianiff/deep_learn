Abstract    :
              9612588  Pavone    WISP is a six-year old co-curricular initiative that
              supplements  women s introduction to college-level mathematics and the sciences
               by offering experiences and connections with scientists that are  designed to
              enhance and reinforce their initial science interests  WISP is an impressive
              program that:    I.   Utilizes three basic types of mentoring for young women
              --       first-year research internships, linking faculty mentors with      
              students; peer mentoring, using upper level women science       majors as
              mentors for first year students; and electronic       mentoring, matching
              undergraduate and graduate women with       mentors from industry; and      II.
               Demonstrated progress and success of students mentored in six       years:    
                --   the percentage of women majoring in science has increased           
              from 12% (45 women) in 1990 to 25% (124) in 1995;       --   one out of every
              four science majors were women in 1990;            in 1995, four out of every
              ten (40%) science majors were            women; many have gone on to graduate
              school;       --   159 science faculty have been involved in effecting this    
                     change;       --   approximately 60% of women entering Dartmouth express
              an            interest in science vs. 40-45% prior to the project;       --  
              participation in all programs has jumped from            approximately 100 to
              approximately 1,000;       --   faculty have mentored over 446 first-year
              research            interns, 55% of which have declared a science major at     
                    the close of their sophomore year;       --   472 first-year women have
              been mentored by upper-class            peers in science.
