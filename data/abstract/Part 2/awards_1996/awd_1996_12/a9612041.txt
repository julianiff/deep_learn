              Proposal Title: The Pilot Study for the Implementation of Engineering Criteria
              2000    Abstract:  This project by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and
              Technology, Inc. (ABET) is a Pilot Study for the Implementation of Engineering
              Criteria 2000.  This is an outgrowth of a consensus building process to develop
              a reformed accreditation criteria that will maintain strong focus on quality
              and professional preparation while offering flexibility for major innovations
              in curricular design and delivery methods.  Engineering Criteria 2000 is a
              simplified, flexible set of outcome assessment based criteria that responds to
              the national call from leaders in industry, government, and academe for a
              reformed criteria.  The Pilot Study, leading to the implementation of
              Engineering Criteria 2000 in the Fall of 2001, consists of a series of
              workshops, structured reviews, and pilot accreditation visits.  Participants
              include institutional representatives such as deans, department heads, industry
              advisory representatives, faculty liaisons, and ABET representatives including
              team chairs, visiting teams, and members of the professional societies who work
              together to forge a reformed process for accreditation under Engineering
              Criteria 2000.  The Pilot Study will produce case studies and training
              materials covering such topics as the Development of Program Goals and
              Objectives, Assessment Plans, and Assessment Measurement and Tools suitable for
              a diverse spectrum of institutions and evaluators.
