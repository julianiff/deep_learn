Abstract    :
              9612808  Yentsch    The Education Development Center, Inc. will undertake an
              analysis of the effectiveness of  the Research Experiences  for Undergraduates
              (REU) and Minority Experiences programs on the ocean sciences.   The focus of
              the evaluation is twofold: the work will provide an independent assessment of
              the short-term impact that these programs have had on the student participants,
              their mentors, the research/learning environment at the host institution and on
              the field of ocean sciences as a whole.  Secondly, a community-based evaluation
              mechanism will be designed that is intended to provide NSF with a standardized
              framework for self-assessment and evaluation in a format that will be suitable
              for future electronic tracking.
