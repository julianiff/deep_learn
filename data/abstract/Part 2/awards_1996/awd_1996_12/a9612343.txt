Abstract    :
              9612343  Doherty    The process of plastic deformation is explored at the level 
              of individual grains in a polycrystalline metal the related  nature of the
              interactions between adjacent grains.  To this  end the evolution of
              grain-scale microstructure occurring  with deformation in commercially pure
              aluminum is studied  using a Osplit sample testO in channel-die compression. 
              Back-scattered Kikuchi diffraction (BKD) and Orientation  Imaging Microscopy
              (OIM) are employed to determine grain  orientations.  A selected range of
              deformation paths, strain  levels, temperatures and strain rates, grain sizes,
              sub-  grain particles, and starting textures are explored to gain 
              understanding of the deformation process.  A goal of the  research is to
              determine the inherent length scale that is  associated with in-grain
              misorientations; this is the size  of the regions which rotate together within
              each grain.  Local strain distribution is measured within and between  grains
              using photoresist techniques and OIM.  Modeling is  aimed at correcting
              observed deficiencies in current models  and are extended for the prediction of
              the observed inherent  length scales.  %%%  The plastic deformation of
              polycrystalline metallic alloys  is an important process in wrought alloy
              manufacture.  The  research could lead to a predictive model for in-grain 
              misorientations and recrystallization.  ***
