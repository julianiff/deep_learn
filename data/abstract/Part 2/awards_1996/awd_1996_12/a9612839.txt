Abstract    :
              This grant will maintain and operate two coordinated 'Class I' optical
              instruments at the Polar Cap Observatory site for three consecutive seasons, as
              well as analyze data sets from these instruments to systematically address
              problems in mesospheric and thermospheric physics.  The instrument, already in
              place, are a Fabry-Perot interferometer and a fully digital all-sky
              monochromatic imager system with thermoelectrically cooled bare CCD detector
              and programmable filter wheel.  The two instruments, deployed in the 'Early
              PCO' building,  completed their first full season of observations in May, 1996,
              and results have been presented.  The Fabry-Perot interferometer is performing
              above expectations, and results will continue to be shared with the aeronomical
              community through CEDAR and Canadian sponsored efforts.  In addition, these two
              instruments will provide training for Genene Fisher, a graduate student,
              investigating:  (1) gravity wave, 'pseudo-tides,' and planetary wave
              characteristics, (2) mesopause dynamics and energetics at high geomagnetic
              latitude, (3) lower thermospheric dynamics and energetics at high geomagnetic
              latitude, (4) collaborative studies with other high-latitude instruments, (5)
              impact of high-latitude auroras on structure and dynamics, (6) plasma drifts,
              patches and blobs, (7) ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling processes, and (8)
              effects of geomagnetic perturbations.
