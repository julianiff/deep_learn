Abstract    :
              For    manufacturing    industries   to    remain    competitive, 
              considerations  such as the ease of assembly,  graspability,  and  ease  of 
              feeding  must be taken into account when  products  are  designed.  This grant
              provides an extended opportunity to  attack  exciting  new  research topics
              that fall within the same  general  research  area  as  the  original grant: 
              combining  sensors  and  actuators with few degrees of freedom to grasp and
              orient  parts.  Remaining  open  problems  related to  the  parallel-jaw 
              gripper  include a fast algorithm for estimating 2 point frictional grasps  of 
              a  given polyhedral part and finding grasps that will  permit  the  part  to 
              be pivoted into the desired final  pose  under  an  active  pivot servo.  We
              will also investigate how parts  can  be  oriented  and  sorted as they move on
              a conveyor belt  against  a  passive  sequence  of  fences  and a  method  for 
              systematically  feeding parts with controlled vibrations on a metal plate.  
              Sony  uses a variant on this idea in their APOS system but they do  not  have 
              a  science  base for programming it. The aim  of  this  new  research is to
              develop such a science base.
