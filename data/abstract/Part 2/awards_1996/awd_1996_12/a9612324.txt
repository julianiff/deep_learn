Abstract    :
              This grant will promote the diagnosis and understanding of the behavior of
              global climate models in polar regions.  The diagnostic tasks will complement
              upcoming Arctic field programs (SHEBA, ARM), driven by the need to narrow the
              uncertainties in model simulations of climate change.  Research will draw upon
              daily output of a set of global climate models to (1) assess the Arctic
              cloud-radiation-temperature associations in the model simulations, permitting
              direct comparisons with results of the field measurements, (2) determine the
              frequency and spatial distribution of extreme events in the atmospheric model
              simulations, and (3) determine the contribution of surface winds to apparent
              biases in simulated evapotranspiration over polar surfaces.  In addition, the
              PI will compose a review paper synthesizing many recent sea ice sensitivity
              experiments with global climate models to identify priorities for improving the
              treatment of sea ice in climate models.      The research is important because
              it will increase understanding of climate processes in polar regions, as well
              as improve our ability to simulate these processes with mathematical/physical
              models.
