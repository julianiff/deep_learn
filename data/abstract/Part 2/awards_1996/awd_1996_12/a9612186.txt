Abstract    :
              9612186  Sanders  Reinforced concrete hinges are frequently used at the base  of
              bridge columns to release moment transfer in one or both  principal directions.
               Hinged column bases are used  throughout the country for reducing foundation
              forces for  thermal/shrinkage loads and other loads in the direction of  the
              hinge.  The proposed study will investigate strength  evaluation and
              retrofitting of reinforced concrete pinned  bridge pier to footing connections.
               The project is an  experimental study with ten 1/2-scale specimens.    The
              research will study the effects of axial load, develop  and test retrofit
              details, and determine the shear strength  capacity in the weak axis direction
              under large cyclic  rotations.  The design, retrofit, and repair
              recommendations  will provide designers with a methodology from which to 
              evaluate and design one-way hinges in piers.  ***
