Abstract    :
              The PIs will draw on newly available measurements to determine the limits of
              model validity by comparing predictions with a representative set of direct,
              large-scale maps of high-latitude convection.  The database, furnished by the
              SuperDARN system of HF radars, has demonstrated that these measurements resolve
              the large-scale features of convection that the models predict.  The PIs will
              select a number of SuperDARN archival events as a testbed for model validation,
              then generate the predictions of the models for the selected events and devise
              evaluation schemes for gauging their success.  The research will produce a
              characterization of the predictive value of convection models, recommendations
              for model improvement, and methods of combining models and direct measurements
              to optimally map convection.
