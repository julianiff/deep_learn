Abstract    :
               This grant is to purchase a physical acoustic high-frequency data acquisition
              and signal process system for the investigation of in-process abrasive damage
              assessment techniques using acoustic emission.  The equipment will enable the
              research conducted by the Abrasive Micro-Machining Center at Kansas State
              University to obtain acoustic emission data well beyond the audible range,
              thereby facilitating efforts to analyze the full range of data generated by the
              acoustic emission signals.  The system will be used to investigate innovative
              methodologies for identifying the acoustic emission signatures associated with
              workpiece subsurface damage in conventional and non-conventional abrasive
              process of ceramics and steels and to develop acoustic emission methods for
              in-process damage assessment and control.   The acoustic emission data
              acquisition and signal process system substantially enhances the research
              capability of the Abrasive Micro-Machining Center at Kansas State University
              for understanding subsurface damage in conventional and non-conventional
              abrasive process of ceramics and steels.  It is also valuable to the
              development of acoustic emission methods for in-process damage assessment and
              control.
