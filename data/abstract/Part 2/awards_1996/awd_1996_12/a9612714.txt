Abstract    :
                      ABSTRACT      The Interfacial, Transport, and Separations Programs of
              the Chemical and Transport Systems Division is funding research of Dr. Sridhar
              Komarneni, at the Pennsylvania State University.  Dr. Komarneni is working on
              developing a novel swelling mica to remove heavy, divalent cations such as lead
              and strontium.  The material is novel in that it selectively adsorbs these
              cautions and after a specific uptake level, collapses, thus preventing
              back-exchange.   The research will address the uptake kinetics and
              selectivity's, and will seek to characterize the material during the uptake
              process using X-ray diffraction and NMR analysis.    This research may lead to
              the development of a novel material capable of selectively removing toxic,
              heavy metal contaminants.   Additionally, after removal, the collapsible nature
              of the material implies that the contaminants are sealed in a compacted form. 
              Development of this technology may lead to new methods to remove and
              encapsulate toxic metal ion impurities.
