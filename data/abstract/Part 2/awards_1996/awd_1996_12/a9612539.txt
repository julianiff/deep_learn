Abstract    :
              9612539  Nathan  The objectives of this proposed project are to study the effect
              of strain on the characteristics of electronic devices made from III-V
              semiconductor heterostrutures, and to explore possible applications of these
              effects.  We wil study both band structure effects and piezoelectric effects in
              heterostructure devices such as (interband) resonant tunneling diodes and n-
              and p-channel field effect transistors.  Our goal will be to reach a new level
              of understanding that will lead to novel microsensor concepts.  ***
