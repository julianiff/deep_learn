Abstract    :
              The Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy (COSEPUP)  undertakes
              major independent studies of national issues in U.S.  Science policy and U.S.
              technology policy.  In recent years, for  example, it has conducted prominent
              studies on U.S. policy goals  for science and technology, policies related to
              global warming,  integretiy in the conduct of scientific research, U.S. policy
              for  civilian technology, and recruitment and retention of Presidential 
              appointees.    COPSEPUP's core activities, including meetings of the Committee 
              itself and staff of two, are underwritten substantially by internal  funds
              (individual studies are separately funded).  NSF has  supported COSEPUP for 30
              years and is continuing its support this  year.  $522,000 is requested for the
              next three-year period.
