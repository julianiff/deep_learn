Abstract    :
              9612136    Accurate prediction of ground movements due to tunnels and  deep
              excavations  is not only an important part in the design of lateral earth 
              retention  systems, but is also essential for estimating the risk of  damage to
               surrounding facilities.  Deformation prediction is an  integral part of the 
              design-construction process, and provides a framework for  interpretation of 
              instrumentation measurements during construction and for  extrapolating 
              limited measurements made at early construction stages to  assess the impact 
              of construction activities.    This research project is directed toward
              improving the  quality of numerical  predictions of ground movements and
              structural requirements  associated with  deep excavations and tunneling in
              soils, and to further  develop the use of  numerical analysis as a design tool.
               A new advanced  effective stress  constitutive model will be implemented which
              unifies the  modeling of clays,  sands and silts into a finite element code
              able to perform  coupled flow and  soil deformation analysis.  A fundamental
              but "realistic"  evaluation of  major factors controlling the performance of
              deep  excavations and tunnel  will be completed.  The capabilities of the model
              will be  validated through  comparison with performance using a well documented
              study of  a tunnel and  cut-and-cover section in San Francisco Bay mud, a
              process  which will  include a) extensive field instrumentation, b) complete 
              characterization of  the soil profile, and  c) a well documented history of the
               construction  sequence and relevant events which occur during the project.
