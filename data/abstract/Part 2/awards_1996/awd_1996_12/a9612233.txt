Abstract    :
                ***  9612233  Dobry  Lateral spreading of sloping ground or of soil near a 
              waterfront is a pervasive and costly type of liquefaction  induced ground
              failure resulting from earthquakes.  It  causes damage to buildings, bridges,
              embankments, buried  lifelines, and, especially, port facilities.  Especially 
              important is the distress caused to pile foundations, as  illustrated by case
              histories in a number of earthquakes,  including the 1989 Loma Prieta and 1995
              Kobe (Japan) and  Manzanillo (Mexico) events.  Accumulated losses due to 
              lateral spreading, including effects on piles and port  facilities, reaches the
              billions of dollars.  Although  progress has been made toward predicting,
              quantifying and  mitigating these effects, there is an urgent need for 
              improved evaluation procedures.    The project is part of a cooperative
              research program with  the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM).  It 
              focuses on (1) geotechnical centrifuge model testing at  Rensselaer Polytechnic
              Institute (RPI) of earthquake-induced  lateral spreading and its effects on
              single piles and pile  groups (2) laboratory static and cyclic loading research
              at  UNAM on soil from Puerto Manzanillo (3) numerical analyses  of both lateral
              spreading and its effects on piles, and (4)  associated interpretations and
              recommendations, with  particular emphasis on port facilities.  It includes 
              centrifuge modeling at RPI of the Puerto Manzanillo case  history during the
              October 1995 earthquake, and further  evaluation of this case history based on
              the centrifuge  results and other information at UNAM.  The work of the two 
              groups is closely coordinated.    The numerical simulations of the centrifuge
              model tests on  single piles and pile groups subjected to lateral spreading 
              are performed at Cornell University.***
