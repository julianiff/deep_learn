Abstract    :
              9612315  Chong    We propose a one-semester three-credit laboratory course in
              which  first-year graduate students are introduced to several competing  modern
              multivariable control schemes applied to a variety of  physical processes.  In
              this first development phase of the  laboratory, we propose to purchase one
              complete set of the  hardware and software required for each experiment.  In
              addition,  we required for each half-time graduate assistants.  The School  of
              Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University will  provide matching
              funds to cover half of the total cost of the  hardware and software.  ***
