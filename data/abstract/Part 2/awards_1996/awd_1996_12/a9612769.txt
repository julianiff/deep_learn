Abstract    :
              IRI-9612769  This award funds a research workshop on foundations of  information
              and decision fusion, with applications to engineering  problems.  The workshop
              is jointly supported by a number of  Federal agencies.  The NSF support is
              intended to support  participation of researchers from the computer vision
              community  to encourage coupling with the data fusion research community 
              leading to innovative explorations.  The workshop will be held in  the
              Washington DC area in August 1996.  Publications will include  a workshop
              proceedings, a volume of overview papers, and a  special issue of the Journal
              of the Franklin Institute containing  reviewed papers on state of the art in
              the various related  domains.
