Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9612107    The effects of particle charging in synthesis of
              nanosize ceramic powders in  simple flame aerosol reactors will be
              investigated.  On this basis, the validity of a predictive model which would 
              indicate the electric fields can reduce the particle size and narrow the size
              distribution will be tested.  There are conflicting opinions  in aerosol
              community concerning the effect of the electrical field on particle size and
              size distribution.  The role of charging will be tested in premixed flames. 
              Synthesis of oxides of Ti, Si and Sn will be obtained  from their chlorides. 
              The particles will be charged either by ionic wind in the flame by a corona
              discharge or by orienting the ions generated in the flame to external
              electrodes.  The materials to be tested were selected because of  their diverse
              material properties and their technological relevance.    The proposed concepts
              may lead to significant improvements in generation of finer, uniform
              nanoparticles, eventually with controlled cristallinity, at large production
              rates, if the proof-of-concept tests will be successful.  Direct applications
              of the research are in manufacture of fumed silica powders and titania for
              pigments, ceramics, semiconductors and cosmetics
