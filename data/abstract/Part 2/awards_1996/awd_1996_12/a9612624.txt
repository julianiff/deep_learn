Abstract    :
              9612624  Adams    Adams is currently Director of the new National Institute on 
              Mentoring of the National Consortium for Graduate Degrees for  Minorities in
              Engineering and Science, Inc. (GEM). Prior to that,  he served as Executive
              Director of GEM.  Originally created as an  outgrowth of corporate and
              university concerns to increase the  number of underrepresented ethnic/racial
              groups who enter and  complete the engineering master s degree, currently GEM
              operates  programs and conducts activities that address the 
              underrepresentation of ethnic minorities in engineering, science,  and
              mathematics from precollege to doctorate levels. Adams   accomplishments
              include:       Development of a very successful program that has assisted a   
              significant number of students in obtaining higher education    degrees in
              engineering -- developed a program with 69 employers    and 78 universities
              that supports 600 minority graduate students    annually;        Demonstration
              of successful students outcomes -- 1400 master s    degree graduates in
              engineering, 83 of whom obtained doctoral    degrees, an exceptionally number
              of minorities obtaining the    Ph.D. in engineering;        Program
              replicability by several other organizations, e.g., the    National Physical
              Science Consortium;        Program documentation in the form of publications --
              10    monographs on mentoring and related topics;        Demonstrated
              innovation on mentoring -- has expanded work on    mentoring by establishing
              the National Institute on Mentoring;    and         Receipt of awards from
              organizations such as the American    Society for Engineering and the national
              Action Council for    Minorities in Engineering (NACME) Service Award, among
              others.
