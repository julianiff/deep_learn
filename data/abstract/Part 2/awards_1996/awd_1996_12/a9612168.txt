Abstract    :
              9612168 Lesieutre In this proposal we request travel support for a number of
              students pursuing research in power engineering to attend the 28th Annual North
              American Power Symposium (NAPS) to be held November 10-12, 1996, at the
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology. NAPS is an annual conference that
              provides a forum for university students, professors, and industry engineers to
              present and discuss their research.  Students in particular are encouraged to
              participate.  It is often their first opportunity to formally present their
              work before colleagues.  Travel expenses could be a deterrent for students
              planning to attend this conference. In this proposal we discuss the need for
              travel support for student authors, outline the activities planned for the
              conference, and state the expected impact of the requested travel grant. ***
