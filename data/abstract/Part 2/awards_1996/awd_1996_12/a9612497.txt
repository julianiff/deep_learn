Abstract    :
              9612497  Ilegbusi       Processing of materials in the semi-solid state has
              become a potentially attractive means of producing near net-shape parts.  It is
              often achieved by controlling the microstructure from segregation prone alloys.
               However, there still exists a lack of understanding of the rheology and flow
              characteristics of the semi-solid state.  The slurries often exhibit
              fractionation at mold extension and narrow sections.  This phenomenon
              contributes to inhomogeneity of constitutive response and consequently produces
              unacceptable differential solidification and non-uniform mechanical properties
              in the solidified product.  The research project addresses these issues by
              developing models to study the non-isothermal constitutive relationship for
              semi-solid slurries.  Two test materials will be investigated: a tin-lead alloy
              and an aluminum-copper alloy.  These materials will be studied both in the
              absence and presence of externally-imposed particulates of silicon carbide and
              aluminum oxide.  A parallel experiment will be carried out to study the
              mold-filling characteristics under a range of operating conditions.       This
              project has a balance between theory and experiment and could have a  practical
              impact to the near-net shape engineering in manufacturing.
