Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:  CTS 9612528  Principal Investigator:  Sarpkaya,
              Naval Postgraduate School    The objectives of this investigation, involving
              two universities, are: (i) To carry out complementary experimental and
              numerical research in order to explore the structure and dynamics of vortex
              breakdown in turbulent swirling flows; (ii) To elucidate the physics of the
              phenomena and provide archival-quality experimental data for the assessment and
              validation of CFD codes with anisotropic turbulence models and for current as
              well as future scientific and technological developments; (iii) To carefully
              assess existing phenomenological models; (iv) To develop an understanding of
              the consequences of turbulence on vortex breakdown for its intellectual
              challenge and technological applications in aerodynamics, in combustion, and in
              general, in the development of effective flow control strategies in devices
              employing swirl dynamics.  It is intended that this study would lead to
              reliable computer codes which might be used for industrial research and design.
                 This grant is for the experimental component.  A matching grant was made to
              the Utah State University for the numerical phase (CTS-9613143).
