Abstract    :
              9612538  Kenny  This proposal describes an effort to develop a Micromachined
              Calorimeter for the NASA/JPL New Millennium Spacecraft Program.  This device
              will be used to study effects of the ion engine exhaust plume on passive
              infrared radiators used to release heat from the spacecraft core and from
              science instruments.  New Millennium is a technology validation program, and
              will provide a flight opportunity on the first Deep Space 1 (DS1).    The
              performance of exposure calorimeters is improved through reduction of heat
              capacity and thermal conductance.  Silicon Micromachining is ideally suited to
              this task, offering low-stress nitride membranes with well-characterized,
              thermal, mechanical, and optical characteristics.  The expected characteristics
              of the Micromachined Calorimeter offer a significant performance improvement
              over conventionally-built calorimeters.  ***
