Abstract    :
              The critical importance of robust, flexible, and efficient software tools has
              long been recognized, and has been a major discussion topic at several national
              meetings, including those organized by the PI.  These meetings focused on the
              difficulties associated with building good tools, and the lack of
              infrastructure for tool development and test. This proposal is for a workshop
              to discuss design and implementation solutions to the lack of these software
              tools for high performance computing systems.  The discussions will focus will
              focus primarily on issues of debugging, performance measurement, analysis, and
              presentation as they relate to these needs.  By including academic researchers,
              vendors, and government agency representatives, a wide variety of opinions,
              viewpoints, and needs can be presented and explored to the mutual benefit of
              all the groups.
