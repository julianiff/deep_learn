Abstract    :
              An existing sodium lidar, installed at Colorado State University, makes
              significant geophysical measurements of temperature profiles in the mesopause
              region.  An important element of this transmitter is a stable, narrowband cw
              laser beam that seeds the high power pulsed dye amplifier.  The present unit,
              consisting of an argon-ion laser and single-mode ring dye laser, has the
              versatility required of an exploratory system, but has excessive space, power
              and maintenance requirements.  Thus, a compact, solid-state cw light source is
              being developed at the Desert Research Institute.  The PI will modify this
              solid state light source into an operational, portable unit by (1) mounting it
              on a small optical breadboard with enclosure, making the mechanical and optical
              setup more rugged; (2) developing simple and fast tuning and locking procedure
              to stabilize the output wavelength to Doppler free features of the sodium
              spectrum; and (3) testing and using the system in conjunction with the existing
              sodium lidar at CSU.
