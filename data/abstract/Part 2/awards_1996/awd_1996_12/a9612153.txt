Abstract    :
              9634606  Scanlan  Description:  This award is for the U.S.-India research
              collaboration  in wind engineering between Robert Scanlan of Johns Hopkins 
              University and Prem Krishna of the University of Roorkee.   Experiments will be
              conducted at the Corrsin laminar flow wind  tunnel at Hopkins and at the new
              boundary layer tunnel at Roorkee.   The investigators will study the specific
              use and interpretation of  bridge deck section models and building models in
              the respective  wind tunnels.  Theory developed at Hopkins on the use of
              flutter  derivatives in determining wind stability will be used relative to 
              section models at Roorkee and Hopkins.  The research will  investigate the
              detailed geometric forms needed to enhance stability  in deck models.    Scope:
               This award will allow travel between the research sites to  complete the
              agreed upon level of effort.  This project will develop  the flutter
              derivatives concept, considered a major advance in wind  engineering, and
              extend abroad the influence of U.S. technology in  aerodynamic design.  For
              India, the project will contribute to  developing modelling expertise,
              technical education, and  improvements in design and construction methods.
