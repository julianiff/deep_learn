Abstract    :
                      Work under this award includes developing a standard-based quality of
              service (QoS) management capability for the Internet.  The Internet
              architecture and protocols are undergoing a major extension to provide
              integrated services, meeting the growing need for real-time distributed
              applications.  With the imminent availability of multicasting and Q0S
              capability in commercial IP routers, Q0S management of the integrated services
              Internet architecture becomes a crucial step for progress.  The set of managed
              objects, the Q0S monitoring and controlling tools, and the evaluations
              resulting from this experiment are expected to provide insights into the
              management of the future integrated services Internet.
