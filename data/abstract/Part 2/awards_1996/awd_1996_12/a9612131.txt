Abstract    :
              This is a three year standard award. The research aims to develop a
              domain-independent computational model of negotiation capable of addressing
              several complex issues, such as multi-issue negotiation and decision-making
              under incomplete information. The research is based on a sequential
              decision-making view of negotiation that provides a natural representation of
              the multi-stage nature of negotiation. Issues such as learning associated with
              updating beliefs about a partially-known world will be addressed.  The original
              sequential-decision-making-based negotiation model will be extended to
              explicitly model strategic parts of negotiation. The resulting formalism can be
              made computationally tractable by applying dynamic programming strategies.
              Under this model, many key issues, such as asymmetric information among agents,
              dynamic processes of negotiation, changing environments, etc. can be analyzed
              and explored experimentally. In addition, the research will contribute to the
              emerging field of multi-agent learning. Computationally efficient multi-agent
              learning algorithms will be developed and the impact of introducing learning in
              the model will be explored. To evaluate this research, a multi-agent simulation
              testbed will be developed and utilized to conduct empirical studies. These
              studies will be directed toward significant theoretical and practical
              questions, such as the effectiveness of different negotiation strategies and
              learning algorithms in realistic problem scenarios from domains such as supply
              contracting.
