Abstract    :
              9612519  Rutledge        The U.S. Weather Research Program (USWRP) is an
              interagency activity  designed to perform and implement the research necessary
              to improve the delivery  of weather services to the nation.  Under this
              Program, the National Science  Foundation and the National Oceanic and
              Atmospheric Administration are jointly  evaluating and supporting weather
              research of high priority to the USWRP.          This proposal seeks support
              for participation in initial research efforts of the  U.S. Weather Research
              Program.  The research will center on improving estimates  of precipitation
              amounts and type (hydrometeor identification) from the NEXRAD  (Next Generation
              of Radar) WSR-88D radar network.  The Principal Investigators  will employ
              research-quality polarimetric radars to improve radar derived  precipitation
              estimates, as well as in evaluating NEXRAD algorithms for  hydrometeor
              identification.  Two instrumented mobile vans, one of them equipped  with the
              Austrian two dimensional  video disdrometer, and the other with 
              capacitance-type rain gage, electronic hail sensor and NCAR hail catcher net
              (for  manual collection) will be deployed for in situ verification.          
              Since current radar derived precipitation estimates are virtually ineffective 
              beyond ranges of 100 km or so, the researchers will develop statistically-based
               techniques for estimating precipitation at such longer ranges (e.g.,
              cumulative  distribution function matching or neural network techniques).      
                 Two pilot field programs are planned, one for the summer of 1996, and the 
              second for the winter of 1996-97.  A third field program is planned for the
              summer  of 1998 in Oklahoma using the National Severe Storm Laboratory's
              polarimetric  upgraded prototype WSR-88D.          This research will have an
              immediate impact on quantitative precipitation  forecasting by providing more
              robust information on precipitation amounts and type.  ***
