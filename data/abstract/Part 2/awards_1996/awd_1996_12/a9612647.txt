Abstract    :
              This project addresses the central hypotheses of the Arctic System Science LAII
              Flux Study by examining spatial (local and regional) and temporal (interannual
              to interdecadal) variations in soil active layer thickness.  this is done on
              representative landscapes by using different probing and soil coring approaches
              (grids, transects, and point data).  Standard 1 km x 1 km grids are located in
              different landscape units across the Alaska Arctic Slope.  the LAII sites,
              which are shared by other Flux Study projects, were selected in most cases
              based on availability of long-term data sets including soil thaw and local
              climate records.  The study relies upon high frequency, site specific
              determination of active layer thickness as a function of climate, soil
              properties, and landscape units (geobotanical complexes).  the historical
              boundary between the base of the recelt soil thaw and the upper permafrost is
              established by coring the frozen ground and observing the distribution and
              morphology of the ground ice.  The thaw depth measurements are used to validate
              or modify active layer models and to assess climate change upon the arctic
              tundra ecosystem.  The carbon status of the soils and near-surface permafrost
              are established across landscape units and serve as a basis for carbon balance
              extrapolations to regional scales.
