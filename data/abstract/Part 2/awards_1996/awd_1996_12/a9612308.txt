Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:  9612308  Principal Investigator:  Renardy   
              This research is concerned with the shape of the interface between two
              immiscible  liquids.  Theoretically there are often many possibilities for the
              shape of the boundary between the two fluids.  However, experiments show that
              certain shapes are often preferred among the several possibilities.  The
              motivation of this research is to lessen the gap between theoretical prediction
               and experimental observation.  A combination of physical modeling,  analysis ,
              and computational techniques will be used to achieve the desired results.  The
              focus of this study will be on several important issues including the role of
              oscillatory forcing as a dynamic stabilization or destabilization mechanism,
              two layered polymeric flows and two layer convection.    This study has
              applications in the manufacture of bi-component  polymeric materials and
              layered films, and in bi-component  liquid flow in pipes and channels such as
              in the use of water to assist in the more economical transport of petroleum
              products in pipelines.  A major problem in this technology is the unexpected
              behavior of two fluid systems.
