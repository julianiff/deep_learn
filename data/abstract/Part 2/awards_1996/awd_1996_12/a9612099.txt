Abstract    :
              The objective of this work is the point design study of the Illinois Aggressive
              Cache-Only Memory Architecture (I-ACOMA) multiprocessor, a novel distributed
              shared-memory, multiprocessor (DSM) that delivers petaflop-scale performance
              without surrendering programmability.  I-ACOMA is designed to address some of
              the most important challenges that architects will face in the next two
              decades, namely the widening gap between the speed of multi-Ghz processors and
              the much slower cache hierarchy, memory and network subsystems, the increasing
              under-utilization of the large number of transistors that can be embedded on  a
              processor chip, and the disappointingly poor machine utilization in many key
              applications like sparse computations and database workloads.  To address these
              issues, I-ACOMA includes a very aggressive memory hierarchy, multithreaded
              superscalar processors, and architectural support for sparse computations and
              databases.  On the software side, the code running on I-ACOMA is generated by a
              compiler that automatically parallelizes Fortran 90 programs.  The compiler
              exposes both loop- and instruction-level parallelism.  In addition, it
              generates data forward directives.  Finally, on the application side, while
              I-ACOMA is a general-purpose machine, it will focus on two sets of grand
              challenge applications, namely sparse computations and database applications.
