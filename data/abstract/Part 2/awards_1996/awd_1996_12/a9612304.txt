Abstract    :
              9612304  Henley  This grant supports work on a variety of cutting-edge  problems
              in material magnetism.  In a continuation of a  successful program, the current
              project includes: (1)  discrete spin models in 2 dimension with interface 
              representations, (2) Application of semiclassical (path  integral) approaches
              to spatially finite spin systems and  (3) Spin order in highly frustrated
              Heisenberg  antiferromagnets.  These projects involve use of a  combination of
              analytical skills and numerical methods.  The  two specific projects where the
              original problems are long-  standing questions and which are expected to be
              resolved  during the present grant using some of the techniques  developed by
              this PI are: the ground state of an S=1/2  quantum antiferromagnet on a
              triangular lattice and  properties of SrCrGaO, a magnetic material with a two
              layer  Kagome sandwich structure.  %%%  This grant supports work on a variety
              of problems in  material magnetism that are both highly complex in that they 
              remain unsolved (after a half century of careful search for  solutions) so far
              and are derived from state of the art  questions in material magnetism.  There
              are magnets where  the interaction between individual spins (the constituent 
              unit at the atomic level) is strong but highly competitive  and "frustrated" in
              the sense that the neighboring spins  demand conflicting orientation for a
              specific spin.  These  materials become magnetic, if at all, only at very low 
              temperatures and then they often have strong anomalous  properties.  This
              project is a theoretical study of the  experimental properties of frustrated
              magnets that have been  reported recently.  ***
