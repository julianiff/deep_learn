Abstract    :
              The PI will investigate the plasma electrodynamics of the low-latitude E region.
               He will accomplish this by making comprehensive measurements of basic plasma
              parameters needed to evaluate existing models of the equatorial electrojet and
              low-latitude ionosphere.  These measurements will include incoherent scatter
              (IS) spectral measurements of the ionospheric region, and semi-coherent
              backscatter radar measurements to complement the IS measurements.  The lack of
              plasma parameters and electric field measurements has slowed progress in
              understanding low-latitude E-region electrodynamics.  The PI will use two
              radars in a series of coordinated experiments:  (1) the ALTAIR, a fully
              steerable IS radar located in Kwajalein, to obtain the first high-resolution,
              IS spectral measurements of the low-latitude E region; and (2) the FAR, a
              portable, frequency-agile radar, to measure backscatter from type-2
              irregularities in the equatorial electrojet and the 150 km echoes.  In sum,
              this research is essential for understanding the coupling processes occurring
              in different geographical regions, and between plasma and neutral gas in
              different altitude regions.
