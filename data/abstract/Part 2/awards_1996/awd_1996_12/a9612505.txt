Abstract    :
              9612505  Kumar    Funds are provided to the International Liquid Crystal Society
              in  the Support of the 16th International Liquid Crystal Conference  be held
              June 24-28, 1996 at Kent State University.  The  conference is sponsored by the
              National Science Foundation  Science and Technology Center for Advanced Liquid
              Crystalline  Optical Materials, Gordon and Breach Publishers, and the Society 
              for Information Display.  The Conference is held every two years  at different
              sites around the world and this year it returns to  its birthplace, the campus
              of Kent State University.  %%%  The International Liquid Crystal Conference,
              the premier  conference in the field, focuses on basic research, and attracts 
              scientists worldwide from academic, industrial and government  laboratories,
              and students studying in the field.  The conference  provides a forum for the
              exchange of scientific ideas and  technological advances in every aspect of
              liquid crystals.  The  program consists of plenary, invited, and contributed
              talks, as  well as poster presentations.  The requested funds will support 
              students, postdoctoral associates, and academic speakers who  otherwise may
              find it financially difficult to attend the  conference.  ***
