Abstract    :
              9612908  Porod    The Fifth International Workshop on Computational Electronics 
              (IWCE-5) will be held at the University of Notre Dame on May 28-  30, 1997.  As
              in previous meetings, the workshop will cover all  aspects of advanced
              simulation of electronic transport in  semiconductors and semiconductor
              devices,particularly those which  use large computational resources .  IWCE-5
              will focus on the  following three themes: (i) The need of large scale
              simulation in  optoelectronics, (ii) Monte Carlo simulations, and (iii) 
              Nanostructure simulation including atomistic processes in  conventional devices
              (such as degradation effects).  Specific  workshop agenda and a preliminary
              list of invited speakers will  be discussed at a planning meeting to be held at
              the Beckman  Institute.  ***
