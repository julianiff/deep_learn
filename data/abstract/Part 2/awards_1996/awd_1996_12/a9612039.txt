Abstract    :
              9612039  Pachavis    Funds are provided to the Materials Research Society in the
               Support of the 1996 MRS Fall Meeting during December 2-6, 1996.  This 3.5-day
              symposium on the "Solid State Chemistry of Inorganic  Materials" will be the
              first comprehensive meeting on this topic  held under the auspices of a major
              U.S. professional society.  Anticipated session topics include:  Synthesis and
              Reactivity of  Solids; Chemistry of Surfaces and Interfaces; Theory and 
              Modeling; and Crystal Chemistry and Phase Stability.  %%%  This meeting will
              emphasize the multidisciplinary and  international nature of solid-state
              chemistry and the benefits of  nurturing productive interfaces among
              university, government and  industrial laboratories.  The intent of the
              symposium is to  provide an interdisciplinary forum for discussion and exchange
              of  ideas on recent fundamental advances in Solid-State Chemistry and  their
              impacts on the development and application of inorganic  materials.  ***
