Abstract    :
              9612303  Pickering    Alloy dissolution involves the selective removal of one 
              component of the alloy under the action of a corrosive  medium in a particular
              service environment.  As the alloy  leaching occurs, the mechanical properties
              of the alloy  deteriorate significantly.  The mechanisms of dealloying in 
              metal alloys are under study in this grant.  Several  research thrusts are
              underway, including (1) the effects of  lattice strain on the electrochemical
              behavior and surface  morphology of alloys undergoing selective dissolution;
              (2)  characterization of surface morphology, chemical composition  and
              correlation with current at early transient stages of  dealloying, below and
              above the critical potential; (3)  evaluation of the effects of key inhibitors
              and surfactants  on the dealloying behavior; (4) the significance of 
              underpotential deposition with regards to the dissolution-  redeposition
              mechanism; (5) evaluation of the magnitude and  consequences of ohmic potential
              drop within the electrolyte  that fills the pits that form upon dealloying
              above the  critical potential; (6) application of scanning tunneling 
              microscopy to study dealloying with increased spatial  resolution.  The
              research covers a variety of alloys in the  copper, zinc, and amalgam families.
               %%%  This grant addresses a serious problem in industry and civil 
              infrastructure, dealloying and its degrading effects on  metal alloys.  The
              problem affects a wide variety of alloys  and components,  high strength
              steels, superalloys, machine  parts, faucets and water pipes, and even dental
              fillings.  ***
