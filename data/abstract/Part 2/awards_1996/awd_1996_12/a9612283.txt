Abstract    :
              9612283  Dupuis  This multidisciplinarv research project, overlapping the 
              disciplines of Materials Science, Electrical Engineering, and  Chemistry
              comprises a comprehensive approach to study the  synthesis and properties of
              thin film native oxides in  technologically important III-V semiconductors, as
              well as  addressing the improvement of optoelectronic devices through the  use
              of these oxides.  The overall aim is to achieve greater basic  understanding
              and subsequent development of a native oxide  suitable for compound
              semiconductor structures to obtain  comparable performance to the role and
              importance of SiO2 in  silicon based electronics.  %%%  The project combines
              concepts and methodologies from materials  science, electrical engineering,
              chemistry and physics with  advanced electronic, spectroscopic and structural 
              characterization tools to address forefront issues at the  interfaces between
              these disciplines.  The research will  contribute basic new knowledge at a
              fundamental level to several  aspects of materials science engineering, and
              optoelectronics.  An important feature of the program is the integration of 
              research and education through the training of students in  fundamental
              interdisciplinary research areas.  ***
