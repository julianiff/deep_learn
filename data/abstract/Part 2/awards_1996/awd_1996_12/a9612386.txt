Abstract    :
              9612386  Chu  This research aims to develop and study metal nanoparticles  by
              taking advantage of the well-organized  microheterogeneities in hydrogels.  Two
              types of such  microheterogeneities are proposed:  the study of weakly  charged
              polyelectrolyte hydrogels with microphase separation  due to the competition of
              polyelectrolyte/hydrophobic  interactions, and hydrogel/surfactant systems
              which can form  highly ordered supramolecular nano/microstructures.  The  metal
              ions can be replaced by noble or rare earth ions whose  subsequent reduction
              will then bring to the formation of  metallic nanoparticles inside the gels or
              microgel  particles.    Water is obviously the best choice as a solvent for a
              number  of reasions, including environmental considerations,  potential use for
              widespread catalytic reactions which take  place in aqueous media, and the
              possibility for biological  applications.  The synthesis of metal nanoparticles
              within  the gels which can swell intensively in water should be very  useful,
              because the highly responsive medium has a high  susceptibility to any changes
              of the external aqueous  solution.  We aim to control the size and the shape of
              metal  nonoparticles, as well as the polymer properties, such as  mesh size, in
              order to regulate the catalytic activity of  metal nanoparticles and surfaces. 
              %%%  This research is in the area of nanotechnology and should  help to lay the
              foundation for design and environmentally  conscious processing of 
              polyelectrolytes, gels, and  nanoparticles.  ***
