Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT  OPP-9612532  GRAYSON/KING      This dissertation project will
              use data from the Upper Kolyma region, northeastern Siberia, to undertake a
              broad examination of stone tool technology over a 4000 year period (11,000 -
              7,000 B.P.). The proposed research involves an analysis of material from three
              sites (Uptar, Kheta, Buyunda), an analysis of assemblage variability using
              published reports, and the investigation of the potentials of an environmental
              model for explaining artifact variability in this region. This study will make
              a significant contribution toward understanding the early prehistory of
              northeastern Siberia. A regional analysis of tools and manufacturing debris,
              and the environment in which people made and used tools, is prerequisite to an
              understanding of the earliest settlers of Beringia and the New World.
