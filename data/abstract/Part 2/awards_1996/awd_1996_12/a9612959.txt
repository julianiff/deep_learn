Abstract    :
              The Portable Runtime Systems (PORTS) is a consortium of research universities,
              national laboratories, and computer vendors interested in advancing research
              for software systems that at run time provide support to compilers and tools
              for current and next generation supercomputers.  Specific goals of the group
              are: (i) to provide a forum for exchange of information on various aspects
              related to parallel and distributed computing, (ii) to promote the development
              of standard applications programming interfaces (APIs) in multithreading,
              communication, dynamic resource management, and performance measurement that
              will be used as a compiler target for various task-parallel and data-parallel
              languages, (iii) to provide support for interoperability across parallel
              languages and problem solving environments, and (iv) to encourage the
              development of a community code repository that results from this consortium's
              activities.  In the next 12 months this group plans to focus on three major
              classes of communication primitives: (i) get/put for point-to-point
              communication (ii) remote service request for control, and (iii) reduction
              operations on "ropes" for collective communication on groups of threads.  The
              product of this effort will be the definition and document of APIs for very
              efficient communication and control operations to be used for the development
              of run-time support systems for parallel compilers and parallel tools.
