Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9612634    Principal Investigator:  Nader Engheta    Title:
               Theoretical study of applications of fractional calculus in electromagnetism  
                 In this research, a theoretical investigation using the fractional calculus
              approach to waves and geometries of interest will be developed.  The fractional
              calculus approach enables the study of waves and structures with an
              intermediate character. It is an area which has been developed with major
              contributions from the PI.  Under the present study, the following topics will
              be investigated: (1) "fractional" intermediate sources and (2) applications of
              fractional calculus in electromagnetic scattering.  Dual investigations of
              geometries and boundaries for which an incident plane waves generates scattered
              waves with fractional characteristics, and, conversely the scattering of
              incident waves with fractional characteristics from various geometries will be
              carried out.  In each of these areas, a new corresponding development of the
              theory itself will be investigated (1') extension of the concept of fractional
              order multipoles for complex sources involving electric and magnetic
              fractional-order multipoles and/or aperture fields and (2') the development of
              a "fractional" curl operator, both for analysis of the electromagnetic
              scattering interactions as stated in (2) and for investigation the basic
              concepts involved in the duality of the fractional character of the waves and
              the geometries.
