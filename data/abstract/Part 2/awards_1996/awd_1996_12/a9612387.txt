Abstract    :
              9612387  Chung  This award provides partial support for speakers and
              participants  in "A Combinatorics and Graph Theory Conference on the Occasion 
              of Herb Wilf's 65th Birthday,''  to be held at the University of  Pennsylvania
              on June 12-15, 1996. Topics will include  combinatorial identities and
              enumeration, combinatorial  structures, and graph theory, with roughly one day
              devoted to  each topic.  This conference is in the general area of
              Combinatorics. One of  the  goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods
              of  studying how  discrete collections of objects can be arranged.  The
              behavior of  discrete systems is extremely important to  modern communications.
               For example, the design of large  networks,such as those occurring in 
              telephone systems, and the  design of algorithms in computer science  deal with
              discrete sets  of objects, and this makes use of  combinatorial research.
