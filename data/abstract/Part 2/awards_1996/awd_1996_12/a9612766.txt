Abstract    :
                    Abstract  EEC-9612766  Ni    This award provides funding for a second
              five-year continuing  grant to support the Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for Dimensional Measurement and Control in Manufacturing at the
              University of Michigan.    The Center has established a strong research program
              and has achieved tremendous success in terms of research, technology transfer,
              industrial involvement, and spin-off activities.  The Center will conduct
              research in the following areas:    1.) Dimensional measurement;  2.)
              Dimensional control for formed parts (including stamping and assembly);  3.)
              Dimensional control for machined parts.    Currently there are eight active
              industrial members involved in the Centers' research projects.
