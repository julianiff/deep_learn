Abstract    :
                  Abstract  EEC-9612524  Silevitch    This award is to provide funding for
              continuing support of the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
              (IUCRC) on Electromagnetics at Northeastern University.  When the IUCRC was
              founded, the mission was to educate students and foster research for the
              electromagnetics industry; radar, microwave and aerospace companies producing
              high-tech products.  The industry has changed over the years since the IUCRC
              was founded, and the emphasis in the research has changed to remain at the
              forefront of this field.  The new thrusts for the center include
              ground-penetrating radar, thin-film ferrite devices, advanced radar signal
              processing, medical optics and electromagnetics, wireless communications, and
              ultrasound imaging.    Additional funding is provided in this award to support
              a minority or woman student to participate in the Center's ongoing research
              program.  The student will perform computer modeling of optical oximetry in
              human tissue using an existing Monte-Carlo program.  The goal will be to
              determine the depth of measurement of oxygen saturation in different tissue
              models.  ??
