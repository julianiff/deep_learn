Abstract    :
              This application is for the purchase of a narrow bore 600  MHz NMR spectrometer
              which will be placed in an  established  NMR spectroscopy center.  A common
              interest of this group of  investigators is the application of 13C and 1H NMR 
              isotopomer analysis for metabolic studies.  Over the last 10  years we have
              developed the tools for unraveling the  metabolic information provided by
              13C-13C and 13C-1H  coupling in tissue metabolizing 13C enriched compounds. 
              Although these methods were refined largely for  interpretation of spectra from
              the isolated heart, it has  become clear over the last year that isotopomer
              analysis is  applicable to quantitation of complex pathways in other  tissues
              and for metabolic studies in humans.  The basic reason for this request is to
              improve sensitivity  and chemical shift dispersion to allow more reliable 
              quantitative analysis of metabolic pathways. This advance  will allow the use
              of smaller samples including the isolated  mouse heart or a few mls of human
              blood, better time  resolution in our kinetic studies of intact tissues, and 
              additional 13C fractional enrichment data provided by a  single 2D
              heteronuclear multiple bond correlation spectrum,  all of which will
              dramatically improve our ability to  exploit the power of isotopomer analysis
              to interrogate  intermediary metabolism.  Our view is that for the next  decade
              at least, the single most fruitful method for the  analysis of intermediary
              metabolism will be 13C and 1H NMR  spectroscopy.  Although in vivo 1H and 13C
              NMR spectroscopy  is the most exciting application of isotopomer analysis, it 
              is unlikely that appropriate whole-body MRI/MRS systems at  the necessary field
              will be widely available any time soon  for clinical research.  On the other
              hand, analytical NMR  spectrometers suitable for isotopomer studies of human
              blood  or urine are already in place in virtually every medical  school in this
              country.  We will apply these powerful  methods in cell culture, small animal
              models and in human  voluntee rs, with the ultimate goal of using isotopomer 
              analysis for evaluation of intermediary metabolism in  patients.
