Abstract    :
              9612674  Bluestein        While much progress has been over the last decade in 
              understanding the  structural characteristics of tornadoes and their parent 
              thunderstorms, many questions  still remain unanswered.  Among these are  What
              are the critical  factors that  actually trigger  convection and tornadoes?    
                   This is a three-year project whose objective is to understand  better the
              ways  in which severe convective storms form and behave. A combination of 
              analyses of  data from the Verification of Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes 
              Experiment  (VORTEX) conducted in the Southern Plains of the U. S. in 1994 and 
              1995,  conventional data sets, and advanced mesoscale numerical weather  models
              will be  used to achieve the objectives of this research.  Areas of focus 
              include the effects of  small-scale variations in surface characteristics and
              clouds on  storms initiated near  the dryline, tornadogenesis, and the
              relationship between the  environment and the  mode of initial storm formation
              on the subsequent evolution of  severe convective  storms. The results of this
              research will improve our ability to  forecast severe  weather in the Plains
              region of the U. S.              ***
