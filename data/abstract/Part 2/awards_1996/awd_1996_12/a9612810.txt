Abstract    :
              The PIs will perform a full calibration of a high performance, solid state (CCD)
              imaging system using a recently completed calibration laboratory at Utah State
              University.   They will also make extensive field tests at Bear Lake
              Observatory, in conjunction with all-sky NIR imaging and narrow field Michelson
              interferometer measurements of the zenith OH emission to characterize the
              instrumental response under a range of geophysical conditions.  Specialized
              software for the automatic control of the camera and for the detailed
              two-dimensional spectral analysis of the image data, including the derivation
              of temperature maps, will be developed.  Finally, the PI will conduct an
              observational program for the entirety of the project, including measurements
              with the MSX satellite, and culminating in a series of novel observations
              investigating short period mesospheric gravity wave temperature and intensity
              characteristics and their seasonal behavior at mid-latitudes.
