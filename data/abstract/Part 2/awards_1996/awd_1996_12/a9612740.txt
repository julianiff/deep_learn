Abstract    :
              Abstract  Lyons  9612740    The PI proposes to carry out an experimental
              investigation aimed at making velocity field and scalar field measurements in
              turbulent diffusion flames (nonlifted, lifted, and acoustically forced). 
              Particle image velocimetry (PIV) will be used to obtain velocity data while
              planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) will be used to image scalar fields
              such as those of CH and OH.  The goals of the research are: (1) to measure
              velocity fields in turbulent methane jet flames, (2) to measure the velocity
              field near the point of stabilization in lifted diffusion flames, (3) to couple
              these velocity field measurements with the scalar field measurements to better
              understand how the fllowfield interacts with the combustion front, and (4) to
              assess the effects of acoustic forcing on the behavior of lifted flames.
