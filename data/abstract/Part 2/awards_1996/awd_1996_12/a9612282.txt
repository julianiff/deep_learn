Abstract    :
              9612282  Jacob           In this project, 3-dimensional chemical models will be
              used to investigate issues in  tropospheric chemistry.  (1)  The export of
              nitrogen oxides from North America to the global atmosphere in different 
              seasons, and the role played by non-methane hydrocarbons in modifying this
              export, will be  quantified. Large amounts of nitrogen oxides are emitted by
              fossil fuel combustion in North  America, but only a fraction of this material
              is exported out of the continental boundary layer  where it affects
              tropospheric chemistry on a global scale.   (2)  The contribution of fossil
              fuel combustion in North America to concentrations of nitrogen  oxide in the
              remote troposphere will be determined by expanding the scale of the
              3-dimensional  model from continental-scale to the northern hemisphere. The
              ultimate fate of the nitrogen oxides  exported from North America, and its
              influence on global tropospheric chemistry, will be  investigated.   (3) The
              factors controlling the concentration of nitrogen and hydrogen oxide radicals
              in the upper  troposphere will be studied. These chemical factors are currently
              poorly understood. A  comprehensive theoretical study will be conducted,
              supported by data from recent and upcoming  aircraft campaigns, in order to
              define the different regimes and to examine the sensitivity to  chemical and
              meteorological variables.   (4) The sources of atmospheric acetone are
              currently not known quantitatively. A 3-dimensional  model study of acetone and
              its non-methane hydrocarbon precursors will be conducted. Detailed  comparisons
              of simulated and observed atmospheric concentrations in different regions will
              be  carried out.
