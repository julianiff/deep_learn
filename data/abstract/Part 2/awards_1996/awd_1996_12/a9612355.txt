Abstract    :
              This is a 3-year standard award. Computer support for  meeting scheduling is a
              focus of active research in several  areas, including distributed artificial
              intelligence (DAI)  and intelligent agents, software engineering, and 
              information systems. It is also of very high applied  interest. However,
              meeting scheduling is most significant in  being one of the first desktop group
              support applications  that is widely used in some organizations. The
              researchers  will conduct empirical studies of the use of this group  support
              technology in settings where existing technical  infrastructures and
              organizational practices enable all  employees, numbering hundreds or
              thousands, to fully  participate in the use of a shared system. A deep 
              understanding of successful practice will itself extend  knowledge of
              organizational behavior in this new  technological context, and it can also
              guide the research  and application of technologies and approaches developed in
               the fields mentioned above. The researchers will conduct  detailed interviews,
              longitudinal observational studies, and  broad surveys to determine factors
              underlying the success of  particular applications, adoption trajectory within 
              organizations, and emergent behaviors including differences  in successful use
              across settings. They will also explore  the possibility of using this
              newly-emergent technology to  better understand issues of coordination of work
              and  technological impact within firms.
