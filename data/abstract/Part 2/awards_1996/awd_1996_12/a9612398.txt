Abstract    :
              9612398  Gutierrez    Gutierrez is Professor of Chemistry and Director of both
              the  National Institutes of Health (NIH) Minority Access to Research  Careers
              (MARC) and the Minority Biomedical Research Support (MBRS)  Programs at
              California State University at Los Angeles. His  accomplishments include:     
              I.   Significant impact on minority student college and university      
              education through his work on NIH funded projects -- over 180       students
              mentored by him through these programs or his role as       a faculty
              participant in other department projects such as the       NSF Research
              Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) and       Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) Programs;      II.  Significant institutional impact --
              the American Chemical       Society (ACS), in great part through his effort,
              established       the Committee on Minority Affairs in 1993 with Gutierrez     
               serving as its first chair, which in turn established the ACS       Minority
              Scholars Program, a $5 million scholarship program       for undergraduates;
              and the establishment of the ACS Award for       Encouraging Disadvantaged
              Students to Pursue Careers in       Chemical Sciences.    -- as Vice Chair of
              the National Academy of Science Committee on    a National Scholars Program,
              under contract to NASA, he has    articulated persuasively the responsibility
              of all faculty, but    especially science faculty, to seek out talented
              minority    students and encourage their academic development very early in   
              their undergraduate career; and      III. Beyond individual students, Gutierrez
              has effected an entire       cohort of future science professionals.
