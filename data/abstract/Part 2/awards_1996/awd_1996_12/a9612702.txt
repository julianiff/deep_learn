Abstract    :
              The specific aims of this research include the synthesis of a homologous  
              series of sterol conjugates by use of amino- and amino acid-derived  
              hexa(ethylene glycol), hexaglycine, hexaalanine and spermine; the   preparation
              of a macrocyclic sterol dimer containing a tridecaethylene   glycol chain; the
              synthesis of a series of oligomers based on spermine   and substituted cholic
              acid; and, the examination of ion transport   kinetics and pore-forming
              properties of each of the above amphiphiles by   means of 23Na Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.  With this   award, the Organic Dynamics Program
              is supporting the research of Dr.   Steven L. Regen of the Department of
              Chemistry at Lehigh University.    Professor Regen will focus his work on
              defining  the influence that   charge, hydrogen bonding, end group interactions
              and oligomerization have   on the pore-forming properties of sterol-based
              compounds known as   amphiphiles.  The goal of the work is to learn how to
              control the   monomer-aggregate equilibrium of such amphiphiles within lipid
              bilayers   that mimic the plasma membrane of bacterial, fungal and mammalian
              cells.    The long range goal of the work is to provide a foundation for the  
              rational design of new classes of antibiotics.
