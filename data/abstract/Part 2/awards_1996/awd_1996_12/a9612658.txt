Abstract    :
              This project gathers some of the principal cast of IR coronal experimenters in a
              concerted effort to mount a decisive campaign from an aircraft platform at the
              total solar eclipse of February 1998.  The objectives are fourfold:  (1) survey
              the intermediate infrared spectral region for the presence of coronal emission
              lines, to add diagnostic capability in coronal studies; (2) conduct photometric
              measurements of the infrared coronal radiance, to specify the relative roles of
              thermal emission and scattering from the interplanetary dust comprising the
              F-corona; (3) measure the spectral shift of Fraunhofer lines in the coronal
              signal to determine the motion of interplanetary dust near the sun, and
              understand previously reported variations from Keplerian orbital motion; and
              (4) study the He I 1083 nm radiation observed at the 1994 eclipse in the outer
              corona by means of line profile measurements.
