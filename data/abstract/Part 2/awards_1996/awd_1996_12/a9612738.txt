Abstract    :
              This project continues studying many areas of solar physics able to be addressed
              by radio observations.  Using primarily three radio telescopes (i.e., the Very
              Large Array of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, the
              Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Millimeter Array at Hat Creek, and the Nobeyama
              Radioheliograph), the PI will continue analyzing flares observed over the past
              few years, and non-flare studies appropriate to the current minimum phase of
              the solar cycle.  Specifically, the PI will:  (1) compare photospheric magnetic
              fields with high-quality VLA images, deducing the presence of strong currents
              from extrapolated coronal fields in determining the magnetic field in the
              active region corona; (2) study the large scale structure of the X-ray corona
              above strong sunspot magnetic fields associated with microwave gyroresonance
              emission; (3) study limb darkening, active region filament channels, bright
              prints and networks in detail; (4) study evolution of active regions in
              microwaves in relation to their flare productivity; (5) use simultaneously
              obtained imaging data to study the X-ray counterparts of type II bursts; (6)
              study filament eruptions in X-rays, microwaves and their relations to coronal
              mass ejections; and (7) observe both microwave and meterwave radio emission
              associated with dynamic coronal X-ray jets.
