Abstract    :
              9630780  Stitt  Certain Escherichia coli that contain a mutated  transcription
              termination factor Rho exhibit faster messenger RNA degradation rates and
              drastically reduce gene expression of infecting T4 bacteriophage. These
              phenotypes suggest a novel function for Rho in message degradation. An in vivo
              message degradation system will be used to compare the rate and pattern of
              degradation of specific mRNAs in wild type and rho(nusD) mutant cell extracts.
              Experiments will be performed to distinguish between two hypotheses to explain
              the altered message turnover: increased nuclease activity and increased message
              susceptibility to nucleases. In particular, Rho will be tested for a proposed
              role in the protection of RNA from degradation.  Two means of overcoming the
              effects of the rho mutation have been found. First, spontaneous mutants in a
              new T4 gene, goF, restore the ability of T4 to grow in rho mutant cells.
              Second, introduction of the plasmid pBR322 into the rho mutant cells also
              renders them permissive for T4 growth. The rop gene of pBR322 has been found to
              be responsible for this phenotypic reversal, and the Rop protein is the
              critical molecule. Expression of either Rop or GoF1 in E. coli lengthens mRNA
              lifetimes, restoring those in rho(nusD) mutant cells to normal values and
              lengthening those in rho+ cells. The in vitro message degradation system will
              be used to determine the effects of Rop and GoFl on message turnover. Affinity
              chromatography and gel shift techniques will be used to identify interacting
              molecules in this system.  The proposed work will characterize new and
              previously unsuspected roles for transcription termination factor Rho and
              pBR322 Rop in the control of mRNA degradation.  ***
