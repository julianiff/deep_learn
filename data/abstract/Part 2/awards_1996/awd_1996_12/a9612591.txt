Abstract    :
              9612591  Lasser    Lasser is Director of Programs for Educational Enrichment and
               Retention (PEER) at Clemson. Lasser s accomplishments include:    o
              Development and implementation of PEER, a mentoring-based    program, that has
              demonstrated success by taking Clemson from an    unacceptably low minority
              graduation rate to 13th in the Nation    (fifth among majority schools) in
              numbers of African-American    engineering graduates;       o Direct training
              of 88 minority engineering upper-class students    as mentors who then mentor
              entering minority engineer majors --    PEER s success is documented by the
              freshman-to-sophomore    retention rate, which exceeds 80% annually;    o
              Students success in pursuit of advanced degrees in engineering -    - of the 67
              African-American PEER mentors who have already    graduated from Clemson, 25
              (nearly 38%) are currently in or have    completed some postbaccalaureate
              degree), while of the 21    current undergraduate mentors, eight, nearly
              one-third, plan to    attend graduate school;      o Publications on mentoring
              and diversity
