Abstract    :
              9612352   Rajurkar   Sometimes the best or only alternative to processing
              complex or intricate shapes in advanced and difficult to machine materials is
              by electrical discharge machining (EDM).  However, state of the art EDM
              equipment cannot economically produce many complex cavities, threaded or
              twisted surfaces characteristic of airfoils, and is not designed for
              integration into new generations of agile manufacturing systems.  This project
              will develop a new computer numerical controlled (CNC) six degree of freedom
              EDM system capable of producing complex cavities.   The six degree of freedom
              device will use a specially designed three axis CNC tooling unit mounted on a
              commercial three axis CNC-EDM.  In addition to the articulation provided by
              this design, this new machine's controller will incorporate the investigator's
              research results for EDM gap monitoring, six axis CNC interpolation, and motion
              generation for conjugate machining and complex shape generation.  The prototype
              machine will  be a major leap forward in the technology of EDM tools; capable
              of ready integration into agile manufacturing systems for producing complex
              shapes in high performance alloys.       This project will advance the science
              and technology of EDM process tools, and it will help U.S. producers and users
              of precision EDM advance their manufacturing base.
