Abstract    :
              This project will determine quantitative properties and causes of high-latitude
              F-region and topside ionospheric zone upflows.  The PI will systematically
              examine the effects of at le4ast three candidate magnetospheric 'drivers' for
              such upflows:  (1) effects of soft electron precipitation; (2) downward
              magnetospheric heat fluxes; and (3) convection-driven frictional ion heating. 
              His methods used will be:  (1) ionospheric fluid studies, (2) analysis of
              200-800 km profiles of ionospheric plasma density, temperature and field
              aligned flow velocity measurements, and (3) analysis of DE-2 measurements of
              ionospheric and magnetospheric particles and fields.  Preliminary
              investigations the PI has performed have produced two model-data comparison
              papers, which indicate in quantitative detail the importance of the soft
              electron precipitation effects as well as the magnetospheric electron heat
              fluxes.  In addition, ion upfluxes significantly correlate with electron and
              temperatures, and ion field-aligned velocities have a direct relationship with
              the computed ambipolar electric field.  Finally, substantial upflows occur only
              for soft electron precipitation average energies less than 100 eV.  Further
              studies will be of widespread interest to CEDAR and the general ionospheric
              community.
