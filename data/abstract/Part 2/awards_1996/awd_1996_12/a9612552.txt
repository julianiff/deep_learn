Abstract    :
              9612552  Parr     This workshop will develop plans for a conference to 
              encourage cooperation between statisticians in academia,  industry, and
              government. The conference which will follow  is expected to develop and
              disseminate a model for  partnerships between academia, industry and government
              that  could be extended to other disciplines. It is also expected  to foster
              faster development, testing, and transfer of  relevant leading edge knowledge
              into practice.     This award is consistent with the GOALI aims, and will 
              synergize university-industry partnerships.
