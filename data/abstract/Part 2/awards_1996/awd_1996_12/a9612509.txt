Abstract    :
                9612509  Campbell    The Arabian Sea is an intensely dynamic region of the 
              world's  oceans driven by strong seasonal reversals in  monsoon winds.  The
              region is interesting in the context of  the Joint Global spatial  scales
              "extremes" in ocean  production systems -coastal upwelling  to open ocean 
              oligotrophic -- under relatively constant tropical  illumination.  It is thus a
              natural laboratory to test  conceptual  linkages among physical forcing,
              food-wed  structure, biogeochemical cycling and fluxes, and carbon  burial in
              the sediments.  The general goals of this project  are to asses the roles of
              microzooplankton as consumers of  bacterial and phytoplankton production and to
              contribute to  nderstanding the relationships  among plankton community 
              structure, new production, and biogeochemical fluxes and  their responses to
              physical forcing the  Arabian Sea.  The  project is to be conducted during the
              spring  (April)  intermonsoon and summer (August) SW monsoon seasons, when  the
              most dramatic differences should be evident.  Abundance,  biomass, and specific
              growth rates of bacteria and  phytoplankton  will be determined by flow
              cytometric,  microscopic, and pigment analyses to determine their  variations
              with season, depth and  location.  The dominant  microzooplankton grazers on
              pico- and  nanoplankton will be  identified and quantified, and the impact of 
              their grazing  will be measured with a suite of complementary  methods 
              including dilution, fluorescently-labelled prey, size-  fractionation, and
              specific metabolic inhibitors.  Results  of this  project will contribute to
              understanding how global  climate changes, which may affect prevailing forcing
              winds,  will alter phytoplankton community structure and in turn how  these
              changes in  structure of the food web affect carbon  storage and export from
              the  upper water column.  ***
