Abstract    :
              9612522  Wilson  In this research, we develop a design framework of novel signal
              processing hierarchies   and architectures for distributed sensing systems.  We
              propose to explore a design   methodology that combines analog VLSI for
              customizing front-end signal processing on   the sensing plane with generic
              processing centers located off the sensing plane for   performing back-end
              processing directed toward more complex feature analysis.  We seek   to apply
              these distributed signal processing architectures to arrays of sensors that are
                distributed within and fused across various sensing planes.  These sensing
              planes may be   of the same type of sensor but placed at different locations in
              the sensing environment.    Alternatively, different types of sensing planes
              can be fused for more accurate recognition   and confirmation of objects of
              interest.  The applications of distributed systems of this   type of
              architecture are numerous and diverse.  The phase of research proposed here
              does   not seek to build systems that satisfy all of these applications nor
              even systems for a   substantial subset of these applications.  Rather, this
              research develops a framework for   building and testing novel architectures to
              be applied to the longer-term design of  low-  cost, distributed sensing
              systems that have the capability to process large numbers of   sensing stations
              and sensory points in a variety of environments.  ***
