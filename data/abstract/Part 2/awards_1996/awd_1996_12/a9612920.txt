Abstract    :
              This project will primarily investigate the dynamical, chemical and coupling
              effects of the quasi-two-day wave in the middle and upper atmosphere.  The PI
              will accomplish this task by first developing a set of analytical tools
              designed to aid in the analysis of
              Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model
              (TIME-GCM) simulations.  These tools, once developed, will be incorporated into
              the model postprocessor, and made available to the whole CEDAR community. 
              Additionally, model simulations will be validated with data from a set of
              Global-Scale Wave Model (GSWM) simulations, and data collected from the world
              day observational period during January 1993.  Once the model simulations are
              validated, the TIME-GCM simulations will be analyzed to unravel the complex
              interactions which occur in the middle and upper atmosphere relating to the
              quasi-two-day wave.
