Abstract    :
              This short-term research project will address the challenge of achieving near
              PetaOps scale performance within a decade through innovative systems that
              exhibit wide applicability and ease of use.  The objective of the proposed
              research is to determine the feasibility and detailed structure of a parallel
              architecture integrating the combined capabilities of semiconductor,
              superconductor, and optical technologies.  This hybrid architecture approach is
              motivated by the realization that a mix of technologies may yield superior
              operational attributes to those possible based solely on semiconductor
              technology in the same time frame.  An interdisciplinary team of collaborators
              has been assembled to conduct the required point-design study in order to
              devise a complete system structure and evaluate its performance characteristics
              using a small set of scientific application kernels.  The proposed hybrid
              technology approach exploits critical opportunities enabled by key emerging
              devices.  Specifically computational performance can be dramatically improved
              through recent advances in Superconducting Rapid Single Flux Quantum logic
              which will make 100 Ghz clock rates feasible in the next two years.  Memory
              capacity may be drastically increased through a new memory hierarchy, merging
              advanced semiconductor high density memory and future (admittedly more
              speculative) optical 3-D holographic storage capable of storing 0.1 Petabits or
              more.  Interconnection bandwidth will be greatly enhanced by means of optical
              networks with 100 Gbps channels.
