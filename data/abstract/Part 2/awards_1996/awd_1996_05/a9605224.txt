Abstract    :
              This international collaboration between the PI and John Allen of Lund
              University,   Sweden has two objectives.  One is to further characterize redox
              control of the   phosphorylation of membrane proteins from chloroplasts of
              higher plants, cyanobacterial   thylakoid membranes, and chromatophores from
              purple bacteria.  The primary method   used will be potentiometric redox
              titration and phosphorimaging.  The other is to   determine the roles of
              individual phosphoproteins in controlling light-energy harvesting   and
              distribution, as well as photosynthetic electron transfer.  The main method
              used there   will be fluorescence spectroscopy to probe both single turnover
              and steady-state electron   transfer.  The Lund laboratory will provide
              equipment and resources needed to perform   the research.  The result of the
              collaboration could lead to a breakthrough in our   understanding of a process
              fundamental to photosynthesis, and could have application to   other cell
              systems.
