Abstract    :
              9605197  Somasundaran  Description:  This award is for the US-India Cooperative 
              Research: Dispersion-Flocculation Phenomena in Colloidal Oxide  Suspensions at
              Low Concentrations of Polymers.  The collaborators  are Dr. P. Somasundaran,
              Department of Chemical Engineering,  Columbia University and Dr. Pradip of the
              Tata Research,  Development & Design Centre, Pune, India.  This research will 
              focus on usage of combinations of low polymer concentrations for  flocculation
              of oxide minerals.  The motivation stems from novel  results obtained from a
              current project on iron oxide-alumina  where at low concentrations of
              polyacrylic acid, it was found  that alumina can be effectively flocculated. 
              The researchers  will study the fundamental mechanisms of polymer-polymer, 
              particle-particle and polymer-particle interactions in order  reach the goal of
              this research which is to develop a unified  theory of polymeric flocculation. 
              The knowledge gained from this  study will help develop strategies for an
              industrially important  and technologically challenging problem--the selective
              separation  of fine particulates in general and oxide suspensions in 
              particular.    Scope:  This project supports pioneering research at two well 
              regarded laboratories and between scientists with complementary  expertise and
              excellent research track records.  Students in   both countries will be
              involved in the research.  The project  enhances international collaboration in
              an area of high  scientific interest and mutual benefit.  The project meets INT
               objectives.  ***
