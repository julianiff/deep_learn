Abstract    :
                This award supports a three-year collaborative research project between Dr.
              Carl D. Hopkins, Professor of Neurobiology at Cornell University, and Dr.
              Brahim Ibrahim, of the Department de Biologie at the Universite des Sciences et
              Techniques in Gabon.  The investigators will study waveform variations in the
              electric organ discharges (EOD) of various species of mormyrid fishes to
              determine the phylogenetic history of the variations and the roles that
              evolution and sex differences have in the EOD waveform in order to produce an
              understanding of the morphological and physiological basis for the variations. 
              The mormyrid fishes, which comprise the largest group of freshwater fish in
              Africa, are only found in West Africa, and little research has been done on
              them.  This cooperative project combines the expertise in electric fish
              neuroethology of Dr. Hopkins with Dr. Ibrahim's expertise in electrophysiology
              and pharmacology.    This study will contribute important new information to
              the existing knowledge about the mormyrid fishes in West Africa and how they
              have evolved.   The grant will also provide support for a junior investigator
              to participate in an international research activity.
