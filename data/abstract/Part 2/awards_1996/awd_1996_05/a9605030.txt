Abstract    :
              9605030  Peressini    This  study will provide systematic information about the
              nature of two reform-based teacher education programs and their impact on
              prospective teachers.  The researchers will follow a number of preservice
              secondary mathematics teachers as they participate in two university-based
              teacher education programs and through their first two years of teaching, in
              order to study closely how teacher education impacts their learning and
              development as mathematics teachers.  Data will be gathered predominantly
              through semi-structured interviews, observations, and the collection and
              analysis of artifacts.  The data gathering process will be organized around
              participants' knowledge and beliefs, participants' teaching, university teacher
              education experiences, and public school experiences.  Products will be
              conference presentations, peer-reviewed journal articles, and postings to a
              website.
