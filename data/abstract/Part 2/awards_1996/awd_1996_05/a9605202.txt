Abstract    :
                This two-year award for cooperation on digital libraries involves Daniel E.
              Atkins and   William Birmingham at the University of Michigan, and the European
              Research   Consortium for Informatics and Applied Mathematics (ERCIM), which
              consists of the   national computer and information science laboratories of 14
              European countries.  The   award supports the establishment of four
              international working groups to foster an   international community of Digital
              Library researchers and to identify joint research   agendas.  The working
              groups will focus on technical issues related to interoperability,   metadata,
              optimized retrieval, and intellectual property and economics.  Meetings will be
                organized to examine and define critical research questions through which
              joint research   proposals will emerge.  The University of Michigan serves as
              the U.S. organizer.  Each   working group will consist of five U.S. researchers
              from NSF-supported Digital Library   Projects and other research organizations
              and five European researchers.  The project   takes advantage of significant
              European expertise in informatics and applied mathematics   and will eventually
              provide access to a large compendium of scientific information that is  
              produced in Europe.  Through this cooperation, common standards and strategies
              to   develop compatible systems and global digital libraries are likely to
              emerge.
