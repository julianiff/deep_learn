Abstract    :
              INT 9605174  Roberts        This U.S.-Czech collaborative effort headed by Fred
              Roberts of Rutgers University's Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical
              Computer Sciences (DIMACS) and Jaroslav Nesetril of Charles University's Center
              for Discrete Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science and Applications
              (DIMATIA) will forge a link between the two centers of excellence with the
              intent of focussing their combined expertise on challenging problems in areas
              pertaining to discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science.    The
              three year program of joint activities will feature workshops on: 1)
              applications of the probabilistic method, 2) probabilistic techniques in
              computational geometry, and 3) complexity of computations and logical
              deductions.  Coupled with the conduct of each of these workshops will be an
              extended visit program for selected participants who apply to work on problems
              central to the workshop themes.  Selections will be made by a DIMACS/DIMATIA
              steering committee, with some priority given to junior, postdoc and graduate
              student participants.  Overall, the subsequent linkage of sister centers is
              expected to yield long-term research interactions and important breakthroughs
              in combinatorics.         This cooperative project between two centers of
              excellence fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
              enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
              complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence.    ??
