Abstract    :
              9605028  Lee    This award provides funds to support a long-term research  visit
              by Dr. Kwang Y. Lee, Intelligent Distributed Controls  Research Laboratory,
              Department of Electrical and Computer  Engineering, Pennsylvania State
              University, for collaboration  with Dr. Takashi Hiyama, Department of
              Electrical and  Computer Engineering, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan. 
              Their research is concerned with the development of power  system intelligent
              coordinated control.  The purpose of  intelligent coordinated control is to
              improve power  generation reliability, economy, and safety through the 
              implementation of modern control technologies and artificial  intelligence.   
              The research will be conducted primarily in the Kumamoto  Electric Power
              Systems Laboratory at Kumamoto University.  During the visit, Dr. Lee also will
              be working with the  Kyushu Electric Power Company in experimenting with the
              power  system intelligent coordinated control concepts in its Power  System
              Analysis Simulator.  The U.S. and Japanese  collaborators have been engaged
              independently in parallel  research in this area and share a common interest in
              training  students and other researchers in the required skills to  develop,
              test, and implement advanced control techniques in  actual power plants and
              power systems.  The collaborators  expect the present collaboration to allow
              them to expand  their current research from the power plant to the power 
              system level and integrate their various capabilities for  mutual benefit. 
              This project is supported under the Science  Fellowship Program between the
              National Science Foundation  and the Japan Foundation Center for Global
              Partnership.  ***
