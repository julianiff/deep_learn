              W..  AST-9605012      Funds will be used to upgrade the MDM/Ohio State/ALADDIN 
              (MOSAIC) Infrared Camera and imaging spectrometer to full  coverage of the J,
              H, and K' spectral bands.  At present  MOSAIC covers only the J and K bands. 
              The instrument will  be used on telescopes at Kitt Peak including the 4 meter
              and  2.1 meter KPNO telescopes and the 2.4 meter Hiltner  telescope.
