Abstract    :
              University of Southern California   The research will investigate the influence
              of urban population diversity-cultural, economic, socio-demographic and
              ethico-political-on the formation of attitudes toward animals.  Attitudes
              toward animals are critical to understand, because they underpin the social
              construction of animals and animality by human society.  The initial goals are
              to refine a conceptual framework for understanding urban population diversity
              and attitudes toward animals, based on current theoretic approaches and a meta
              analysis of past studies.  In addition, the spectrum of attitudes and behaviors
              toward various types of animals and the dimension of urban diversity which may
              be related to attitudes toward animals will be identified.  Expert interviews
              and focus groups will be carried out to discover information on attitudes,
              behaviors and conflict.  This information then will be utilized to design a
              survey instrument which allows a description of attitudinal variation with
              respect to animals.  In addition the research will develop a conceptual
              typology of local animal management institutions and urban animal social
              movement organizations to inform the design of appropriate methodologies for
              larger scale data collection efforts and criteria for case study selection.
