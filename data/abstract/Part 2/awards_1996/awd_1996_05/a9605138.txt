Abstract    :
              ***  Ellis  This grant will support summer research at Wesleyan  University for
              eight undergraduates for five years.  Half of  the stipends will be given to
              women recruited from similarly  sized institutions in the New England area. 
              The impact of  the support will be three-fold.  First, the positions will  add
              Wesleyan summer research opportunities to the limited  pool of opportunities
              available to women at similar  institutions in the Northeast.  Second, the
              emphasis on  women will continue to nurture a receptive environment for  women
              in physics both at Wesleyan and in the Northeast.  Finally, the emphasis on
              research among physics  undergraduates will be strengthened by the presence of
              this  stable source of support, contributing to the unique  combination of a
              small liberal arts setting and graduate  research that exists at Wesleyan.  The
              research positions  will involve projects associated with ongoing research 
              efforts primarily in condensed matter and atomic/molecular  experimental
              physics.  ***
