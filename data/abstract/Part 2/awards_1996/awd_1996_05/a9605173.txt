Abstract    :
                This three-year award supports US-France cooperative research in programming  
              languages between Benjamin C. Pierce of Indiana University and Davide Sangiorgi
              of   INRIA (French National Institute for Research in Informatics and Applied
              Mathematics)   at Sophia Antipolis, France.  The objective of their research is
              to study the use of static   type information for reasoning about concurrent
              systems through applications of process   calculi.  Previous work in this area
              has shown that systems with subtyping and linearity   can be `transplanted`
              from sequential programming languages to a pure calculus of   message-passing
              concurrency.  These refinements have benefits in flexibility and detection   of
              programming errors and can be used to justify useful program equivalences. 
              This work   will be extended to investigations on the role of parametric
              polymorphism and various   forms of noninterference between concurrent
              activities.    The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in
              design and implementation of   concurrent object-oriented languages and in
              theoretical studies of type systems.  This is   complemented by the French
              investigator's experience in concurrency theory and process   calculi.
