Abstract    :
              9605178  Sharma  Description:  This award supports the US-India Cooperative 
              Research: Study of Molecular Motions and Phase Transformations  in Atomic-Scale
              Structures and Liquid Crystals.  The project is  under the direction of S.C.
              Sharma, University of Texas at  Arlington (UTA) and P.C. Jain, University of
              Delhi (UD).  The  researchers will study the effects of molecular structure on
              phase  transition in liquid crystalline materials and will investigate 
              relationships between defects and optical properties of surface-  aligned
              liquid crystalline films.  Using techniques sensitive to phase  transition,
              they will measure optical properties of surface-aligned  liquid crystalline
              thin films.  The outcome will be a better  understanding of the processes
              occurring at the surface and in the  bulk, and their effects on the optical
              properties of a much broader  class of layered materials.    Scope:  This
              collaboration will initiate a new joint research  program between the
              University of Texas and the University of  Delhi.  The PIs are established
              researchers who have published  important results obtained from their
              experimental techniques.   Both the expertise and facilities available at UTA
              and UD are  complementary.  This project has excellent potential for addressing
               important scientific questions and improving the quality of liquid 
              crystalline films and other materials. The research is mutually  beneficial and
              the support requested is primarily for travel and per  diem.    ***
