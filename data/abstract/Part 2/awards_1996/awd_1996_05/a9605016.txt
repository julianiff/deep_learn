Abstract    :
                This dissertation enhancement grant supports a US graduate student, Monibo A.
              Sam, working under the guidance of Dr. Josef Gugler, Professor of Sociology at
              the University of Connecticut, to do field research in Nigeria.  The project
              will study the structural and societal variables that impact on the survival
              rates of micro- and small-scale enterprises (MSEs) in Nigeria.  In developing
              countries MSEs are often seen as the solution to poverty, unemployment, and
              unequal income distribution.  But MSEs in Subsaharan Africa countries are
              especially vulnerable to failure when their founder dies.  Through archival
              research and interviews, Mr. Sam expects to define the variables that determine
              the success or failure of the MSEs.  Staff members of the  Department of
              Sociology at the University of Port Harcourt will collaborate with Mr. Sam on
              this project.      The results of this study should increase our knowledge
              about MSE survival rates in developing countries, and prove valuable to
              policymakers in Nigeria and other developing countries.  The grant will also
              provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong,
              independent research career.  Funding for this project is being provided
              jointly by the Division of International Programs and by the Division of
              Social, Behavioral, and Economic Research.
