Abstract    :
                9605179  Sander    This award will support cooperative research between 
              Professor Leonard Snader of the Department of Physics of the  University of 
              Michigan and Professor David Williams of the  Department of Physics of the
              Australian National University.  They will conduct a series of studies of
              elastically driven  kinetics and instabilities in thin solid films and lamellar
               materials, including both analytic and numerical  investigations.  The
              specific phenomena to be studied are:  1) island formation in heteroepitaxy, 2)
              elastically driven  instabilities in swelling/deswelling of lamellar membrane 
              phases, and 3) strain effects in rod-coil block copolymer  materials.
