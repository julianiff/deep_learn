Abstract    :
              ***  Vogt  The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) will  establish an
              REU Site under the aegis of the Laser  Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
              Observatory (LIGO)  Project.  LIGO, a collaborative effort between Caltech and 
              MIT scientists, is designed to make broad-band (~10 Hz - 10  kHz) observations
              of gravitational waves predicted by  General Relativity and generated by a
              variety of  astrophysical processes, including neutron stars, black  holes,
              supernovae and other sources yet to be discovered.  LIGO is sponsored by the
              National Science Foundation,  construction is underway at two observatory sites
              at  Hanford, Washington and Livingston Parish, Louisiana.  LIGO offers
              exceptional opportunities for involvement of  undergraduates in research.  LIGO
              detectors cover a large  number of physics disciplines and tools, including 
              metrology, optics, lasers, mechanical systems, controls, and  electronics. 
              LIGO observations are concerned with strong-  field gravitation and a large
              spectrum of astrophysical  phenomena, ranging from the Big Bang to neutro-star
              and  black-hole binaries to neutron-star creation in supernova  collapses.  But
              most of all, LIGO will open a new window  onto the universe through the new
              force medium of  gravitational waves and the information carried by them.  The
              LIGO project has a large and high caliber scientific  staff, which can serve as
              mentors for the undergraduate  students.  The LIGO REU Site will be under the
              jurisdiction  of Caltech, which has a tradition of excellence in  undergraduate
              science and engineering education.  ***
