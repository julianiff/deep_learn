Abstract    :
              To understand the spatial relationships among structures within  biological
              specimens, three-dimensional  imaging is required. Soft x-ray tomography offers
              the possibility to  image several micrometer thick  specimens at 30-100
              nanometer voxel resolution, unique contrast  mechanisms, and the ability to
              examine  hydrated specimens.    Nanotomography with soft x-ray optics will be
              developed by adding  tomography capabilities to a soft x-ray scanning
              transmission  microscope with a liquid nitrogen temperature stage. Fresnel zone
               plates will be used to focus a soft x-ray undulator beam to a 30-50  nanometer
              resolution probe (the smallest focused spot of  electromagnetic radiation of
              any wavelength), and the specimen will be  scanned through this probe at a
              range of tilt angles. The depth of  field is such that each image will
              represent a projection through the  specimen, at least in problems selected for
              initial studies. After  initial studies of freeze-dried specimens, hydrated
              specimens which  have been vitrified will be imaged at liquid nitrogen
              temperatures.    These novel nanotomography capabilities will be employed in
              ongoing and  new interdisciplinary studies with our biology collaborators at
              our  x-ray microscope user facility. These collaborations have included the 
              study of chromatin folding in metaphase chromosomes, imaging of the  malarial
              parasite P. falciparum, quantitative mapping of protein and  DNA concentrations
              to understand chromosome packing in sperm,  calcification in cartilage and bone
              (with implications for arthritis  and osteoporosis), and the localization of
              RNA transcription sites in  the nucleus.
