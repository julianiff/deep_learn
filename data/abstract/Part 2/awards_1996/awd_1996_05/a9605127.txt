Abstract    :
              9605127  Sterner    The University of Minnesota, through its field stations at
              Lake Itasca, the Gray Freshwater Institute, and the Cedar Creek natural area,
              hosts a summer-research program for undergraduate students, with emphasis on
              aquatic environmental science.  Building upon a distinguished record of
              training and research, emphasizing field-based research in modern limnology,
              the University's program immerses students in a highly interactive, ten-week
              session of research projects, seminars, workshops, and presentations.  A large
              staff of faculty mentors, augmented by visiting scientists during the summer,
              shares common interests in research related to water quality and the analyses
              of physical, chemical, and biological processes that occur in lakes, rivers,
              streams, and wetlands.  Minority-student participation as well as participation
              by women have been significant in past NSF-supported programs, and efforts are
              being made to continue those emphases.    The research components of the
              program include:  (1) student projects under the sponsorship of a mentor
              scientist, in which each student develops a research question and associated
              hypotheses, implements the project, collects and analyzes data; (2)
              presentation of brief oral reports in weekly student seminars; and (3)
              preparation of a summary of the research project in the form of a scientific
              poster for a campus-wide symposium.  An initial three-day orientation session,
              local field trips, and numerous seminars by visiting scientists complement
              these activities.
