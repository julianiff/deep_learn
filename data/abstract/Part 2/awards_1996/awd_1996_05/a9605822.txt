Abstract    :
              AST-9605822  George Wolf    The knowledge of many basic stellar properties is
              dependent on observations of binary stars.  The values for stellar absolute
              dimensions and masses, for example, are dependent on the study of the eclipsing
              members of the spectroscopic binary stars. This research project will use the
              techniques of CCD differential photometry to focus on (1) obtaining and
              analyzing light curves of known, but neglected, longer-period eclipsing
              binaries with double-line orbital solutions and (2) searching for new eclipsing
              binaries among known double-line spectroscopic binaries.  The major purpose of
              the research will be that of extending the base of known stellar properties,
              absolute dimensions and masses.    The long-term observations required for
              study of these types of binary stars are most effectively done at small
              observatories with focused observational priorities.  The astronomical
              observations and analysis for this research will be carried out mainly with the
              use of the CCD detector system on the modernized, semi-automated 0.4 meter
              telescope of the Baker Observatory at Southwest Missouri State University. 
              Undergraduate students, supported separately by a NASA grant to the Missouri
              Space Grant Consortium, will form an integral part of this research and will
              assist in all phases of the observations, data analysis and dissemination of
              the results.  ***
