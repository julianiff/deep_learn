Abstract    :
              INT 9605193  Johnson      This U.S.-Czech research project between Carl H.
              Johnson of Vanderbilt University and Ivana Machackova of the Czech Institute of
              Experimental Botany will examine the chemical basis of plant flowering. 
              Results should contribute to our basic understanding of the photoperiodic time
              measurement (PTM) system and the process of information transfer to flowering
              tissue, meristems, in plants.  Specifically, Drs. Johnson and Machackova plan
              to use the tobacco plant as the model system because much is known about PTM in
              tobacco and a variety of strains in the same genus display different
              photoperiodic phenotypes.    The researchers will build this inquiry upon
              recently discovered information about melatonin, a crucial hormone for PTM
              found animals, and new evidence suggesting that cytosolic free calcium fluxes
              are involved in the phototransduction pathway. Since melatonin is similarly
              found in higher plants, this project will attempt to determine the mechanisms
              controlling the circadian production of melatonin in plants and the roles, if
              any, played by melatonin and/or cytosolic free calcium in photoperiodic
              induction of flowering in higher plants.    This project in cell biology
              fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
              leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
              complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence.   ??
