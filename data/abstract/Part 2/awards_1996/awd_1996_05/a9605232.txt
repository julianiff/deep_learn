Abstract    :
              INT 9605232  Vitek    This U.S.-Czech research project between Vaclav Vitek of
              the University of Pennsylvania and his partners, Vaclav Paidar of the Czech
              Institute of Physics and Mojmir Sob of the Czech Institute of the Physics of
              Materials, will examine metastable structures in the lamellar TiAl (titanium
              aluminum), a ductile intermetallic compound.  The research plan entails
              analyzing configurations produced by large scale distortions that transform the
              initial structure creating new structures with different symmetries. Two types
              of distortions will be considered: 1) large homogeneous straining and 2)
              shuffling of atomic planes.    The collaborative work is expected to yield new
              knowledge about these atomic interfacial structures, specifically, the lattice
              transformations connecting the interface, including dislocations and twin
              nuclei.  Results will help explain the high ductility and toughness of the
              lamellar TiAl by characterizing the bonding in an ideal lattice and in
              defective regions.  Such information may be useful in future production of
              strong, light density-high temperature tolerant intermetallic compounds for
              rotating machinery and aerospace applications.    This project in materials
              research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
              enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
              complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence.              ??
