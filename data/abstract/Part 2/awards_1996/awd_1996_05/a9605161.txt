Abstract    :
              ***  Wootters  This grant will provide research opportunities for ten 
              undergraduates for each of the next three summers (1997-  1999).  Half of these
              students will come from Williams and  half from other schools.  Each student
              will work at Williams  for ten weeks, as a member of a small research group 
              consisting of between two and four undergraduates and  advised by one faculty
              member.  The particular projects  offered are in the following areas: laser
              cooling, ultrafast  lasers, precision atomic measurements, fiber-optic lasers, 
              theory of open systems, and quantum information theory.  In  addition to their
              research projects, students will  participate in other activities including
              weekly seminars,  field trips to other research facilities, and social events.
