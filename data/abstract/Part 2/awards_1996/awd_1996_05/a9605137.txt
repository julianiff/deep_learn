Abstract    :
              ***  Lindgren  This grant will continue summer research program in  different
              areas of physics for twelve undergraduate students  with approximately
              one-third from U.Va. and two-thirds from  other non-Ph.D. granting
              institutions.  Projects cover a  broad range of experimental physics including
              nuclear and  high energy physics, atomic, molecular, condensed matter and 
              biological physics, materials and engineering physics  providing an opportunity
              for students with a wide range of  interest.  In particular, students will
              learn about using  electromagnetic probes to study quarks and nuclear behavior,
               momentum analysis with magnetic spectrometers, scintillation  detectors,
              calorimetry, Monte Carlo simulation,  chromatography, infrared difference
              spectroscopy, age  measures of globular clusters, magnetic susceptibilities of 
              superconductors using SQUIDS, identification of misfit  dislocations in
              semiconductors, analysis of Rydberg states  using photodetectors and
              overlapping laser and atom beams,  infrared surface spectroscopy, two photon
              photodetachment of  negative ions, and oxidation-introduction time analysis of 
              electric cable insulation.  Students will conduct research  over a nine week
              period in the summer and give periodic  written and oral progress reports in
              regular meetings with  their colleagues for self and group critique.  ***
