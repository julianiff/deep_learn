Abstract    :
                   A previously developed relativistic, separable  potential model of the
              pion-nucleon system will be extended  to higher energies and to a larger number
              of coupled  channels, including a photon-nucleon channel.  An exchange  model
              will be developed as an alternative to the separable  potential model.  These
              models will be used to calculate  meson-baryon scattering and production
              processes, properties  of the baryon resonances, and meson photoproduction from
               nucleons.       Previously developed one boson exchange models of the 
              two-nucleon system will be extended by including other  exchange processes, and
              by allowing for coupling to nucleon  delta and delta-delta states.  Inclusion
              of this coupling  will make it possible to account for inelastic processes. 
              Various schemes for calculating the electromagnetic form  factors of the
              deuteron will be investigated, with  particular attention paid to the
              restrictions imposed by  relativity and gauge invariance.       Calculations on
              the three-nucleon system will be  carried out using invariant three-nucleon
              mass operators  constructed from two-nucleon mass operators.  Such 
              calculations lead to results for the three-nucleon bound  states and scattering
              amplitudes which satisfy the  requirements of relativity, and therefore make it
              possible  to study relativistic effects in the three-nucleon system.
