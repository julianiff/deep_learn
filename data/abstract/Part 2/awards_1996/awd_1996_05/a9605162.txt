Abstract    :
              ***  Buck  This grant will support a residential summer program REU  Site at
              Hampton University.  The selection of students will  focus largely but not
              exclusively on those groups under-  represented in physics.  The research focus
              of the program  will be on nuclear and optical physics.  ***
