Abstract    :
              9605044    This award provides short term support for a collection of  over 500
              mutant zebrafish recently isolated by the grantee.  The funds will support
              distribution of mutants to other  researchers on request, and the preparation
              of frozen sperm of  each mutant strain that will be used to help found a
              permanent  collection at the University of Oregon sometime in the next  year. 
              Over the last few years, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has  emerged as a
              promising model system for genetic studies of  vertebrate development.  This
              small tropical fish has a  generation time of about 3 months and lays large
              numbers of  eggs.  The eggs are fertilized externally and develop into 
              transparent embryos.  For these reasons, the fish is amenable  to genetic
              analysis and experimental manipulation at a cost  significantly less than that
              of  the mouse, the only other  widely used model system for genetic studies of
              vertebrate  development.  Although the development of the requisite  techniques
              is relatively recent, a large and growing number of  investigators have begun
              to use the organism.
