Abstract    :
              9605206  Rothman-Denes  This project is for partial funding for the 1997 FASEB
              Summer Conference on "Transcription Initiation in Prokaryotes" to be held July
              19-24, 1997,  at the Vermont Academy in Saxtons River, Vermont, under the
              auspices of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology
              (FASEB).  There will be ten oral sessions with, on average, three 30 minute
              talks and two 15 minute talks per session, and two poster sessions, each
              lasting two days.  Thirty-two speakers have been invited and twelve additional
              speakers will be selected from participants who submitted abstracts.    The
              purpose of the meeting is to bring together biochemists, biophysicists and
              geneticists to share information on a crucial step that regulates the flow of
              information in all cells: transcription initiation.  The rapidly progressing
              field is providing information on structure and mechanisms at the molecular
              level.    The specific topics to be discussed in the oral sessions are
              structure of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, physical and chemical approaches to
              study protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions in transcription, promoter
              recognition, transcription initiation in archae and thermophilic bacteria,
              biochemistry of transcription initiation and promoter escape, mechanisms of
              negative and positive control, and control of transcription in complex systems.
