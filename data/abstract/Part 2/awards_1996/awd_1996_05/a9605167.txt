Abstract    :
              9605167  Schneider    The Neural Basis of Cognition Undergraduate Research
              Summer Program will annually train ten undergraduate students in an intensive
              ten-week interdisciplinary study of cognitive neuroscience.  The instruction
              and research effort will train students to interpret human cognitive behavior
              in the language of modern neuroscience.  Through lectures and laboratory
              activity, students will be exposed to the methods and results of multiple
              disciplines, including neurophysiology, neuroanatomy, neuroimaging,
              neuropsychology, biophysics, mathematics, and computational neuroscience.  The
              program takes advantage of the major joint initiatives of the University of
              Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University in cognitive neuroscience, including
              the established research-training program in Neural Processes in Cognition and
              the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, as well as the basic-research
              facilities of the University of Pittsburgh Medical School.  The program
              involves academic lectures and lab tours in the related scientific disciplines,
              lectures on career development and ethics, research reading groups, extensive
              laboratory-research experience, and social scientific interactions.  The
              program encourages college students to pursue graduate training and scientific
              careers in the emerging area of cognitive and computational neuroscience.  This
              unique program also provides a national example of interdisciplinary training
              for cognitive neuroscience.
