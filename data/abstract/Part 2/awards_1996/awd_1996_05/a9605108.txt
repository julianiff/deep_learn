Abstract    :
              ***  Graf  The Stony Brook Research Experiences for Undergraduates in  Physics
              program brings 13 undergraduate students to the  Stony Brook campus each summer
              for participation in  forefront research in the laboratories of Stony Brook 
              physics faculty members.  The aim of the program is to  foster interest in, and
              appreciation of, scientific research  in physics and to facilitate career
              planning, by the actual  doing of research in a collegial setting, by site
              visits to  research laboratories at Stony Brook and Brookhaven National 
              Laboratory, by weekly seminars on current problems in  physics and finally by
              student presentations of research  results in a formal symposium at the
              conclusion of the  program.  Outstanding projects will be presented at the 
              national student symposia.  The program offers research opportunities in the
              areas of  nuclear physics, particle physics, lasers and optics, solid-  state
              physics and atmospheric physics.  Most projects are  experimental, but a few
              are theoretical.  Recruiting efforts concentrate on sophomore and junior level 
              physics majors of high academic standing, many from colleges  in which research
              opportunities are limited.  Particular  efforts are made to attract women and
              students from under-  represented minorities.  ***
