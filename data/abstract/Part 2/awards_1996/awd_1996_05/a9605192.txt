Abstract    :
                   New theoretical ideas and advancements in computer  technology have created
              a Renaissance in microscopic nuclear  structure theory.  More and more
              nuclear-theory groups are  turning to the problem of how to calculate the
              structure of  finite nuclei microscopically, mainly in terms of extremely 
              large model spaces.  Our research group was one of the first  to become
              involved in this renewed interest in microscopic  nuclear-structure
              calculations, our approach being one of  constructing the best possible
              interaction to employ in the  chosen model space.  This has led us to work in a
              large  model space, in which all the nuclear particles (i.e.,  nucleons) are
              active.  So far this approach has been  extremely successful in describing
              microscopically the  properties of nuclei with two to ten nucleons.  We plan to
               extend this approach to nuclei with up to 16 nucleons or  even larger. 
              Extremely large nuclei with more than 100  nucleons, which cannot be
              investigated by the above  approach, will be studied using a model in terms of
              pairs of  nucleons, instead of individual nucleons.
