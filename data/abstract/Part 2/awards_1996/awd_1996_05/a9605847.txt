Abstract    :
              This project involves the ethnographic field research of two senior and one
              junior cultural anthropologists from the University of Georgia.  The project
              proposed to document the complete inventory of edible resources of the Highland
              Maya of Chiapas, Mexico, and to analyze the contribution of these resources to
              the Maya diet.  It is well known that rural peoples exploit food sources that
              are not well recognized by non-locals, yet which can be important supplements
              in a dietary sense.  Using standard methods of ethnographic interviews, formal
              data elicitation techniques, dietary recall and garden surveys, the use of
              local experts to collect food resources and document them, as well as formal
              interviews of a sample of 50 men and 50 women in each of two Mayan townships,
              the available food resources will be described and analyzed for their impact on
              the diet.   This research is important because population pressure and
              deteriorating economic conditions have impacted negatively on rural diets in
              many areas of the world.  This project will attempt to describe the complete
              range of local resources available in diets, and will stimulate new research
              into viable alternative diets which can help improve the long-term well being
              of this and comparable rural populations.  In addition, the demonstration that
              little known edible resources are important food sources can advance our
              understanding of their place in the ecosystem and encourage their conservation
              and sustainable use.
