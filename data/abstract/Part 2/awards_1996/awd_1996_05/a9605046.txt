Abstract    :
              9605046  Reddy    This award provides support for a joint workshop on high 
              performance concrete including marine structures organized  by Professor D.V.
              Reddy of Florida Atlantic University and  Dr. B.V. Rangan of the Curtin
              University of Technology,  Perth, Australia.  The primary focus of the workshop
              will be  to highlight recent advances in the United States and  Australia on
              the use of new supplementary cementing  materials such as fly ash, silica fume,
              slag, and natural  pozzolans, and fibers to increase the durability of 
              concrete.  The factors considered will be 1) materials and  design, 2) loading,
              3) structural details, 4) environmental  considerations, and 5) constructional
              techniques.  The U.S.  team will include four junior investigators and six
              senior  researchers.  The workshop will be timed to coincide with  the
              International Conference on the Durability of Concrete  in  Sydney.  This will
              allow the American team to interact  with leading researchers from the East
              Asian region as well  as from around the world.
