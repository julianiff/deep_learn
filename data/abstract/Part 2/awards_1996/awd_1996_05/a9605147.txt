Abstract    :
              ***  Becker  San Jose State University, a campus of the California State 
              University, is a modern urban comprehensive university in  which faculty are
              required to do research. There is a large  18-faculty Department of Physics
              with approximately 35  undergraduate Physics majors in their Junior and Senior 
              years, including approximately fifteen students who are  female or members of
              under-represented minorities.  The REU Site that has been in operation since
              1989 in the  SJSU Physics Department will be continued.  An innovative 
              component of this REU Site includes support for students in 
              industry-university collaborations: Four teams consist of a  Physics faculty
              member, a physicist from an industry or  government laboratory, and an NSF-REU
              student participant.  Most of the projects are in the areas of optics,
              condensed  matter, and computational physics.  All these projects  complement
              the Physics Department's officially recognized  "Concentration in Lasers and
              Optics", "Concentration in  Condensed Matter", and the "Concentration in
              Computational  Physics".  These three areas represent the major scientific 
              focus in the hightech "Silicon Valley" surrounding this  University.  These
              on-going research projects will provide  both experimental and theoretical
              research experience for  undergraduates in physics.  Undergraduate students are
              placed in fourteen projects which  range from experimental diode laser
              spectroscopy of stable  isotopes in carbon dioxide to theoretical studios of 
              electrical and optical properties of quantum well  semiconductors, to
              rare-earth spectroscopy.  The proposed program's major goal is to involve 
              undergraduate students, especially minorities, in research  who might not
              otherwise have the opportunity. ***
