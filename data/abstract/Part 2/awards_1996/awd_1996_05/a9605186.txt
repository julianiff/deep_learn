Abstract    :
                   New experiments at Brookhaven and CERN will probe  matter at high
              temperatures and densities, achieved only  during the very early stages of
              evolution of the Universe.  The next generation of Astrophysical experiments
              will also  offer a glimpse of the Physics of the Early Universe through  the
              imprint left by the physical processes as anisotropies  in the Cosmic Microwave
              Background.  Particle Physics  predicts that several phase transitions have
              occurred during  the very Early Universe that are responsible for these 
              anisotropies.  My project is to develop and implement the  tools of
              non-equilibrium quantum physics to provide a  detailed analysis of the dynamics
              of these phase  transitions.  The goal is to be able to recognize and  quantify
              their Cosmological consequences and their  experimental signatures and to
              compare predictions from  theories to the experimental data that will become
              available  through these new experiments.  It has been recognized that  only a
              consistent study away from equilibrium can address  effectively the Physics of
              the extreme environments that has  taken place in the Early Universe.
