Abstract    :
              9605069  Parker   Description:  This award is for the "U.S.-India  Cooperative
              Research: Interaction of Toxic  Metals with an Abundant Natural Material, 
              Capsular Polysaccharide from Indian  Cyanobacteria".  The project is directed
              by  Dorothy Parker, University of Wisconsin and  L.C. Rai, Banaras Hindu
              University.  This  project will examine the accumulation of toxic  metals by
              cyanobacteria and cyanobacterial  polysaccharides from Indian waters.  In 
              addition to having unique metal content, many  Indian ponds are a 
              biologically-reliable and  environmentally-constant source of the  
              cyanobacterium Microcystis which adsorbs  specific metal ions.  The research
              will  contribute to fundamental knowledge on:  cyanobacterial polysaccharides
              with affinities  for toxic or valuable metals; the role of these 
              polysaccharides in the cycling or accumulation  of metals in aquatic
              ecosystems; the range of  extracellular polysaccharides produced by 
              cyanobacteria from two continents; and the  utility of these polysaccharides in
              metal-  related biotechnology.         Scope:  This collaboration was initiated
              by an  INT supported planning visit for Dr. Parker,  plus a sabbatical visit to
              Baneras Hindu  University.  The collaboration which links two  university
              research laboratories expands the  capabilities of both groups and  makes it 
              possible to examine novel questions that  pertain to environmental concerns and
               biotechnical applications affecting India and  the U.S.         ***
