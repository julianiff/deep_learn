Abstract    :
              9605122  Stahly    A proven undergraduate summer research program that has been
              in operation for several years will be continued and expanded.  During the
              summers of 1997 through 1999, respectively, 9, 10, and 10 undergraduates will
              be supported.  As in the past years, recruitment and selection will emphasize
              women, minorities, and students from non-Ph.D.-granting institutions, where
              opportunities for research are limited.  The students selected will be
              integrated into the research of participating faculty members and will be
              expected to perform like beginning graduate students.  The hands-on experience
              in the laboratory will be supplemented by informal faculty-student discussions
              and weekly seminars.  The program will culminate with oral and written
              presentations of the students' research.  Weekly pizza lunches, two picnics,
              and a banquet will facilitate social and scientific interaction.  Based on past
              experience, the program is expected to stimulate students to pursue careers in
              science.
