Abstract    :
              ***  Newman  A physics research program for ten undergraduate students  will be
              continued at UC Irvine each summer for the next  three years.  The program
              involves projects with a variety  of physics research groups under close
              supervision by  faculty and senior research staff.  Research opportunities  are
              offered in the areas of experimental elementary particle  physics, condensed
              matter, plasma physics, and astrophysics.  Close contact between student
              participants, encouraging the  sharing of research experiences in these varied
              areas is  promoted by providing shared housing, and through social  activities.
               The research experience is further enhanced  through a seminar series, visits
              to the labs of fellow  participants, and excursions to other research labs in
              the  Los Angeles area.  ***
