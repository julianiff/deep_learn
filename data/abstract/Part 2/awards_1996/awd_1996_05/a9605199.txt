Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical elementary particle physics  will include numerical
              studies of Quantum Chromodynamics  (QCD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and
              Quantum Gravity.  Quantum Chromodynamics is the theory of the strong nuclear 
              force, Quantum Electrodynamics is the theory of the  electromagnetic force and
              Quantum Gravity seeks to explain  the gravitational force.  The present project
              will develop a  practical simulation method for massless quarks in QCD, an 
              algorithm to simulate QCD in environments rich in protons  and neutrons, and
              will determine whether several  conventional field theories, including QED, are
              consistent.  Massless quarks and the generation of dynamical masses are 
              essential ingredients in understanding the properties of  nuclei.  The physics
              of environments rich in protons and  neutrons underlies nuclear physics and
              should explain the  properties of dense stars.  The consistency, or lack 
              thereof, of field theories used to build models of strong,  weak,
              electromagnetic and gravitational interactions will  determine the directions
              of elementary particle physics in  the near future.
