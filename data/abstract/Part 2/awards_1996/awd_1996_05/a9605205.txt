Abstract    :
              INT 9605205  Pollock    John A. Pollock:  "Planning Visit: Analysis of Normal
              and  Genetically Mutant Visual system Development using Multi  Dimensional Time
              Lapse Microscopy"    This award supports a planning visit of Dr. John A.
              Pollock  of the Department of Biological Sciences, Carnegie Mellon  University
              to Dr. Philip Batterham of the Department of  Genetics, University of
              Melbourne, Australia.  They will  establish a collaboration focused on the
              molecular genetics  and developmental neurobiology of the developing visual 
              system in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This  international project
              is an interdisciplinary study that  capitalizes on particular strengths of the
              two counterparts  whose research utilizes genetics, molecular biology, 
              microscopic imaging and computer science.  The two week  planning visit will
              permit the U.S. counterpart to consult  with the Australian partner, as needed
              to create the  specific  experimental design and time table for the 
              internationalization of the project.  Partner exchange both  from the United
              States and to the United States will broaden  the impact of the NSF supported
              biological research ongoing  in the Center for Light Microscope Imaging and
              Biotechnology  at Carnegie Mellon  University in Pittsburgh.
