Abstract    :
              9605098  Berkowitz   New York's Institute of Ecosystem Studies (IES) hosts a
              summer-research program for undergraduate students, with support from the NSF
              REU-Sites program.  Building upon a distinguished record of training and
              research, emphasizing forest ecosystem structure and function, the Institute's
              program immerses students in a highly interactive, 12-week session of
              field-based projects, seminars, workshops, and presentations.  Anticipated
              outcomes include: (1) students acquire a broad perspective in modern
              field-based ecology and in science more generally; (2) students learn
              fundamental skills in designing, executing, and completing a research project;
              and (3) students become better prepared to choose and pursue a career in
              science.  Minority-student participation as well as participation by women have
              been significant in past NSF-supported programs, and efforts are being made to
              continue those emphases.   The program has four components:  (1) Student
              research projects--working closely with a mentor scientist, each student
              develops a research question and associated hypotheses, implements the project,
              collects and analyzes data, gives an oral presentation in a formal Research
              Symposium, and writes a paper.  (2) Research strategies for
              undergraduates--workshops provide training in various tools and techniques
              essential for modern ecological research.  (3) Research in context--the staff
              of IES along with visiting scientists offer seminars and case studies to
              broaden students' perspectives on scientific work.  (4) Forum on opportunities
              in ecology--a full-day forum exposes students to a broad range of career
              choices in basic and applied ecology.
