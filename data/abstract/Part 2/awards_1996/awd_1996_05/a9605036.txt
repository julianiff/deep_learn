Abstract    :
              This international collaboration between the PI and Reint de Boer of the
              University of   Essen will simultaneously apply two complementary approaches to
              investigate a variety of   important issues in the study of porous media.  It
              will examine issues of effective stress   principle, uplift, friction, and
              capillarity in compressible porous solids phase saturated with   a compressible
              and an incompressible liquid, and a three-phase system.  The Essen group   uses
              a continuum thermomechanical macroscopic methodology to derive the balance  
              equations and the associated constitutive expressions.  The PI's group uses a  
              micromechanical approach, based on a new application of the principles of
              classical   ensemble averaging to porous media.  An agreement between the
              results obtained by these   two methods will be a substantial contribution to
              porous media theory in providing a   computational algorithm to estimate many
              of the phenomenological constants in the   macroscopic theory.  The
              international collaboration will thus lead to improved modeling   of saturated
              porous media, relevant to many disciplines such as soil mechanics,  
              geophysics, civil and petroleum engineering, biomechanics, and materials
              processing.
