Abstract    :
              9605130  Bisson    This award to Professor Mary Bisson of the Department of 
              Biological Sciences of the State University of  New York at  Buffalo will allow
              her to travel to Australia's Great  Barrier Reef  where, with her counterpart,
              Dr. Mary Beilby  of the Department of Biophysics of the University of New 
              South Wales, she will collect specimens of  the alga Valonia  ventricosa for
              placement as cultures in both New South Wales  and at her home institution in
              Buffalo.  This will provide  the basic materials for her research into membrane
               transport, particularly fluxes in the ion transport systems.
