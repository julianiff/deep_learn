Abstract    :
              9605091  Whitfield    This project will support travel to Australia by Professor
               James Whitfield, Department of Entomology, University of  Arkansas, and his
              Post Doctoral Research Assistant, Dr.  Patrick Mardulyn, to work with Dr.
              Andrew Austin of the  Department of Crop Protection, Waite Institute,
              University  of Adelaide.  During their visits they will coordinate  research
              and analyze morphological and DNA sequence data for  a phylogenetic study of a
              group of parasitoid wasps.  The  results will be useful in studies of evolution
              of parasitism  in the wasps and in ongoing research on the co-phylogeny of 
              polydnaviruses and parasitoid wasps.  The new classification  will be
              invaluable to a large community of biologists  interested in
              naturally-occurring and human-manipulated  management of pest insects and to an
              additional community of  scientists engaged in biodiversity surveys.
