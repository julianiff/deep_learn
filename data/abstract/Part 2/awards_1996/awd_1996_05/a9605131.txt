Abstract    :
              9605131  Henry    The Physics Department at the University of Arkansas in 
              Fayetteville proposes to establish a Research Experience for  Undergraduates
              (REU) site in modern optics and optical materials.  The REU site will build on
              an existing undergraduate program in  Modern Optics for science and engineering
              majors. The program has  targeted Historically Black Colleges and Universities
              in the  region for student recruitment. Student participants will spend  ten
              weeks in the summer working on research topics that include  semiconductor
              waveguides, diode lasers, and photorefractive  crystals.  %%%  The program will
              provide undergraduate students from the region  with a research experience that
              will encourage them to pursue  further education and training in modern optics,
              and eventually  provide better trained students in this technologically
              important  area.  ***
