Abstract    :
              ***  Desrosiers  SURFing the Physics Lab is a NIST-NSF partnership to  encourage
              outstanding physics students by providing research  opportunities with the
              world-class atomic, molecular,  optical and radiation physicists in the NIST
              Physics  Laboratory.  To strengthen undergraduate AMO physics  curricula, the
              program director will work with department  chairs and directors of centers of
              excellence to identify  two or three undergraduates from each institution who
              are  prepared for, and would benefit from, off-campus summer  research in AMO
              physics.  The selected students will spend  12 weeks engaged one-on-one with
              NIST physicists in projects  combining quests for fundamental knowledge with
              direct  applications to problems of national importance.  Student  and advisor
              will be paired based on background and  interests.  The students will live in a
              nearby furnished  apartment complex and participate in the many NIST seminars 
              and in a weekly SURFing the Physics Lab summer seminar  series.  The students
              will present their research in a  seminar at NIST and be encouraged to
              participate in a  scientific conference during the following year.  NIST, NSF 
              and the participating schools will share the costs for this  program.  Given
              the significant lack of diversity in the  present physics work force, this
              program will actively seek  out competitive students from under-represented
              groups.  ***
