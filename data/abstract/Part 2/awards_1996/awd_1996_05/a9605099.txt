Abstract    :
              9605099  Valiela    Tile: Research experience for undergraduates in coastal bays
              of New  England    The Boston University Marine Program operates an REU site
              for 10  undergraduate students each year to conduct research during the  summer
              in behavior, ecology, biogeochemistry, hydrogeology, and  management of
              organisms and ecosystems within the coastal bays of  New England. The students
              are recruited nationally, with a special  emphasis on attracting under
              represented minorities. The students  are involved in designing and conducting
              research projects, writing  and submitting a refereed paper, and making an oral
              presentation of  the results.
