Abstract    :
              9605037  Ramaswamy  Description:  This award supports the "U.S.-  India
              Cooperative Research: Investigations of  Atmospheric Chemistry-Aerosols-Climate
               Interactions".  The collaborators are V.  Ramaswamy, NOAA/Geophysical Fluid
              Dynamics  Laboratory (GFDL), Princeton, New Jersey and  P.C.S. Devara, Indian
              Institute of Tropical  Meteorology (IITM), Pune, India.  The PIs will  study
              aerosols and the effects of radiative  forcing on the weather and climate
              systems.   Using a unique long-term data set collected at  IITM, the PIs will
              employ sophisticated  radiative transfer modeling tools available at  the GFDL
              to determine the radiative effects of  aerosols,typical of Indian
              subcontinental urban  locations.  This research will improve current  estimates
              of radiative forcing which are  inadequate due to limited knowledge of 
              physical-chemical variability in atmospheric  composition at tropical urban
              sites.      Scope:  This award provides initial support for  a new U.S.-India  
              research collaboration on  the environment and global change.  The field  of
              investigation is critical for the South Asia  region.  This project promises to
              stimulate  further international collaborative research in  a strategically
              important area.  The project is  supported by NOAA/GFDL and the Division of  
              International Programs.     ***
