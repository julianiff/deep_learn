Abstract    :
              9605155  Burris    This summer program is designed to take advantage of the rich
              diversity of research and of educational opportunities at the Marine Biological
              Laboratory (MBL) in the use of marine organisms in the areas of cell and
              developmental biology, and neurobiology.  Undergraduate students will be chosen
              from applicants recruited from throughout the country.  They will be selected
              on the basis of their academic credentials and their potential to benefit from
              an intensive research experience.  Each student will be directed in an
              independent research project by a faculty mentor who is an investigator at the
              MBL.  Students will also attend selected lectures and seminars, group
              discussions directed by faculty mentors, and the program's own seminar series
              in which selected MBL researchers discuss the value of different marine models
              in specific areas of biological investigation.  Students will have the
              opportunity to interact with leading scientists from throughout the world, to
              be introduced to the latest research technologies, and to experience first-hand
              the intensity, enthusiasm, and excitement for which the MBL summer experience
              is well known.
