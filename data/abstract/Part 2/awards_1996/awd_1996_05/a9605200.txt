Abstract    :
                                              9605200  Borowsky                               
                                                This is a 36-month award proposed by Dr.
              Richard Borowsky,  New York University collaborating with Professor Visut 
              Baimai of Mahidol University in Thailand.  Dr. Borowsky requests funds for
              student support and for  travel and field costs in Thailand to carry out a
              project to  assess the genetic diversity of five cave fishes of the  genera
              Noemacheilus, Homaloptera, and Barbus, and their  relationships to other close
              relatives of these fishes in  Thailand.  The results from this study can
              provide an answer  to the question of the origin of cave fishes, their 
              adaptations to cave life and, in particular their loss of  vision (regression
              evolution).    This study addresses a  very important fundamental question in
              the origin of genetic  diversity in cave fishes and will contribute to
              Thailand's  biodiversity research efforts.  The Biodiversity Research  and
              Training Program of  the Thailand  National Science and  Technology Development
              Agency will provide matching support  for the Thai students to allow them to
              participate in this  project.   This project addresses two major focus areas: a
               unique site in a remote area with little or no data, and  supporting the
              participation of a U. S. graduate student in  international cooperative studies
              in developing countries  and the training of Thai students.
