Abstract    :
              All life on this planet is ultimately dependent on  photosynthesis for its
              energy requirements.  At Arizona  State University the Center for the Study of
              Early Events in  Photosynthesis, comprised of faculty in the departments of 
              Botany, Chemistry and Biochemistry, takes an  interdisciplinary approach to
              understanding the energy  storage process carried out by photosynthetic
              organisms and  mimicking photosynthesis using artificial systems. 
              Undergraduate students will participate in the individual  research programs of
              the center faculty.  Projects will  include organic synthesis and spectroscopic
              studies of model  compounds, spectroscopic studies of bacterial and plant 
              photosynthetic reaction centers, and molecular biology and  genetics of
              photosynthetic systems.  Structured interaction  between faculty and student
              participants, including the  weekly photosynthesis seminar series, research
              group  meetings, instrumentation workshops and a concluding  undergraduate
              symposium, will help educate the students in  the extremely diverse modern
              approach to the study of  photosynthesis.  Student participants will be
              recruited from  targeted colleges and universities in the Southwest United 
              States with the help of local department chairs and  individual faculty.
