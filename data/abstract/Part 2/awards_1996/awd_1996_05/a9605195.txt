Abstract    :
              This project will study the electronic spectra of known and  postulated carbon
              chains and rings using a combination of  spectroscopic techniques, including
              Fourier transform  microwave spectroscopy, laser-induced fluorescence, 
              resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization, and cavity  ringdown spectroscopy. 
              The purpose of the research is to  conduct experiments in the laboratory that
              will provide a  crucial test to the theory that long carbon chains and other 
              large molecules are the carriers of the diffuse interstellar  bands.  At the
              same time the results could provide insight  into the fundmentals of carbon
              chemistry, in particular, the  formation of C60 and other fullerenes from
              simple  precursors.  Exemplifying the strong interdisciplinary  nature of this
              work, this project is co-sponsored by the  Divisions of Physics, Chemistry, and
              Astronomy and the  Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the MPS 
              Directorate.
