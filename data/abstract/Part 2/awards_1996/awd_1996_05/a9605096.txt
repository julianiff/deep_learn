Abstract    :
              ***  Campbell  This grant will continue support for the NSF-sponsored  "Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates" (REU) site in the  Department of Physics at the
              University of Illinois, Urbana-  Champaign (UIUC).  Based on the previous REU
              program in  nonlinear science, the breadth and strength of the physics 
              research efforts in this department, and the specific  requests of present REU
              applicants, an expanded variety of  related projects selected from condensed
              matter physics,  biophysics, astrophysics, and nuclear and particle physics 
              will be added to the core component of nonlinear science.  The target group
              includes students who have completed at  least four semesters (equivalent) of
              undergraduate training  in the physical or computational sciences or
              mathematics.  ***
