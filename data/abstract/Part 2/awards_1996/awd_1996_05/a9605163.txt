Abstract    :
              Rhee  9605163    This award supports a three-year collaborative research 
              project between Dr. G-Yull Rhee of the New York State  Department of Health and
              Dr. Jin-Hwan Lee of Sangmyung  University in Seoul, Korea on "Production of
              Dissolved  Organic Carbon and Taste-and-Odor Compounds Through  Extracellular
              Excretion and Cell Death in Cyanobacteria."  The goals of the project are: 1)
              to determine the effect of  light intensity on the production of dissolved
              organic  carbon and major odor producing compounds, and the relative 
              importance of excretion and cell death in their production,  2) to elucidate
              the seasonal dynamics of the compounds in a  reservoir, and 3) to identify
              problem species which produce  off-flavor compounds.    The production and
              consumption of dissolved organic carbon  in the aquatic ecosystem has important
              implications for  primary productivity, heterotrophic microbial production and 
              nutrient cycling.  From a public health standpoint, high  concentrations of
              dissolved organic carbon and taste and  odor producing compounds can impair
              potability and  recreational use of water.  This study will help elucidate  the
              release of these compounds from cyanobacteria, a  prevalent group of
              phytoplankton often associated with  eutrophication.   The expertise and
              facilities of the U.S.  and Korean research groups will be combined in an
              effort to  significantly advance the work.  ***
