Abstract    :
              9605196  Kuzirian  This award will enable U.S. scientists to participate in the
              International Marine Biotechnology Conference (IMBC'97), which is to be held in
              southern Italy from Sept. 22 through Sept. 29, 1997.  The specific objectives
              of IMBC'97 follow:            a.  Present the latest discoveries and
              applications of marine science with an    emphasis on biotechnology.   b. 
              Familiarize industrial and academic scientists and biotechnology policymakers
              with advances in all aspects of marine biotechnology.  c.  Bring together
              colleagues from all over the world so that the latest science can be critically
              evaluated.   d.   Facilitate the development of joint ventures and research
              partnerships by providing opportunities for making contacts through scientific
              discussions and informal social gatherings.   e.  Assemble a volume of extended
              abstracts so that the science presented at                                     
                  this conference will be readily available.   f.  Provide material that will
              lead to creative new ideas and applications for products and profits.    This
              innovative conference has been designed to develop a multidisciplinary, highly
              interactive program.  The topics chosen for the conference reflect the great
              interest among scientists in exploring the nature of biological interactions
              between organisms living in the diverse and often extreme habitats of the
              marine world. Basic research on biological mechanisms and molecular
              interactions related to a life in aquatic systems continues to yield valuable
              information about fundamental biological principles. Such studies on the
              processes and products of marine organisms have led to new and sometimes
              unexpected applications in many fields - including medicine, production of
              marine food and chemicals, and sequestration of mineral resources. The emerging
              science of marine biotechnology is being applied to the management of marine
              biological resources and to the monitoring and cleaning up of the marine
              environment.
