Abstract    :
              9605003  Stednick    This Americas Program award will support a workshop on
              karst  hydrology and water quality issues in the Caribbean, to take  place in
              Jamaica. Organizers are Dr. John Stednick, Colorado  State University, and
              Michael White, Hydrological  Consultants, Inc., Kingston Jamaica. The workshop
              will form  part of an international symposium on hydrology in the humid 
              tropical environment.  The workshop will provide a forum for  exchange of
              experiences and theories related to hydrologic  and environmental impacts,
              conflicts, and solutions, when  related to the uniqueness of the humid tropics.
               Because  population growth in the developing countries of the region  is
              subjecting karst aquifers to environmental stress, the  theme is important and
              timely.    The meeting will compare and contrast approaches to research 
              problems, analyze hydrologic data, water and land-use  practices, and discuss
              and evaluate the consequences of  these activities on the sustainability of
              water resources.  ***
