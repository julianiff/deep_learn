Abstract    :
               This project improves and expands an undergraduate digital laboratory to teach
              digital cartography, geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, and
              global positioning systems (GPS) in the Department of Geography and Earth
              Science. These fields represent the latest developments in present day mapping
              sciences. Because of the rapid conversion of traditional cartographic and
              mapping methods into the world of high technology, applications that
              revolutionize all mapping sciences, GPS, GIS, and digital approaches to remote
              sensing need to be included and expanded in the curriculum. Three new courses
              in the mapping sciences have been developed which will be greatly enhanced by
              the equipment purchased in this project. The instrumentation and laboratory
              funds to equip a laboratory provide undergraduate students with hands-on
              computer experience in the mapping sciences while supporting both theoretical
              and practical pedagogic values. These experiences can have a profound and
              lasting effect on students' understanding of science and their motivation to
              pursue further study.
