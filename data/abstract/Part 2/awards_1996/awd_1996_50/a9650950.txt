Abstract    :
              This project will develop a laboratory program in environmental health and
              environmental chemistry using an electron capture detector, a capillary
              conversion kit to convert a Hewlett-Packard Model 5880A (HP-5880A) gas
              chromatograph equipped with dual flame ionization detector, and ancillary data
              acquisition board and  chromatographic software.  This equipment  will greatly
              expand the scope of the laboratory experiences available to undergraduate
              environmental health science and chemistry students, and will enable the
              university to better assist high school science teachers. A number of
              laboratory courses will be modified in order to make use of the requested
              enhancements to the HP-5880A: Practicum in Environmental Health, Environmental
              Measurement, Introduction to Research Techniques in Chemistry, Instrumental
              Methods of Analysis, Introduction to Research in Chemistry. This resource will
              be made available to colleagues and students from other graduate programs at
              Indiana State University (ISU). In addition, we will prepare a laboratory
              manual that will be used at ISU and made available to others upon request. In
              addition, selected high school students and their teachers will be given an
              opportunity to gain hands-on experience with the analysis of environmental
              samples.
