Abstract    :
               This project is expanding the education of undergraduate chemists, biochemists
              (BCMs), and nonmajors, starting with biochemistry/physical chemistry
              implementation. It enhances student independence and teamwork in advanced labs
              and capstone research courses. Outcomes include department seminars and
              presentations at scientific meetings. A very solid life science connection is
              shown by near-doubled numbers of majors since the 1991 beginning of the BCM
              program. The department hopes to pass students through a curriculum rich in
              blended physical, biological, and organic chemistry techniques. This approach
              stimulates student interest; interrelates the biological, physical, and organic
              components; gives students largely unavailable expertise in relevant modern
              chemistry techniques; and enlarges their desirability as higher education and
              employment candidates. The first use of the DNA sequencer, scanning
              calorimeter, and protein electrophoresis units will be biochemistry- and
              medicinal-chemistry-based DNA exploration; reinforcement of the thermodynamic
              and kinetic concepts related to polymers; and the study and purification of
              enzymes. Each planned study aspect is set into broad, integrated lab
              experiments. The project also trains undergraduates in related research
              methods. Other chemistry faculty can also use the equipment in their courses
              and training agendas. So, the program helps to enhance science infrastructure
              quality.
