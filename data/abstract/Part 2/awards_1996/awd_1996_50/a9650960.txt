Abstract    :
               Expectations set forth by the mathematics professionals in the AMATYC
              standards, and by business and industry leaders in the SCANS Report, recommend
              that students entering the workforce be prepared to (1) gather, display, and
              analyze real-world data and then communicate their findings; (2) understand how
              to integrate concepts in math with science or engineering or liberal arts
              through data gathering and problem-solving experiences; and (3) be able to use
              new technologies and recognize them as valuable instructional tools.   This
              project uses TI-92 calculators in conjunction with the Calculator-Based
              Laboratories (CBLs) for its three comprehensive instructional sites in order to
              address workforce expectations and help students become active learners in
              mathematics. With this equipment, students can engage in class or small group
              projects that solve realistic problems.   CAS software has not been available
              for classroom use in precalculus or calculus, science, or engineering
              technology courses. Faculty who have used graphing calculators can attend a CAS
              Short Course. Faculty, upon return, can train their colleagues in developing
              classroom activities using the TI-92 in combination with the CBL in mathematics
              and science classes.   The faculty training and development of classroom
              activities can be shared via a World Wide Web site on the Internet and at state
              and national professional meetings.
