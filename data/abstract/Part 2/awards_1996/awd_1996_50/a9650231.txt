Abstract    :
               Introductory astronomy students frequently have difficulty connecting the
              theoretical knowledge presented in lectures with astronomical observations.
              Another difficulty is in making the connection between the `Copernican` view of
              astronomy, dominant in lecture courses, with the `Ptolemaic` view of the sky
              manifest to the Earth-bound observer. This course combines interactive
              planetarium simulations with telescopic observation in order to bridge these
              gaps in understanding. With modern technology, planetarium simulations are
              devised in which students mark significant events in the sky with light pens
              and trace out important sky motions. These movements are measured against
              simulation time which is provided by computer to each student group. The
              astronomical observations emphasize simplicity and complement the planetarium
              simulations. The primary objective is to provide students the means to connect
              a thorough observing experience with the wealth of astronomical knowledge
              presented in the companion lecture course. The techniques and instrumentation
              developed are readily transferable to other institutions.
