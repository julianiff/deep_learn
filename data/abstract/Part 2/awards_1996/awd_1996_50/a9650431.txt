Abstract    :
               This project involves the use of new laboratory experiments that verify basic
              properties of quantum mechanical systems, including the interference of quantum
              states and the existence of conjugate variables, for the sophomore-through
              senior-year undergraduate physics curriculum. Students are employing ultrafast
              measurement techniques, including time-dependent spectroscopy and laser pulse
              auto-correlation.  These techniques involve the use of an ultrashort-pulse
              laser oscillator capable of producing pulses of 20x10-15 second duration at a
              repetition rate of 108 Hz. This experimental equipment is based on solid state
              optical components and is easily maintained.
