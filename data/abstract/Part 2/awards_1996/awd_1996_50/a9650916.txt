Abstract    :
               This project develops a high vacuum systems laboratory for a 2-year, associate
              of applied science degree program in Microelectronics Technology. This unique,
              advanced-level technical program prepares technicians for jobs in the wafer fab
              in our nation's expanding semiconductor industry. Wafer fab technicians need a
              working knowledge of high vacuum systems because high vacuum techniques are so
              pervasive in the manufacture of integrated circuits. Unfortunately, few
              colleges are prepared to offer high vacuum systems courses because of a lack of
              suitable training systems and a lack of appropriate instructional materials. To
              address this need, this project is purchasing six miniturbomolecular (high
              vacuum) pumping stations and three helium leak detectors to equip a
              technician-level, high vacuum systems laboratory, adapt them for educational
              use, and design laboratory experiments for these systems. Experiments can be
              compiled and published as a laboratory manual for use at other community
              colleges and technical institutes. Laboratory experiments include
              demonstrations of vacuum fundamentals, operation of the pumping station,
              gauging and pressure measurement techniques, and leak detection.
