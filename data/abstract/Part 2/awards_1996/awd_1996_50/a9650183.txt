Abstract    :
               The primary goal of the Chemistry Department is to provide a high-quality
              education for undergraduate students. The laboratory experience is a vital part
              of the chemistry curriculum. The incorporation of a state-of-the-art gas
              chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) instrument into the laboratory program
              permits the department to develop new experiments that increase the
              attractiveness of the chemistry program and greatly enhance the laboratory
              experience for both chemistry majors and nonmajors. A new Environmental
              Chemical Analysis course is using the GC/MS in the examination of three sets of
              real-world samples and employing EPA reference procedures. The GC/MS is also
              being used in Quantitative Organic Analysis and Instrumental Analysis courses.
              Students also use this instrument for research projects that enable them to
              investigate, characterize, and identify compounds of interest.   In summary,
              the goal of this project is to strengthen the undergraduate curriculum by
              introducing students to state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation and
              encouraging the pursuit of further scientific studies with GC/MS.
