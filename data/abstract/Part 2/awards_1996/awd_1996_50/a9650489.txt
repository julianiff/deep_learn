Abstract    :
              An experiment designed to connect quantum mechanical textbook examples and
              concepts in optics with technologically important materials is being undertaken
              in the upper-level undergraduate student laboratories. Using a versatile
              spectrometer system and an efficient detector, students are performing
              photoluminescence (optical emission), optical reflectivity, and Raman
              (inelastic scattering of light) measurements on novel materials.    Samples
              chosen for this laboratory experiment are semiconductor quantum well
              heterostructures (QWH), which are used in lasers and modern electronic devices;
              and C60, which has potential applicatimns in several industries. The experiment
              on QWH is unique in connecting a real physical system with the one-dimensional
              square well potentials treated in elementary Quantum Mechanics or Modern
              Physics courses. Similarly, the experiment on C60 serves to illustrate
              rudiments of optical spectroscopy and its use in the characterization of new
              materials.     These experiments modernize the undergraduate curriculum and
              give the students a feel for frontier research in new materials. The equipment
              has a long life span and is adaptable for experiments on a wide variety of
              materials. The project includes the use of the new equipment in two
              undergraduate laboratory courses and also for undergraduate student research
              projects. Details of the experiments and student experiences will be shared
              with interested colleagues at other institutions through workshops,
              presentations at meetings and publications in journals - American Journal of
              Physics and others.
