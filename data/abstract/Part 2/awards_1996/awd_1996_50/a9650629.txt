Abstract    :
               This project is designed to correct the deficiency of nuclear magnetic
              resonance (NMR) instruction in the teaching laboratories. A 200-MHz NMR
              spectrometer, dedicated to undergraduate laboratory instruction, is being
              connected by ethernet to an existing silicon graphics server, one of a network
              of computers maintained for undergraduate instruction. Students in Introductory
              Organic Laboratory, Organic Honors Laboratory, Physical Chemistry Laboratory,
              Advanced Instrumental Methods Laboratory, and Undergraduate Research have
              hands-on experience with this instrumentation. Spectral data can be transferred
              from the spectrometer to the server, and students can analyze these data from
              computer terminals located in one of the instructional computer laboratories.
              By this procedure, students spend only that amount of time operating the
              instrument necessary to collect data and yet are able to spend as much time as
              necessary analyzing the data from computer terminals without occupying the
              instrument. This important analytical instrument thus serves a much larger body
              of students than it would if students also occupied the spectrometer while
              analyzing the data that they have already collected. This project also makes
              available on the server several molecular modeling and spectral simulation
              programs so students can calculate exchange rates from NMR lineshape analyses
              and evaluate energy-minimized models in terms of their consistence with NOE and
              J-coupling data.
