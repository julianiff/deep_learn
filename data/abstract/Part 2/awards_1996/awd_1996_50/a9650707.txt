Abstract    :
              This project trains undergraduates in noninvasive techniques to study biological
              principles and physiological functions of mammalian animals. They also receive
              exposure to new technologies that are developing exponentially, Ultrasound and
              computer equipment, for example, are used to monitor lean tissue and adipose
              accumulation, identify soft tissue injuries, and monitor reproductive
              functions. Ultrasound instruction and computer applications are also being
              implemented in laboratory sections of core classes. Overall, Instruction
              supplements concepts introduced in lecture, and students  become familiar with
              use of equipment and interpretation of ultrasound images and scientific data.
              The noninvasive capability of the equipment also provides a unique ability to
              study basic biological properties which are applicable to all mammals.
