Abstract    :
              This project produces scientifically literate, environmentally aware citizens
              among non-science majors, and competitively educated, critically thinking
              environmental biology majors. The focus is a watershed-stream complex integral
              to the campus. The scientific method is experienced by students through
              hands-on data acquisition, analyses and interpretations in assigned
              class-cooperative research projects. To educate students in policy processes,
              multiple classes coordinate data to produce an environmental impact assessment,
              at least once a year. The project also emphasizes the importance of data
              quality objectives, sampling protocols, precision in the field, documentation,
              and adequate databases from which the students can draw conclusions.
              Underrepresented groups in science are addressed, and a strong component
              involves field practicum experiences for individuals pursuing a teaching career
              with an emphasis in environmental studies.
