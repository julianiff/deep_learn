Abstract    :
              This project is helping expand molecular biology at the Institution. Molecular
              biology techniques are currently introduced in several freshman and sophomore
              courses for biology majors. In addition, an advanced course in molecular
              biology is being expanded and the new basic equipment is being used to perform
              a wider array of molecular biology techniques.  Three major goals are
              addressed. The first is an expansion of the number of molecular approaches
              available in the Molecular Biology course. This allows the laboratory to be
              organized as a cohesive package wherein students use molecular biology
              techniques to address a single biological question during the semester, rather
              than simply learning how to perform isolated techniques. Second, the equipment
              provides additional research opportunities and tools for the independent
              research projects that are required of all undergraduate majors in the Biology
              program. Third, a DNA fingerprinting laboratory is being added to the nonmajors
              Introductory Biology course to introduce these students to recent popular
              molecular biology techniques. A  new laboratory manual for Molecular Biology is
              also being developed,  will be disseminated at professional meetings, and will
              be made available on the Internet.
