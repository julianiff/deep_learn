Abstract    :
               This project is obtaining a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with
              microanalytical (EDX) capabilities. This instrument is to be used by students
              and faculty for instruction and undergraduate research. Previously absent from
              the instructional resources is the ability to image and nondestructively
              analyze samples at the micron and submicron levels. The department wants
              undergraduates to understand how reductionism can be used to understand the
              structure, function, and properties of materials encountered in the classroom
              and everyday life.   A user-friendly SEM system with tremendous flexibility has
              been chosen for a diversity of applications within the College of Science.
              Undergraduates encounter this technology in both introductory and advanced
              laboratory exercises. Additionally, the SEM can be made available to the ever
              growing number of undergraduates involved in scientific research. Through
              laboratory exercises and independent studies, it is estimated that this
              equipment affects approximately 950 undergraduate students each year.
              Additionally, community involvement can be ensured by interaction with local
              schools and through special programs for precollege, high school, and middle
              school students hosted by the university.
