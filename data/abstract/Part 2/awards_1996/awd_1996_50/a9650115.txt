Abstract    :
               This project supports the use of an atomic force microscope to strengthen and
              extend an already vigorous program of undergraduate participation in physics
              research. The microscope does not function as an isolated technological
              curiosity; instead, it is an essential component of the ongoing physics
              laboratory research program, and is intellectually and operationally accessible
              to undergraduates. The research program addresses topics of current interest in
              condensed matter physics while exposing students to a broad spectrum of modern
              experimental techniques critical to basic research as well as to fields of
              direct economic importance such as electrical engineering, nanofabrication, and
              materials science. These techniques include cryogenics, high vacuum, thin-film
              deposition, photolithography, electronic design and construction, machine shop
              practice, and electrical measurements. The new apparatus introduces fresh
              research opportunities for undergraduates and enhances the quality and
              significance of their work. The program may also be a useful and appealing
              model for other physicists interested in pursuing publishable research with
              undergraduate assistance.
