Abstract    :
               The Anthropology Department is using a multiple depth resistance survey system,
              a magnetic gradiometer survey system, and an electronic total station in order
              to upgrade its archaeology program. The departmental archaeologists are using
              this equipment during their summer fieldwork with student assistants in Alaska
              and Spain. Other departmental courses can benefit from the availability of
              original data produced through the use of these instruments. The equipment is
              also being made available to the new Environmental Sciences Program and is
              particularly valuable to the geologists involved in that program.   Remote
              sensing has become a critical aspect of modern archaeological research. As the
              archaeological database shrinks and excavation becomes ever more expensive,
              methods of noninvasively probing the earth to discover the structure of the
              archaeological record without excavating, or with only minimal testing of
              interpretations, become ever more attractive. Particularly in environmental
              impact analyses, the ability to investigate an area intensively with minimal
              disturbance is highly important to successful research. For all of these
              reasons, it is necessary to train students in the use of remote-sensing tools
              and in the interpretation of their output.
