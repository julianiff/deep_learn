Abstract    :
              The Atmospheric Sciences Department is modernizing its McIDAS student laboratory
               through acquisition of three new Pentium-based personal computers to upgrade
              the old McIDAS OS/2 PC-based network. Additional support equipment, in the form
              of a color laser printer and memory upgrades for a limited number of the old
              OS/2 PCs, is also being implemented to enable the department to fully exploit
              the future McIDAS OS/2 capabilities, to improve the data distribution system
              and for providing a processing base capable of hosting the intended
              improvements to the basic software as supplied by UNIDATA.  This new equipment
              is a vital tool in many of the classes wherein the students interpret and
              develop computer-based meteorological displays. The new OS/2-based PCs provide
              a workstation-like environment for expanded research opportunities for
              undergraduate and graduate students. The addition of these workstations to the
              laboratory frees older PCs for use by the introductory classes and
              laboratories, thus allowing the upper-class undergraduate students to
              concentrate their efforts on the new equipment.
