Abstract    :
              This Portland Community College (PCC) project creates an opportunity for science
              and non-science majors to increase their understanding of physical laws of
              nature as they apply to chemistry by using computer-interfaced instrumentation.
              PCC requests support from the National Science Foundation to acquire a modern
              Fourier Transform Infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR) for the chemistry
              department at PCC, Sylvania Campus, and critical pieces of molecular biology
              equipment to be housed at the Center for Research on Occupational and
              Environmental Toxicology (CROET). The acquisition of this equipment will create
              a dual-site instructional laboratory that will provide opportunities for
              introductory and advanced learning and training for the workforce for PCC
              students. The dual-site will also provide opportunities for faculty
              enhancement. The link between a community college such as PCC and a research
              institution such as CROET is innovative and will be a national model for the
              improvement of undergraduate laboratory instruction.
