Abstract    :
               This project involves development of 24 new or revised experiments to inject
              significant elements of investigation and discovery into introductory physics
              laboratories.  The project is using automatic data acquisition and analysis.
              Students are being guided through a series of explorations of the applicability
              of simple models for describing the phenomena under study. Computer-assisted
              data collection is allowing students to quickly alter initial and boundary
              conditions to get a broad overview of the validity of a model. The accuracy and
              precision of the data is allowing students to observe systematic departures of
              the observations from the predictions of a simple model. The students are
              encouraged to develop more sophisticated models to account for the observed
              discrepancies and to create a plan for subjecting those models to a test.   
              The exercises are being packaged in electronic format using a Computer-based
              Instructional Development (CID) tool.  This format is designed to allow
              students to find within the CID shell text, video, audio, and graphics
              materials that will serve as resources for how their equipment and programs
              function, and as a collection of queries and hints that will help in  synthesis
              and discovery activities.
