Abstract    :
               As electronic components decrease in size and increase in functional
              complexity, packaging becomes a very important issue. The requirements of
              electrical, thermal, mechanical, and material considerations in electronic
              packaging make it a highly interdisciplinary subject, in both academia and
              industry. This is one key technology in which U.S. industry must maintain its
              competitiveness in the global economy. To provide technical training to
              undergraduate students, this department is establishing an interdisciplinary
              Electronic Packaging and Materials Laboratory (EPM Lab).   The courses and
              laboratory are highly interdisciplinary. The project covers not only several
              subareas in electrical engineering, namely circuits and systems, microwave
              engineering, reliability and testing, and measurement and computational
              techniques, but also thermal and mechanical analyses of packaging and
              materials. This curriculum is training a new breed of engineers that are
              capable of integrating technologies from various engineering disciplines and
              enabling them to contribute to U.S. economic competitiveness in the area of
              EPM, particularly to the rapidly growing regional EPM industry. The laboratory
              can be housed in the new Electrical Engineering/Computer Science and
              Engineering Building to be completed in the fall of 1996.
