Abstract    :
              In order to better prepare the engineers for modern day technology, several
              enhancements are planned for the Mechanics of Deformable Bodies Laboratory. 
              The project has three goals: (a) to introduce the students to tests for dynamic
              loading, e.g. reversed cycle fatigue tests, (b) to simulate a real-life
              situation in the laboratory by tasking the students with the design and
              performance of their own tests that will characterize a new material or a
              product, and (c) to train the students in the use of industry standard testing
              equipment, and automatic data acquisition system. In order to successfully meet
              these goals, the lab will be augmented with a versatile material testing
              machine that is equipped with automatic control features, and a PC based data
              acquisition system for real-time data recording and analysis.                 
              The Mechanics of Deformable Bodies Lab is a requirement for both Mechanical and
              Civil Engineering majors.  Mechanical Engineering is the largest department in
              the college, and the combined student population of mechanical and Civil
              Engineering departments is more than 50 percent of all the engineering students
              enrolled.  Given the large number of students that are required to take this
              course and the fraction of them who are women (25 %) and minorities (15 %), the
              enhancement of the lab is imperative and its impact will be truly significant
