Abstract    :
              Department of Environmental Science administers the B.S. degree in Environmental
              Science. One of the course requirements for the degree is Geoscience, a course
              designed to integrate the study of physical science principles with the
              technology used to investigate and depict them. The College will expand the
              course and add laboratory and field exercises through acquistion of equipment
              to allow students to acquire and interpret  field data via map, stereoscope,
              current meter, sieve shaker, weather station, and ArcView software.  The
              project will allow the development of an integrated course in the physical
              sciences.  The course's laboratory experience will place emphasis on data
              acquisition and analysis rather than strictly on observations. Modern mapping
              and image interpretation will constitute a major portion of the laboratory and
              will permit the students to utilize methods and technology rarely available to
              undergraduates, particularly in smaller institutions.  By being open to
              non-majors, Environmental Science majors, and working professionals, the course
              also will provide the opportunity for students having different career paths to
              interact.
