Abstract    :
               This project involves development of a small computer laboratory for use in
              conjunction with upper-level physics courses. Physics is a field of education
              which develops understanding of the physical universe; however, the need for
              mathematical formalism often confounds the student to such an extent that the
              physical interpretation of events is not obvious. This computer laboratory is
              being used to help students make the relationships between physical events and
              the mathematical equations used to describe them. The laboratory is making
              computer hardware and software available to all the students, thereby leveling
              the playing field between students who have personal computers and those who do
              not. It frees students to spend most of their time developing an understanding
              of physics and not learning to use a computer.
