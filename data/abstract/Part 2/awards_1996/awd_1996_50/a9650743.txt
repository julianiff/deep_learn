Abstract    :
              This project is integrating the use of technology into mathematics classes to
              support reform in both in content and pedagog being developed by the
              Mathematics Department. The three areas in which the reform is being carried
              out are College Algebra, the Calculus Sequence, and a Mathematics Seminar for
              Prospective Secondary School Teachers.  Improvements to be made in the three
              classes include: (1) integration of calculator and computer activities into the
              classes; (2) addition of laboratory activities to encourage active student
              participation; (3) an emphasis on realistic applications; (4) addition of group
              projects; and (5) certain curriculum revisions.  These improvements are being
              phased in over a two year period.    The project begins by integrating
              calculator activities into a College Algebra and a Calculus I class.  Over a
              period of two years, they are incorporating calculator and computer activities,
              group projects and applications in all College Algebra and Calculus classes and
              the Mathematics Seminar for Prospective Secondary School teachers. The
              significance of this project lies in its potential to improve the mathematical
              preparation of a significant number of minority students and increase their
              chances of succeeding in mathematics related fields with a particular focus on
              prospective teachers.
