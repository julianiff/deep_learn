Abstract    :
               Of the over 600 students taking the 2-term general chemistry laboratory, only
              about 20 proceed through the senior-level instrumental analysis course. In this
              department, as in most level-one universities, only those students who complete
              this last laboratory course receive a thorough theoretical and practical
              (hands-on) experience with two of the most important and widely used analytical
              techniques_gas chromatography (GC) and high-performance liquid chromatography
              (HPLC).    However, many of the more than 200 students who do not advance past
              sophomore-level chemistry will use GC or HPLC in their careers. The need for
              these students to receive a sound fundamental background in the use and
              understanding of these techniques cannot be overly stressed. Furthermore, the
              learning experience of students who take the advanced lab classes would be
              enhanced if they had a stronger chromatography background in the lower-level
              courses. This project addresses the lack of coherent, step-by-step development
              of chromatographic theory and practice from the introductory through advanced
              level courses and the lack of practical, hands-on experience in GC and HPLC by
              the majority of students who take chemistry. The objective of this project is
              to alleviate both of these problems by integrating the teaching of
              chromatography into most of the undergraduate laboratory courses. This aim is
              being accomplished by modifying and replacing experiments in these courses to
              provide students with more theory and hands-on experience using the new
              equipment. This project is improving the level of chromatography instruction in
              the department and, through presentations at meetings and publications in
              education journals, may improve chromatography instruction at other schools.
