Abstract    :
              The aim of the project is to give a complete, better and real learning
              experience for the undergraduate students in the organic chemistry curriculum
              by added instrumentation and computer modeling. Recipe approach to organic
              synthesis will be transformed into a discovery approach by the addition of
              FT-IR spectrometer, requested through this proposal. The project integrates
              theory, computer modeling and FT-IR spectroscopy to give the students a
              collaborative, mini-corporate world experience. Students use FT-IR spectroscopy
              to follow chemical reactions, identify isomeric mixtures and for structural
              elucidation of products of chemical reaction. The theory of IR spectroscopy
              they learn comes alive by their personal handling of the IR spectrometer in the
              organic laboratory. Students as a team use SIPDE-SPARC approach to design and
              carry out their own synthesis; they use FT-IR spectroscopy to learn about
              quality control and product development in collaboration with a local industry.
              The collaborative, autonomous nature of these projects aided by FT-IR
              spectrometer and computer modeling gives the students a glimpse of the real
              professional world and prepares them adequately with all the requites of the
              cyberspace/virtual reality age.
