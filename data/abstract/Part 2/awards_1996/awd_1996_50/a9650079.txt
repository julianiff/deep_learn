Abstract    :
                  This project will incorporate a Fourier-transform nuclear magnetic resonance
              spectrometer in the undergraduate curriculum for Chemistry majors, Biology
              majors, Biochemistry majors, and premedical students at Whitman College. A new
              NMR will fill a serious gap in the otherwise excellent instrumentation
              available in this vigorous and growing science program. The existing
              continuous-wave NMR spectrometer is over twenty years old, and replacement
              parts are unavailable. The new instrument will permit a variety of additional
              experiments to be accomplished, and it will introduce students to several of
              the modern NMR techniques available. This instrument will also be used in
              Whitman's science research program, which involves most of the science majors
              in continuing research projects. These goals will all be accomplished in a
              highly cost-effective manner, because the proposed instrument uses a modern
              permanent magnet, avoiding the high purchase and operating costs, complexity,
              and cryogenic cooling associated with superconducting NMR instruments.
