Abstract    :
               This project details a three-phase plan to integrate technology into the entire
              mathematics curriculum using the symbolic algebra package, Maple. The first
              step is the upgrading of an existing calculus lab to a truly interactive
              electronic classroom. In the second phase, the department plans to weave
              technology and Maple into the fabric of the upper-level mathematics courses,
              changing the complexion of these courses from `theorem-proof` to
              `lab-discovery-discussion-proof.` The final phase introduces a new course for
              mathematics majors pursuing teaching certification (Mathematics and Technology
              for Secondary Education). Throughout the curriculum, Maple is being used to
              simplify computation and as a tool for discovery. Before now, students had used
              Maple only in the freshman calculus class. After that first year, Maple and all
              technology have been absent from the curriculum. The success experienced in
              calculus can be duplicated in all upper-level courses. With the new
              classroom/lab, the department has the facilities to implement a plan for
              `computing across the mathematics curriculum.`
