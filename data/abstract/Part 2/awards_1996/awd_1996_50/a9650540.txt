Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funding to develop a series of experiments for a required
              undergraduate laboratory offered to students in the department of Chemical and
              Environmental Engineering at the University of Arizona. Specifically, these
              experiments will be of both a bench-scale and a "unit          operations"
              type, and will provide ChE students experience in dealing with environmental
              problems from a process orientation. These experiments will impact two
              undergraduate courses which are required for a BS ChE degree. Affected will be
              the Science Lab, ChEE 307 and the Unit Operations  Lab, ChEE 304.     The two
              basic areas in which new experiments are proposed are "Bioremediation" and "Air
              Pollution Control". Within the bioremediation area, we propose to purchase
              ancillary equipment for our current Bioprocessing Facility, as well as
              equipment to establish five fermentation lab-stations. With these experiments,
              we hope to emphasize the biological aspects of environmental engineering, while
              at the same time introducing students to basic principles of biotechnology.
              Within the Air Pollution Control area, we propose to purchase ancillary
              equipment for improving current gas absorption experiments in the ChEE 304 lab
              (directing this experiment towards an environmental application), and equipment
              to initiate a detailed combustion experiment, also for use in the ChE Unit
              Operations Labs.
