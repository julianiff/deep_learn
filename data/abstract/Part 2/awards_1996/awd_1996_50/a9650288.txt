Abstract    :
              The School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of
              Technology has recently initiated a B.S. degree to provide a technically
              rigorous education for the next generation of earth and atmospheric scientists.
              One major goal of this program is to prepare majors for careers in a variety of
              environmental fields. We have designed a core and capstone course,
              Environmental Field Study, around the following criteria: (1) it will deal
              directly with the natural world and real environmental problems; (2) it will
              demonstrate and reinforce scientific principles learned in formal course work;
              (3) it will stress individual and/or team investigations; (4) equipment and
              procedures will be comparable to those likely to be encountered by students
              during their careers; (5) it will utilize the expertise of professionals in the
              field; and (6) students will take initiative in all aspects of the projects,
              from problem recognition to publication of findings.  Funds will be used to
              purchase a ground penetrating radar system and a terrain conductivity system to
              be used in undergraduate laboratory and field courses which will enable us to
              fulfill these goals.
