Abstract    :
               Charge coupled devices (CCDs) are two-dimensional optical detectors that are
              revolutionizing modern instrumentation. These computer-intensive detectors have
              excellent sensitivity and can collect an entire image within a fraction of a
              second. The images provide immediate information that can be stored as computer
              files to allow subsequent analysis of a series of images. Image analysis
              procedures vary, but basic detector usage is the same when used for medical
              instruments or on-line monitoring of product quality control. This wide
              diversity in application means that the ability to understand and use data from
              instruments using CCDs is rapidly becoming an essential skill for all science
              students. Unfortunately, teaching lab experiments using CCDs are nearly
              non-existent. This project uses a junior-senior level optics and new projects
              lab to develop a series of CCD experiments. Optical two-dimensional diffraction
              patterns are providing suitable standards to test the performance of CCDs and
              non-trivial, interesting experiments.
