Abstract    :
               This project focuses on a workshop-based approach to an introductory physical
              science course. An enhanced learning environment is being created that utilizes
              advanced technologies such as computers, networks, and digital media for
              student exploration and learning in physical science. The project adopts an
              inquiry-based approach to the materials that fosters student collaboration,
              practice of oral and written communication skills, and an appreciation for some
              of the fundamental principles of physics, chemistry, astronomy, and earth
              system science. Wherever appropriate, microcomputer-based laboratory techniques
              and digital multimedia are being used to enrich the learning experience and
              enable students to focus on building appropriate mental models of the
              scientific concepts being explored. Two sections (to be called The Science
              Studio) of a pilot physical science course are being offered in the workshop
              format, meeting twice per week for 2-hour sessions. One of the sections is
              offered within the university's honors program while the other has open
              enrollment. Widespread adoption of the workshop model after the pilot phase may
              affect in excess of 1,000 students per year.
