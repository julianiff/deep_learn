Abstract    :
               This project involves the creation of a Mathematica calculus laboratory to
              allow for the introduction of a reformed, laboratory-based, calculus course
              using the Duke/Bowdoin Project CALC materials. The 3-semester calculus sequence
              is the project's major source of contact with science majors. Mathematica is
              perhaps the most powerful piece of software currently available for use by
              mathematicians and scientists. The project's effort to present a
              laboratory-based calculus course enables the mathematics department and the
              science departments to build on the students' knowledge of Mathematica to
              enhance instruction in advanced courses. The project's immediate goals are
              construction of an optimum hardware/software teaching environment for a
              Mathematica calculus laboratory where students can use the calculus materials
              developed at Duke University, Bowdoin College, and Rockhurst College;
              dissemination of information regarding issues of teaching and group-learning
              mathematics in a laboratory environment to colleagues at both the collegiate
              and precollegiate level; forging of new relationships with five high schools in
              the area by offering calculus workshops based on laboratory experiences to
              faculty and students from those institutions; and comparison of the results of
              a 3-year project using Hewlett-Packard 48G graphing calculators in calculus
              with those using a Mathematica computer laboratory.
