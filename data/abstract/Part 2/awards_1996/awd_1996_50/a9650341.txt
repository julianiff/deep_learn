Abstract    :
               The Department of Chemistry is developing a project based on its acquisition of
              a single crystal x-ray diffractometer. Single crystal diffractometry has become
              the standard method for the characterization of crystalline materials and
              should be taught in the undergraduate curriculum. Recent improvements in
              instrumentation, including speed of data collection and significant reductions
              in price, make this feasible. In addition to the benefits of training in modern
              instrumental methods, there is a decided benefit to chemistry students through
              the enhancement of spatial reasoning skills from continued exposure to
              three-dimensional problems and three-dimensional images that can be manipulated
              by computer.   The department plans to introduce the instrument in a limited
              fashion in the freshman year and, with increasing sophistication, each
              subsequent year, culminating with a project in which students mount a crystal,
              collect data, assign a space group, and determine the structure during the
              senior year.
