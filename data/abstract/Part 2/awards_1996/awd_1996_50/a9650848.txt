Abstract    :
              This project  is upgrading laboratories in the upper-division biology core
              courses, chemistry, and the undergraduate student research program. These
              objectives are being met with the acquisition of fluorescence detection
              equipment that builds on and complements existing instrumentation. Laboratory
              activities, both improved and added, include B-galactosidase expression, DNA
              characterization, adenosine triphosphate measurement, cellular ion changes,
              chlorophyll identification, quantitation of nucleic acids, protein chemistry,
              enzyme kinetics, receptor assays, chemical experiments, and a number of
              techniques for undergraduate research projects. Also, implementation of these
              new laboratory experiences will expose students to sophisticated techniques
              that are rapidly becoming contemporary in biology and chemistry.
