Abstract    :
              This project involves acquisition of a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer
              (GC/MS) for use in environmental chemistry and hydrogeology courses, courses
              that relate to the interdisciplinary environmental programs at the institution.
               This instrument can be operated by students in an introductory or advanced
              environmental chemistry or hydrogeology course with a minimum of supervision,
              and its incorporation into laboratory coursework is being accompanied by
              changes in many pedagogical aspects of the courses.  The interdisciplinary
              nature of the environmental programs that are in place makes the equipment
              accessible to undergraduate students in all environmental science fields
              including chemistry, geology, engineering, and biological sciences.
