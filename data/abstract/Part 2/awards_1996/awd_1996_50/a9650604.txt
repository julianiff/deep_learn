Abstract    :
               Although undergraduate research in mathematics at this university has a long
              history of success, the department has never had a computer laboratory for this
              purpose. Research students have had to use workstations in faculty offices,
              graduate students' offices, and secretary offices when the machines were not
              being used by others. Often, students have to surrender workstations before
              they are finished with them. The move of the Department of Mathematics and
              Statistics to a new building in October of 1995 has further reduced the access
              to workstations previously used by undergraduates, but also provides the
              department with the opportunity to create a state-of-the-art mathematics
              computer laboratory for undergraduate research. The new building has been
              outfitted with a large computer laboratory featuring workstations for
              computation and visualization, word-processing, electronic literature searches,
              and Internet access. Both Sun and Silicon Graphics workstations are being
              implemented, as they both provide unique features that have played an important
              role in undergraduate research projects.
