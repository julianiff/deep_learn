Abstract    :
               Materials science is playing a major role in science and technology. Despite
              its importance, undergraduates have had little exposure to the major
              experimental techniques used in materials science, particularly X-ray
              diffraction. This project establishes an X-ray diffraction facility based on a
              modern X-ray powder diffractometer. The X-ray powder diffractometer can be used
              by intermediate- and advanced-level students majoring in chemistry and physics.
              The project targets materials research in both physics and chemistry. Five
              courses and an independent study in the two departments are affected by the
              project. Because few undergraduate colleges have an X-ray diffraction facility,
              this facility is serving as a model for the use of an X-ray diffractometer in
              the collaboration between chemistry and physics departments.
