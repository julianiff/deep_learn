Abstract    :
               This college has over 1,200 students in the engineering technologies and about
              200 in engineering science. This department is upgrading the modern optics
              component of the appropriate courses by introducing current instrumentation for
              the study of lasers. Through laboratory experiments, students gain an
              understanding of the principles and measurement techniques involved in the
              study and use of lasers.   The pedagogical format is that of a traditional
              laboratory, with careful prototyping leading to writeups that ensure maximum
              learning by the students. The laboratory centers around the principles of
              lasers and signal transmission. The use of Ti:Sapphire and Diode lasers affords
              the students the unique opportunity to study these principles while working
              with state-of-the-art technology. Laboratory exercises on the modulation and
              demodulation of signals for fiber-optic communication, and on the acousto-optic
              and electro-optic modulation, are combined with existing laboratories to
              complete the set of photonics laboratories applicable to both engineering and
              technology students. The particular laboratories developed under this program
              should provide a model for other laboratories on the principles of lasers and
              their application.
