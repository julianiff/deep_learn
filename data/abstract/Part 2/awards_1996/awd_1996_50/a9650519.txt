Abstract    :
              This project will provide a state-of-the-art Internet access laboratory to
              advance the teaching methods currently used in the Meteorology and Geology
              Laboratory courses. Both meteorology and geology represent two of the core
              offerings of the general science curriculum and thus serve a large and diverse
              student population. To date, the laboratory sections of these courses have
              incorporated antiquated lecture/lab manual methodologies of instruction
              featuring little investigative content. This project seeks to restructure these
              classes completely into a vibrant, hands-on learning environment through the
              use of internet image and data products, geographical information system
              software, and simulation products. This project allows for the construction of
              a World Wide Web homepage that contains selected data and training modules
              designed specifically for the meteorology and geology laboratory. Following 1
              year of construction, student operation, and student evaluation, the homepage
              can be made public to the entire environmental studies community.    To be
              effective, the science laboratory curriculum must reflect the latest
              innovations and instructional technology. This project prepares science majors
              with effective computational analysis skills that they can use in their own
              specific area of interest. For nonmajors, exposure to this technology may
              encourage them to pursue higher-level science and mathematics courses. This
              laboratory is of particular importance for future primary and secondary
              educators, as these courses may represent their only exposure to meteorological
              and geological technology.
