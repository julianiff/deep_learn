Abstract    :
              This project is establishing a Center to address pressing needs in the
              undergraduate program at different curricular levels.  As a result, General
              Biology for majors now addresses entry-level molecular biology concepts in
              their laboratory. Molecular biology technologies are also being added to core
              courses such as cell biology, genetics, and immunology. The Biotechnology
              Center provides a well-equipped and centralized laboratory that is shared by
              students in several courses. The Biotechnology Center is also a valuable
              resource for undergraduate students pursuing independent research projects.
              Finally, the Center enhances the department's teacher training program by
              providing a nucleus for summer courses in biotechnology for pre-service and
              high school teachers.
