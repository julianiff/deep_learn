Abstract    :
               Since its introduction in the early 1980's, capillary electrophoresis (CE) has
              grown to become an essential tool for high resolution separations of biological
              macromolecules. Continuing method development has extended applications to a
              wide variety of charged and neutral compounds of all sizes. To be prepared for
              future employment and advanced schooling, students should have more than
              textbook knowledge of this instrumental method. To provide this experience,
              experiments that involve use of a CE system are being developed for three
              upper-level chemistry laboratories. Students in instrumental analysis are
              analyzing a commercial cold/sinus remedy using both reversed-phase liquid
              chromatography and capillary electrophoresis. They are observing the
              differences in the two separation methods and the importance of eluent
              character and pH. Students in the standard physical chemistry laboratory are
              measuring several physical parameters fundamental to the electrophoresis
              process. A new physical chemistry laboratory, emphasizing the properties of
              biological and synthetic macromolecules is being offered as an alternate to the
              standard course. Students who choose that option use CE to follow the kinetics
              of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction.
