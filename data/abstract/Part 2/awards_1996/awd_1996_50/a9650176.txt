Abstract    :
               The Astronomy Department offers two undergraduate laboratory courses, optical
              and radio astronomy, intended for astronomy majors and prospective astronomy
              majors and physics, engineering, and geophysics majors. The curricula are
              rigorous, but less structured than traditional lab courses, requiring extra
              effort and commitment from the professor and resulting in very close contact
              between teacher and student. This environment is stimulating to the students
              and encourages more students to pursue a science major.   The department is
              adding a third laboratory course, in infrared astronomy, and is expanding and
              improving its facilities to accommodate more students.
