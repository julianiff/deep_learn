Abstract    :
               A new program leading to the bachelor of science degree in Cell and Molecular
              Biology received state approval in December 1992 and began admitting students
              in Fall 1993. The degree is offered through the Biomedical Sciences Department.
              The program is directed toward students whose career aims include postgraduate
              education and, therefore, require exposure to the subject matter at the most
              sophisticated level possible. The project aims to improve the effectiveness of
              the program curriculum by providing access to a variety of software packages
              including the nucleic and protein databases and programs. A cooperative
              arrangement has been established with the University of Missouri-Columbia (UMC)
              DNA Core Facility to make available the University of Wisconsin Genetics
              Computer Group programs. Two faculty at UMC and one at this university are
              collaborating on this component of the project. Furthermore, faculty members
              are upgrading three courses and initiating one new course in the Cell and
              Molecular Biology major. The project provides funding for the purchase of six
              computers and a printer needed to train students in the use of the databases
              and other programs related to molecular biology. Subsequent to proving the
              project, the system can be offered to other institutions throughout the state
              and region.
