Abstract    :
                 We are developing a prototype system for social science research methods
              instruction in a virtual laboratory environment. The lab is designed to address
              a number of common problems in teaching social science research methods to
              undergraduates: student motivation, access to learning and methods software,
              the integration of all stages of the research process into methods courses, and
              the limited variety of research experiences available. The virtual lab, which
              we call the Virtual Institute for Social Science Research (VISSR), is used by
              social science students as a distributive computing (client-server) application
              that provides integrated access to essential tutorials, basic data collection
              and analysis routines, and, perhaps more important, live interaction with
              others over networks and the Internet. Once developed, the client-server
              software bundle will be made available over the Internet, as well as from other
              media.
