Abstract    :
               Undergraduates often view the engineering curriculum as a disjointed array of
              courses connected only by the prefix in front of the course number. When the
              students view the laboratory experiments_experiences which should reinforce and
              extend the principles forwarded in theory courses_as a potpourri, the problem
              becomes more exacerbated. This project is attempting to combat this problem by
              developing laboratory experiences that build upon one other. Mechanical
              dissection has worked in teaching introductory engineering students. A twist to
              this proven method, "process dissection" is forwarded to breakdown a chemical
              process into its series of physicochemical phenomena. As in any dissection,
              diagnostics are important. In the case of chemical engineering, this requires
              well-instrumented, controlled experiments and analytical instrumentation. The
              subsequent reintegration of the process should help students better appreciate
              the laboratory experience. The instructional development is using interactive
              group activities as a way to integrate student learning.
