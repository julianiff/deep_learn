Abstract    :
               The Geosciences Department recognizes the importance of hands-on,
              field-oriented experiences for undergraduates, especially in the high
              employment area of environmental consulting. To this end, the project is
              establishing a field laboratory for use by students in General Geophysics and
              Hydrogeology, two of the most popular upper-level elective courses in the
              Geology major.   The site, to be located in glacial deposits sitting on top of
              faulted metamorphic bedrock, includes buried targets for surface geophysical
              exploration and established observation wells for standard hydrologic testing
              and groundwater investigation. Surface geophysical measurements are being made
              with existing equipment, but additional equipment can be used to provide
              exposure to electrical resistivity, electromagnetic, very low frequency, and
              seismic reflection techniques common in the environmental industry. Basic
              equipment used to allow for pumping tests, slug tests, porosity studies, water
              quality studies, and water flow investigations are also being used in this
              project.   The extensive geophysical and hydrogeologic data collected from the
              site is being archived on CD-ROM using the method of dynamic digital maps and
              will be made available to the geologic community. In addition, the site, a
              unique teaching tool for field geophysics and hydrogeology, is being made
              available to interested professors and students in the region.
