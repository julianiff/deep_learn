Abstract    :
               Recent research in operating systems has led to major strides in the
              structuring of services using microkernels. Leading researchers and developers
              agree that future systems will be based on microkernels and will rely on
              customization of specific operating systems services to a specific application
              environment.   In response to the trend toward customizing operating systems,
              this project focuses on developing an undergraduate operating systems
              laboratory built upon a network of dedicated Power PCs using the IBM
              Microkernel. The department is replacing its existing undergraduate-level
              operating systems and computer networks courses with two new courses, Operating
              Systems I and II, that use the IBM microkernel-based system as a reference
              point and a medium to perform system-level experimentation. Class materials,
              including lab exercises based on the microkernel, can be made available over
              World Wide Web. This project is securing a network of IBM Power PC
              workstations.
