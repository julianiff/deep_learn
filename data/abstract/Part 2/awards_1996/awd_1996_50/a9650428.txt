Abstract    :
               Through this project, the department is upgrading its analytical/inorganic
              program and improving and expanding upper-level laboratories by adding
              instructional grade instruments and modest facilities for XRD analysis.   As
              part of the project, the department is delivering an innovative course in
              analytical methods applied to inorganic solid-state materials. The course
              follows the upper-level lecture course in inorganic chemistry, which provides
              students with basic theory in structure and stability and gives them a hands-on
              introduction to molecular modeling (MO) and MO methods. With this background,
              students can synthesize and characterize derivatives of a selected class of
              interesting solid-state materials. Characterization includes structural
              analyses by single crystal x-ray diffraction, XRD, determination of magnetic
              susceptibility, EPR analysis of magnetic state, and analysis of frontier states
              and redox chemistry. The class of materials selected demonstrates interesting
              magnetic, electrical, and spectral properties and crystallize in multiple
              crystal habits. Thus, they serve as an excellent "medium" of analysis. A pilot
              course has been mounted and run successfully with eight students. As a
              team-taught course, this course is being inserted into the curriculum without
              decreasing other course offerings and without burdening the instructors.
