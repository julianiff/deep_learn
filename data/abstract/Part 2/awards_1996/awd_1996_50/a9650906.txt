Abstract    :
              Opportunities for enhancing undergraduate education in geosciences via a range
              of computer-based technologies are growing extremely rapidly. These
              opportunities include models and visualizations of processes that take place at
              large space and/or time scales, maps and satellite imagery, digitizers, large
              data bases, and software for data analysis. The objective of this proposal is
              to significantly improve the education we provide by increasing our
              capabilities to incorporate these opportunities in courses for our general
              education students and undergraduate majors in geology, hydrology, earth
              sciences, earth sciences teaching, and ultimately an emerging marine sciences
              curriculum. To accomplish this, we are seeking funding for the purchase of 16
              personal computers that would be installed in a computer classroom and linked
              into the department and University networks and the Internet, along with basic
              software that will allow us to run the applications we have identified.
