Abstract    :
               This project involves development of the Advanced Physics Laboratory course to
              allow undergraduate students to study select topics from atomic, molecular, and
              solid state physics and learn the methods of modern experimental techniques. A
              computer-interfaced optical spectroscopy system (spectrophotometer) is helping
              to develop three new experiments on atomic physics, molecular physics, and
              quantum mechanics. The experiments are measuring the Rydberg constant, isotope
              structure, and fine structure for the atomic transitions in hydrogen, the
              molecular optical transitions of N2, and the energy gap of silicon, germanium,
              and gallium arsenide. Students can greatly benefit from training on the
              computer-interfaced, high-resolution equipment, while learning essential laws
              of physics.
