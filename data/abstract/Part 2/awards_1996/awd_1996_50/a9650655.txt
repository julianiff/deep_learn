Abstract    :
               This college's Biotechnology Program, launched in 1994, is the only 2-year
              degree program in the state of Ohio. Biotechnology prepares majors for
              employment in this rapidly expanding leading-edge technology. In addition to
              intensive lecture/lab courses, majors are required to conduct a capstone
              research project and to participate in the college's nationally recognized
              co-op program. Graduates earn an Associate of Applied Science degree that
              transfers to 4-year degree programs. For nonmajors in the Associate of Science
              (AS) transfer program, the Biotechnology sequence fulfills the sophomore-level
              science component. The program is advised by a partnership committee of
              industry and research laboratory scientists.   This project improves
              undergraduate instruction by enabling students in all five Biotechnology
              courses to work extensively with eukaryotic systems (yeast and insect cells),
              as well as with the traditional prokaryotic systems, across the range of
              biotechnology techniques. In addition, the project significantly expands
              student biotechnology lab experience with growth, maintenance, and storage of
              prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells; centrifugation; column chromatography (gel
              filtration, ion-exchange, affinity); and antibody-antigen interactions (ELISA).
                The Biotechnology improvements can annually affect 40 majors, 50 A.S.
              students, and 250 Health Sciences students (Microbiology and Immunology
              courses). The project can also generate SEM pipeline workshops for 11-12
              graders (100/year) and teachers (50/year) and awareness for 7-12 graders
              (160/year).
