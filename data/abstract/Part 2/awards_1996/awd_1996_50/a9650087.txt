Abstract    :
               To enrich the chemistry experience for nonmajors through the development of an
              introductory chemistry laboratory course for honors and nonhonors students, the
              department is purchasing a Parr Plain Jacket Oxygen Bomb Calorimeter and a
              Tecator Kjeldahl apparatus. In the laboratory, students may initially perform
              small-scale experiments from the Chemistry in Context Laboratory Manual, many
              of which involve food analyses. Using the new equipment, students analyze the
              caloric and nitrogen contents of popular foods as these determinations are
              performed in the food industry. Such an opportunity both promotes student
              interest and provides students with a realistic knowledge of the utility of
              chemistry. Inclusion of the Kjeldahl analysis provides a clear illustration of
              the risk/benefit considerations made when working with solutions and compounds
              that are commonly thought of as being hazardous.
