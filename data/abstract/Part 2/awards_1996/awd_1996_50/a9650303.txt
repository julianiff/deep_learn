Abstract    :
               Computers located at student stations within freshman chemistry laboratories
              are being used in three ways:  sophisticated data acquisition and analysis,
              distribution of locally produced digital video clips of faculty research
              related to each experiment being done by the students, and electronic
              distribution of locally produced instructions for each experiment (text,
              diagrams, photos, and digital video clips). The overall goal is to make
              freshman chemistry students believe that they are doing chemistry the way
              professional chemists do and not just learning material that many of the
              students have already seen in high schools. The introduction of the digital
              video clips of research not only shows that the freshman chemistry experiments
              are important and relevant to `genuine chemistry,` but it also gives the
              department an opportunity to show how the same techniques that are taught in
              freshman chemistry laboratory courses are an essential part of extremely
              important chemical research.
