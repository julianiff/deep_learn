Abstract    :
               The intent of this project is to equip a laboratory in which students in
              networking courses can complete exercises and perform experiments that enhance
              the classroom learning occurring through lectures and discussions. This
              laboratory is being used as a facility for developing and refining a set of
              appropriate exercises and experiments which may then be shared with computer
              science teachers at the undergraduate level.   Networking is assuming an
              increasingly central role in computing. Distributed systems are displacing
              centralized computing facilities. This paradigm shift has no greater impact on
              the curriculum than in the area of data communications and networking.  The
              change from a world of minis and mainframes to workstations, LANs, and WANs
              must be reflected in the computer science curriculum. The new lab addresses
              both the hardware and the software aspects of this change.   As a consequence
              of this shift, employers have an increased need for and a high expectation of
              networking expertise on the part of the students that they hire. Also,
              coursework and research at the graduate level are increasingly devoted to
              networks and distributed systems. The lab provides the students with concrete
              examples of things discussed conceptually in the lecture. The students also
              gain valuable familiarity with hardware and software products that they may be
              working with in their future careers or research situations.
