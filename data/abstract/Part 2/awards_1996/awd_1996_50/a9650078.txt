Abstract    :
               The objective of this project is the revitalization of an advanced senior-level
              design project laboratory in the wireless communications field. The design of a
              large mixed analog-digital project serves as a capstone design experience for
              the seniors by merging concepts from circuit, system, communication, and linear
              system theory into a single practical project. Only through the use of theory
              learned in lecture can the students truly grasp the material. The wireless
              project, incorporating some digital communications, helps to tie together many
              of the concepts of electrical engineering. The large size of the project,
              requiring about 10 students, is purposely configured to simulate an industrial
              product development cycle. The project is divided into smaller tasks that
              subteams of about three students can design and build. During the course of the
              project, each subteam is required to present to the entire team a review of
              their circuit specifications, a review of their design, and finally a review of
              the experimental results. Written documentation of the experimental results
              once the entire system is integrated is required. This experience helps the
              students to learn teamwork and communication skills and to see engineering
              concepts at work.
