Abstract    :
               Laser-based instruments for optical spectroscopy provide new and exciting
              experiences for students in undergraduate physical chemistry and analytical
              chemistry courses. This project incorporates miniature pulsed Nd:YAG and
              tunable dye lasers into several experiments designed to illustrate key features
              of molecular structure and dynamics. Students are using lasers to record
              spectra with much higher resolution than is offered by traditional
              spectroscopic instruments. Fine structure observed in laser-based spectra
              reveal couplings between molecular motions that students often struggle to
              visualize. Time-resolved laser-induced-fluorescence studies illustrate the
              competition between radiative and nonradiative relaxation mechanisms.
              Multiphoton excitation and resonance-ionization spectroscopy using short pulses
              can introduce fast electro-optic technology into physical and analytical
              chemistry courses. Laser Raman spectroscopy complements existing nuclear
              magnetic resonance, gas chromatograph/mass spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform
              infrared capabilities for chemical identification in synthesis courses.  
              Students engaged in undergraduate research gain hands-on experience with
              individual hardware components in modular instrument configurations. The
              presence of modern spectroscopy in the undergraduate curriculum strongly
              enhances student preparation for advanced-degree programs in chemistry,
              medicine, and engineering.
