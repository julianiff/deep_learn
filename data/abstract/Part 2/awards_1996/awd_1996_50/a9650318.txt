Abstract    :
              This project involves the acquisition of essential equipment to upgraded a
              departmental tissue culture laboratory.  As a result, the undergraduate
              neuroscience program has been enhanced and there is a significant impact on
              other undergraduate courses, including general biology, cell biology, and
              special problems courses in biology, and undergraduate independent study
              research. The core of the neuroscience program consists of lecture and
              laboratory-oriented courses that emphasize cellular and molecular aspects of
              neurobiology. Laboratory exercises complement the principles and techniques
              being discussed in lectures by providing students with hands-on experience in
              tissue culture and other commonly used techniques in biological research.   Our
              urban area is currently one of the most economically depressed in the nation.
              Therefore, the project is also striving to increase the appeal of biological
              careers to economically disadvantaged minority students from the city and
              surrounding areas.
