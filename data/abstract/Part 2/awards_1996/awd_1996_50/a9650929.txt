Abstract    :
              This project focuses on investigations and education in molecular biology.
              Freshmen general biology laboratories are being redesigned with more emphasis
              on molecular biology and biotechnology. The revised curriculum also benefits
              upper division courses such as cell biology and genetics. More opportunities
              are also available for individual molecular biology student research projects.
              More complex techniques and experiments now include cell culturing, protein and
              nucleic acid analysis, Southern hybridization, preparation of gene libraries,
              use of polymerase chain reaction, statistical analysis of generated data using
              personal computers, and DNA sequencing. Overall, the project enables students
              who complete the general biology, cell  Biology, and molecular genetics courses
              to gain experience in virtually all of the major molecular biology techniques
              in a cumulative, educational manner. It is also expected that students will be
              well prepared for individual undergraduate research projects and use techniques
              in molecular biology.
