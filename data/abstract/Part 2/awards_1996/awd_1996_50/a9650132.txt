Abstract    :
               This project is establishing a Regional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              Facility in the central Shenandoah Valley. The facility enables students to
              experience, first hand, the capabilities of a fully equipped, high-field, NMR
              spectrometer. Through the use of a computer network, students can use the
              instrument remotely for data acquisition from their individual home
              institutions. The facility is used by chemistry majors and non-majors
              throughout selected levels of the chemistry curriculum.   In addition,
              undergraduate research is being enhanced at each of the institutions in the
              consortium. The instrumentation in the facility enables users to perform more
              sophisticated experiments that stimulate new projects and collaborations among
              the participating students and faculty. The addition of the high-field NMR
              spectrometer also enhances the university's NSF/REU program, which provides
              meaningful summer research experiences for groups traditionally
              underrepresented in the sciences and their faculty mentors. The facility allows
              them to perform higher quality research, and attract additional students and
              faculty to the program.
