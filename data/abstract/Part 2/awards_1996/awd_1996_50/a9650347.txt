Abstract    :
               As the complexity of digital circuits increases continuously_the Intel
              Pentium-P6 processor (1995), for example, has 5.5 million transistors while the
              80386 (1989) had less than one-half million_the cost of device testing has also
              increased sharply. The rising complexity of testing has shifted more and more
              of the testing responsibility toward the design engineer. Today, many of the
              testing issues must be planned within the earlier design phase. This project
              introduces the various issues and corresponding techniques employed in testing
              to digital design courses. To implement this idea, the department is developing
              an innovative laboratory for linking design and testing through hands-on
              experiments.   The integration of testing with design is an important attribute
              within the range of abilities of a modern day undergraduate computer
              engineering student. Thus, the project addresses this emerging need through the
              use of a laboratory with a computer-assisted design (CAD) tools and testing
              facility. Students can implement their ASIC (Application Specific Integrated
              Circuit) designs through a set of PLDs (Programmable Logic Device) without the
              waiting period for IC fabrication. Many of the testing techniques such as DFT
              (Design for Testability) and BIST (Build-in-Self-Test) must be planned in the
              design phase by students. Converting the simulation data into test programs and
              performing the actual testing on ATE (Automatic Test Equipment) for students'
              own designs can not only offer hands-on experience, but also provide them an
              integral perspective of the design of digital systems.   The laboratory
              infrastructure is capable of meeting the demands of design and test as an
              integral unit. This facility can provide three courses in the digital system
              area for more than 100 undergraduate students annually. This department's
              approach and experience can help other ECE/CS programs to offer an enriched
              education in digital design to their students.
