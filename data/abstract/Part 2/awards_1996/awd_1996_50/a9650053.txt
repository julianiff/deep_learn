Abstract    :
               This project uses an innovative approach to upgrade the welding curriculum by
              offering a new course teaching the principles and application of robotic
              welding and by introducing the latest welding technology through a
              multidisciplinary team approach, simulating an industrial automated production
              environment.   Students, using a robotic system, synthesize conventional
              welding theory and skills training with automated application. The robot,
              indexing fixture, and power sources, when integrated are capable of replicating
              the automated production welding processes found in industry.   The final
              project exposes students from welding, machine tool, computer-assisted design,
              automated manufacturing, computer-integrated manufacturing, and mechanical
              engineering technology programs to a realistic manufacturing exercise. Students
              use knowledge gained from their curricula as they work together in teams
              (manufacturing units) to develop and manufacture a product (project).   A
              project of this magnitude, involving teamwork, electronic communication,
              planning, and problem-solving is invaluable to students entering an
              industrial/manufacturing environment.
