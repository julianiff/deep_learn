Abstract    :
               This project, for use in senior level chemical engineering laboratory courses,
              addresses the chemical reaction engineering principles relevant to the
              treatment of waste water from microelectronics processing and from metal
              finishing and refining industries.  Its purpose is to demonstrate to students
              that waste water containing dilute toxic metal ions (50-200 ppm) can be treated
              by electrodeposition of the metals at a porous cathode; to enhance students'
              experience with chemical reaction engineering by determining the reaction rate
              constant of the electrodeposition reaction, its activation energy, and the
              rate-determining step; to improve students' economic consciousness by
              evaluating the current efficiency and energy consumption of the process; and to
              perform a scale-up process design and cost estimate of the electrolytic
              treatment process, comparing the results to a competing process such as
              precipitation and landfill. Participants assemble the equipment, carry out
              preliminary experiments, develop a lab manual, and integrate the project into
              an undergraduate chemical engineering laboratory course.
