Abstract    :
               The chemistry department is purchasing a TECMAG Mercury-S12/LoEC computer
              upgrade for the Varian CFT-20 Fourier-transform nuclear magnetic resonance
              (NMR) system currently used for undergraduate instruction. This equipment
              replaces the current Varian 620 minicomputer with a Macintosh 7100/80 computer
              and specially designed spectral acquisition boards, interfaces, Deskwriter 660
              printer, and MacNMR software. This upgrade to an industry standard 32-bit
              computer with a wide selection of low-cost I/O devices, enables students to
              obtain one-dimensional or two-dimensional carbon and proton NMR spectra with a
              minimum of supervision.  The current instrument, a gift from PPG Industries,
              has reliable electromagnet and solid-state instrument control circuitry but
              suffers from problems with the embedded minicomputer, oscilloscope visual
              interface, and cumbersome NMR spectral acquisition software that is difficult
              to program and is contained on cassettes and 8-inch floppy disks.  This upgrade
              extends the life of the current instrument, improves the user interface,
              expands its use for both routine and advanced spectral acquisition, and serves
              as an upgrade model for other colleges in the Appalachian College Association
              with similar, failing electromagnet NMR spectrometers.
