Abstract    :
               This project provides funds to purchase equipment to fully implement the
              introduction of the study of immunology. The equipment is basic, but allows
              undergraduate biology and biochemistry students to master an understanding and
              the techniques of cell culture. The first item, the CO2 incubator, is being
              used to grow cell lines purchased for student study of B and T lymphocytes,
              cell response to mitogens, and cellular communication. This incubator is of
              great assistance in cell biology and microbiology courses, providing the
              opportunity for advanced cell culture studies and the inclusion of animal
              virology (components of these courses that are not currently possible). The
              second item, the clean bench, improves the students' rate of success in their
              experimentation by reducing possible contamination. The clean bench is also
              being used in other undergraduate courses (cell biology, biochemistry,
              genetics, neurobiology, microbiology). This equipment is also available for
              student independent research, which is encouraged following completion of the
              immunology course.
