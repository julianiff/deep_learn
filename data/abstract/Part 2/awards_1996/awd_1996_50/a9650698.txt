Abstract    :
               The Chemistry Department has been consistent over the past 2 decades in
              anticipating and addressing the needs of its chemistry students. However, the
              department currently lacks sufficient molecular modeling capabilities to engage
              the students throughout the curriculum. The predictive and visualization
              potential of this methodology is becoming increasing important for both
              learning about and working in chemistry. This project concerns the purchase of
              five CAChe Worksystems running on Power Macintosh 7500 computers, which greatly
              increase the hands-on access to molecular modeling for students in the
              chemistry program.   Students may become proficient with a wide variety of
              computational methods through a series of experiments in courses at all levels
              of the curriculum, including introductory chemistry, organic chemistry,
              advanced inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, advanced organic chemistry,
              biochemistry, and research. In these experiments, students learn to visualize
              molecules in three dimensions, determine optimum geometries of various
              molecules, determine rotational energy barriers, correlate computed and
              observed properties, predict thermodynamic properties of molecules and
              reactions, and study reaction mechanisms by modeling intermediates, transition
              states, and activation energies. These experiments start with basic skills and
              build progressively to more sophisticated experiments through which the
              students gain an appreciation for both the power and limitations of molecular
              modeling.
