Abstract    :
               Graduates from both the Department of Manufacturing Technology and the
              Department of Mechanical Engineering often go into industrial positions in
              which they are directly involved with the usage of computer-assisted
              design/computer-assisted manufacturing equipment. Students in both of these
              departments are required to take courses that include use of CAD software.  
              The goal of this project is to enhance several CAD-related courses by providing
              the equipment necessary to produce physical prototypes. The previous content of
              these CAD courses has included instruction in both two-dimensional and
              three-dimensional modeling concepts. This project is expanding the capabilities
              of the CAD laboratories to include the capacity to produce actual physical
              prototypes of three-dimensional models described in a CAD system. This gives
              students quick feedback regarding the validity of their designs by allowing
              them to examine, hold, and in some cases, assemble and test models of complex
              three-dimensional objects. This equipment exposes students to new concepts and
              technologies that are becoming prevalent in industry today. Since the
              institution has not previously had a rapid prototyping system, this new
              equipment is also fostering greater cooperation among various departments and
              should generate opportunities for interdepartmental projects.
