Abstract    :
               This project involves upgrading the observing facilities at the Astronomy
              Department. Recently, the capabilities of charged coupling devices (CCD), such
              as cameras, computers, and telescopes, have dramatically increased while prices
              have remained stable or even decreased. This has led to a great increase in the
              "user-friendliness" of realizable observing systems. The project can capitalize
              on this state of affairs by providing state-of-the-art CCD camera systems with
              powerful computers and computer-assisted telescopes for use in the lower- and
              upper-divisional undergraduate laboratories. This upgrade in equipment provides
              additional possibilities for the astronomy majors, opens up new approaches for
              general students taking astronomy as an elective, and presents a new dimension
              for people coming to observatory Open House. This project represents a great
              enhancement to the observing possibilities currently available, as well as a
              variety of new types of instruction, laboratory projects, and opportunities for
              undergraduate education.
