Abstract    :
               Many students currently lack the high level of mathematical skill needed in a
              modern electrical engineering curriculum. In many of the foundational courses
              in the electrical engineering discipline, a student's lack of adequate
              mathematical skills is one of the primary barriers to effective learning and,
              ultimately, successful completion of degree requirements. Compounding the
              problem are many such courses taught using the format of a traditional lecture
              in which students are mostly passive listeners.   The department's goal is to
              help the students overcome the barriers of inadequate mathematics preparation
              and the difficulty of understanding many of the fundamental concepts of
              electrical engineering. This project pursues an active learning strategy in a
              dedicated computer equipped classroom with on-line access to Mathematica. Such
              a facility can significantly improve the level of classroom interaction between
              instructor, student, and lecture material. By making mathematics more
              accessible to the average student, the participants expect increased student
              participation and improved learning.   The formation of a departmental
              computer-equipped classroom is a logical next step in a 3-year sequence of
              experiments with computer-assisted learning in four undergraduate courses. The
              classroom can dramatically improve present capabilities, allowing an increase
              in the number of sessions and courses. Within its first 2 years, the project
              may have an impact on 10 electrical engineering courses and involve all
              engineering faculty.
