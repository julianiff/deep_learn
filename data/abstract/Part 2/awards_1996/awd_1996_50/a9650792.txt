Abstract    :
               This institution is acquiring computers, interfaces, appropriate sensors, and
              support equipment for three chemistry laboratories that make possible the
              introduction of microcomputer-based laboratories into the general chemistry
              program. Approximately 700 students take general chemistry each year. The
              acquisition of this equipment enables students to collect, display, and analyze
              data rapidly such that students can investigate graphical relationships,
              discover mathematical relationships, handle statistical analyses, and design
              new experiments in an effort to enhance critical thinking capability. An
              emphasis is being placed on the investigation and interpretation of graphical
              patterns and mathematical relationships within the general chemistry laboratory
              program. The project provides for the development of new experiments dealing
              with gas laws, spectrophotometry, thermochemistry, and electrochemistry that
              utilize the newly acquired computer systems. In addition, all general chemistry
              students work in teams to design a team experiment using the new equipment.
              This is the project's culminating activity in the general chemistry laboratory
              program.
