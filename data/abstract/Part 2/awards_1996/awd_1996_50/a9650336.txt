Abstract    :
               Recognizing that today's student learns better from interactive systems than
              from textbooks and that introductory chemistry courses are generally viewed as
              `student unfriendly,` the department plans to provide all students in the core
              General Chemistry course access to computer-based interactive learning
              materials directly in their primary study area.   This project is an integral
              part of the department's long-range plan to change the way General Chemistry is
              taught and to bring the traditional `computer laboratory` directly into
              students' dormitory rooms. The university is providing the necessary
              infrastructure, and this department has experience with networks and with the
              graphical molecular modeling necessary to drive this project.   The objective
              is to provide interactive software that students can access outside the
              classroom. Students use molecular visualization as a means of understanding the
              three-dimensional nature of chemical structures and envisioning the dynamic
              nature of chemical reactions to complement their classroom and laboratory
              experience.   Additionally, this project offers a solution to the nationwide
              problem of obsolete computer hardware and the high service demands placed upon
              chemistry faculty responsible for dedicated computer laboratories.
