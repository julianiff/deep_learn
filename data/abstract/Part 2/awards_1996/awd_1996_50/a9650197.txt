Abstract    :
               In order to add new experiments across the upper-division Physical Chemistry
              laboratory curriculum, the university is purchasing thermal analysis and
              size-exclusion chromatography instrumentation. This equipment has a wide range
              of instructional uses, both as a cornerstone to a series of characterization
              experiments in the newly developed Introduction to Polymer Science course and
              as a part of the Biophysical and Physical Chemistry laboratories.   Several
              experiments that use differential scanning calorimetry and size-exclusion
              chromatography as primary tools are being used to integrate the equipment into
              the upper-division undergraduate laboratories. These experiments include an
              examination of the thermal behavior in polyethylene, two high-performance
              composite materials (polyetheretherketone and a polyester of similar chemical
              nature), agarose gel, and the binary napthalene-diphenylamine systems, as well
              as an analysis of molecular weight concepts in the polystyrene,
              polymethylmethacrylate, and cellulose polymers. Adding these experiments can
              improve the university's undergraduate laboratory curriculum in terms of
              modernization and interdisciplinary focus.
