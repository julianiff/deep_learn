Abstract    :
               The use of advanced composite materials in the aerospace, automotive,
              electronic, marine, medical, and sporting goods industries has grown
              considerably over the past 2 decades. Furthermore, it has been estimated that
              composites growth will exceed 500  of 1990 usage by the year 2000. Although it
              has become increasingly important for undergraduate students to be exposed to
              the manufacture and mechanical behavior of these materials by the time they
              graduate, the present curriculum does not address this important class of
              materials.   In order to address this problem, this project is expanding the
              curriculum to provide undergraduate students with experience in
              state-of-the-art methods for the analysis, testing, and manufacture of advanced
              composite materials. This goal is being accomplished by the establishment of a
              composite materials laboratory in the college of engineering and the
              development of an associated course on the mechanics of composite materials.
              The laboratory not only serves as part of the course, but it also provides a
              resource for our students to conduct senior design and undergraduate research
              projects that are related to the manufacturing and testing of these materials.
              In addition, this effort supports a new area of emphasis in manufacturing
              engineering that is being developed in the college.   By serving as a model,
              this project is having an impact on undergraduate education in general. In
              addition, undergraduate research work in the lab is helping to further the
              state-of-the-art in predicting the behavior of composite materials.
