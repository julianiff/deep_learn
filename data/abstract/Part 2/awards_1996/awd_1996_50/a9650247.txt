Abstract    :
               The purpose of this project is to improve the Human Performance Laboratory. 
              The new equipment enables the undergraduate students to perform
              three-dimensional human gait analysis of the lower extremities.  This
              capability affects the general biomechanics course, the mechanics of human
              locomotion course, and the independent research projects for undergraduate
              students.   The equipment includes a bilateral gait analysis computer program,
              an analog sampling system, and a force platform.  This equipment interfaces
              with an existing four-camera computerized video analysis system and a force
              platform. The entire system enables students to perform a complete description
              of the movement and forces of both lower extremities during one full stride of
              walking, running, and other forms of locomotion.  The need to examine both
              lower extremities is clearly evident when examining patients with abnormal
              asymmetrical gait.  With this system, the Human Performance Laboratory can be
              prepared for clinical gait analysis of patients referred from orthopedic
              surgeons.  This would be an excellent subject pool for projects resulting in
              professional presentations and publications by undergraduate students.   The
              new equipment is significantly improving the training of students in the
              mechanics of the gait cycle and is serving as a model to other schools
              interested in developing gait analysis for undergraduate students.
