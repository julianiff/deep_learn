Abstract    :
               This project introduces physiology students to investigative learning by
              engaging them in experimental projects that use computer-based instruments to
              solve problems that they pose about animal systems. In the introductory
              physiology and neurophysiology courses for majors, and in the introductory
              physiology course for nonmajors, students use an array of computer-interfaced
              transducers and electrodes to measure and analyze a variety of physiological
              processes, ranging from action potentials to brain waves. Consulting closely
              with the instructor, students in collaborative teams use computer-based guides
              to set up and work through the phases of a focused study in physiology. These
              include searching the literature on-line and in the lab library, posing
              questions, learning the rudiments of experimental design, logging hardware,
              reducing and depicting results in graphic formats, performing appropriate
              statistical tests, and developing reasoned conclusions in oral and written
              form. This laboratory project enables students to raise original questions
              about physiological systems and to acquire some of the problem-solving
              strategies and skills needed to answer them. As a result of these experiences,
              students not only gain a practical and intimate appreciation of the dynamics of
              physiological processes but also acquire computational skills for pursuing new
              problems they will encounter in other venues, such as honors projects, graduate
              studies, and professional employment.
