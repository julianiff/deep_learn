Abstract    :
               The purpose of this project is to establish a mathematics technology laboratory
              in which to teach and develop curricula for two newly designed and required
              courses in the preservice middle school and elementary education majors. The
              two courses, Foundations of Probability and Statistics for Teachers and
              Foundations of Geometry for Teachers, are expected to serve 300 students each
              year and are undergoing major curriculum development for technology-based
              laboratory experiences.   The technology laboratory is being equipped with
              Power Macintosh 8500 multimedia computers, together with appropriate software
              and Internet access, for student use. The laboratory also contains the new
              TI-92 graphing and symbolic algebra calculators, together with Calculator Based
              Laboratory units, for `real` data collection and display. This state-of-the-art
              technology offers opportunities for future teachers to experience learning
              mathematics through cooperative problem solving on-line, collection and
              simulation of real data, visualization and exploration of geometric and
              algebraic patterns, and communication of concepts and strategies through
              written and verbal processes. Since research indicates that people teach as
              they were taught, it is expected that these mathematics experiences will
              influence methodology used in their own classrooms. The technology also offers
              opportunities for instructors of these courses to create new and revise
              existing mathematics curricula to reflect student responses to laboratory
              activities.   Dissemination efforts can proceed through the mathematics
              experiences of these students and through presentations at conferences and
              publications. Evaluation plans include concurrent assessment of curricula,
              student attitudes, and student mathematical progress as the technology
              laboratory is used, together with informal interactions with student teachers
              and their cooperating teachers.
