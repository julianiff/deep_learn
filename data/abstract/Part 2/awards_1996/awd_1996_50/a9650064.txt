Abstract    :
              The main goal of this project is to improve instruction in Organic Chemistry,
              Environmental Chemistry, and Analytical Chemistry by adding gas
              chromatography-mass spectrometry instrumentation to the laboratory component of
              these courses.  Specifically, the new system enables students to acquire mass
              spectral information on compounds and mixtures they are using in the laboratory
              rather than merely to learn about mass spectrometry from text and computer
              exercises.  In addition to its uses in Organic Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry,
              and Environmental Chemistry courses, it also is being used for introductory
              experiences in freshman level courses for majors as well as non-majors. The
              automation included in the instrument speeds data collection and makes it
              possible for students to gain valuable experience in computer searching of
              spectral data bases using mass spectral data for identification as well as
              using the spectral interpretation tools to assist in determining the structure
              of an unknown compound.  In addition, the instrumentation is being used in a
              student-manned environmental analysis laboratory that is supporting courses in
              a new environmental science program and facility.
