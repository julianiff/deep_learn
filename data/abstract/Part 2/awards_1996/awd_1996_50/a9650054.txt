Abstract    :
               This project is expanding the laboratory component of an introductory physical
              science course for "non-science" majors, including education majors.  It
              creates a laboratory that allows "non-science" majors to experience hands-on
              the methods and purposes of physical science.  The project is providing
              instruments for computer acquisition, graphing, and analysis of experimental
              data and for computer acquisition and analysis of video recordings of
              experiments.  It also allows students to spend more time planning, executing,
              and reporting an independent investigation of a self-selected topic in physical
              science.  The project is allowing more students to graduate from college with
              an understanding, based on personal experience, of the methods and purposes of
              physical science.
