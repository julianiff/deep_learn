Abstract    :
               This project is arranging the purchase of a 300-MHz multinuclear nuclear
              magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This instrument is being used to upgrade
              the educational program in organic chemistry, analytical chemistry,
              biochemistry, and spectroscopy. Specific experiments and activities can be
              performed by the students to increase their knowledge in these fields, as well
              as to give them experience with modern NMR techniques. This instrument is also
              being heavily used in our strong undergraduate research program. Five faculty
              have needs that require a higher-field multinuclear NMR that cannot be met by
              the current instrument, so instead they are forced to send samples out to
              former colleagues and current collaborators. This slows down the pace of
              research for the students and the faculty and does not enable undergraduate
              student co-workers to gain experience with the type of instrument they will use
              in industry or in graduate school.    One of the educational results of this
              instrument may be the development of new experiments to be published in
              journals such as the Journal of Chemical Education and presented at
              professional meetings of the American Chemical Society and the Missouri Academy
              of Science. The instrument can also be demonstrated to high school students and
              teachers and made available to them for advanced projects, if needed.
