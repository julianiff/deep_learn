Abstract    :
               Inexpensive, good grade charge-coupled-device (CCD) chips and associated
              cameras and telescopes, with accurate field acquisition hardware and software,
              slow motion controls, autoguiders, precision drives, and PC-based software for
              calibrating observations, are now available off-the-shelf. This development has
              astounding implications for the undergraduate astronomy program. Now,
              user-friendly software and systems make it possible for students to acquire,
              reduce, analyze, and interpret precision, real-time astronomical data in their
              introductory astronomy laboratory. For the advanced student, this can form the
              basis for their own undergraduate research project. It provides the general
              education student with an opportunity for hands-on experience with a primarily
              observational science. Precollege teachers, with this experience, bring a
              natural excitement for science to their classrooms. New, stimulating
              observational labs enable students to interpret lunar topography, measure
              changing planetary features, and study the light variation of individual stars,
              eclipsing binaries, image clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Archiving of data
              will allow for longer range studies not possible in one night's session, and
              indoor laboratories can be used in the case of inclement weather. Thus, in this
              project, the department plans to implement the CCD into an already popular
              introductory Astronomy lab, the new Program for Student Learning, and the
              undergraduate research program.
