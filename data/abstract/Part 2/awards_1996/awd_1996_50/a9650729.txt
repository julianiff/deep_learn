Abstract    :
               The Department of Physics places a high value on undergraduate laboratory
              experiences. In recent years, the Department of Physics and College of Science
              have made strong commitments to expanding the upper-division laboratory
              courses. One of the most recent additions to the laboratory course offerings is
              the Lasers and Modern Optics course, which features both lecture and laboratory
              components. The Lasers and Modern Optics course introduces students to some of
              the many optical concepts beyond the simple ray optics and diffraction theory
              found in most introductory physics courses.   With this project, the authors
              seek to enhance the Lasers and Modern Optics course by providing modern
              equipment for the students. Because lasers and modern optical techniques are
              now found in everyday life, as well as many research areas, this course appeals
              to a wide variety of students. Students experienced with lasers and modern
              optical techniques have an employment advantage as they begin careers in a
              world that is increasing in technological sophistication.    The purpose of the
              project is to improve present experiments and add several advanced experiments.
              The new experiments can elucidate several principles involving nonlinear
              optics, acousto-optics, electro-optics, liquid crystals, atomic resonance
              excitation, and laser stabilization.
