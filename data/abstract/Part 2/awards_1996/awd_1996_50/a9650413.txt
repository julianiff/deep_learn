Abstract    :
               The goal of this project is two-fold:  (1) to develop software that may be
              implemented in a variety of computing environments to visualize algorithms and
              then (2) to incorporate the use of that software into laboratory exercises in
              courses throughout the computer science curriculum. The former goal was
              achieved largely during the summer of 1988, with refinements to the system
              occurring in the summer of 1989. Working with students Pamela J. Krussel and
              Christopher D. Hundhausen, project principal investigator Dr. Thomas L. Naps
              developed the GAIGS (Generalized Algorithm Illustration through Graphical
              Software) algorithm visualization system. This software runs on the local area
              VAX cluster which is the hub of the computer science laboratory. The software
              presents graphical animations of algorithms on VAXStation 2000s. The animation
              is generated by a program that implements that algorithm on any of the computer
              systems on campus.
