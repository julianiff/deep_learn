Abstract    :
              The primary objective of this proposal is to incorporate modern cell imaging
              techniques into an advanced cell biology course. Students enrolled in this
              course are preparing for professional careers, with immediate preparation for
              graduate school. The imaging capabilities of this proposal will allow those
              students to complete projects using appropriate visual presentations and with
              complete digital analysis of the images collected. A secondary objective is to
              accumulate educational images that can be added to the world wide web site for
              cell biology located at Gustavus Adolphus College. This collection will
              significantly add to the images available for undergraduate education
              throughout the United States and abroad.
