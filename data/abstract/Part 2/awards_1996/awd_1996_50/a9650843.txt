Abstract    :
              This project provides funds to create computer-microscopy stations to better
              implement a BioQUEST PPP philosophy in the introductory biology, genetics, and
              microbiology courses.  As a result,  more hands-on experience are being
              introduced into the undergraduate curriculum,  most of the courses are
              undergoing a series of changes, and most courses now have laboratories. Some 
              courses have "research-like" experiences, and a few  include a comprehensive
              PPP-like research experience.  A student defines a question (poses a problem),
              conceives and executes an experiment (solves a problem), and thinks carefully 
              about the data and its relevance to the question to convince  colleagues
              (persuades peers). This technology also improves the instructor's ability to
              create open-ended, student-originated research problems.
