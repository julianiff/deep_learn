Abstract    :
              This project has enhanced the teaching of undergraduate biochemistry by  
              improving the diversity and scope of lab exercises and independent study  class
              experiments performed. Specifically, new equipment  allows the replacement of
              commercial samples with biomolecules extracted by students from biological
              samples. Also, students are able to store unstable samples between lab periods,
              and from one year to the next. Classical biochemistry experiments are still
              being conducted, but  new laboratory exercises now include the isolation,
              purification, analysis, and quantitation of biological samples and biomolecules
              of interest to undergraduates. The implementation of this project directly
              affects 45 students per year in biochemistry laboratory, other science majors,
              and 5 to 10 undergraduates each year through specific independent study
              research projects.
