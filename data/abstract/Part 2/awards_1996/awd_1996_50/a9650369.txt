Abstract    :
               The problem addressed by this project is that many students do not have an
              opportunity to conduct sophisticated ecological research when they are juniors
              and seniors. The solution to this problem is to develop a program in modern
              ecology at the upper-division level emphasizing molecular approaches to
              investigating ecological questions. Students participating in this project are
              taking a new course in molecular ecology and are conducting substantive
              independent research in this area. They are using the techniques of molecular
              biology to answer questions about the role of genetic heterozygosity in
              metabolic adaptations, the role of heat shock proteins in the seasonal
              acclimatization of fish, the role of paternity in population biology of frogs,
              and various other ecological issues.   This program includes a component
              designed to increase the number of women and minorities in ecology. By working
              directly with the Philadelphia High School Academies, the principal
              investigator is recruiting additional women and minorities.   Upon completion
              of this program undergraduates will be conducting molecular ecology research at
              an advanced level.
