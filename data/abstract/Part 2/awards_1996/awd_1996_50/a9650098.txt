Abstract    :
              This project will develop a computerized mapping facility  for use by
              undergraduate students.  For geology students to be competitive in the job
              market or in applications to graduate school, they must be computer literate.
              Formal coursework in computer basics is not sufficient. Students must be
              exposed to extensive practical, hands-on, experience to increase their
              expertise and to facilitate their transition from a student to a professional
              setting. The use of computers and Global Positioning System (GPS) mapping in
              the context of geology field camp provides an ideal opportunity for students to
              apply their computer knowledge in an environment that closely approximates that
              of the job market. This project applies computer and GPS technology to
              stratigraphic analysis (the preparation of columnar sections and cross
              sections), structural geology problems (rose diagrams, stereo nets, cross
              sections), map problems (location of data points and the transfer of
              information from field observations to finished maps), plotting, and report
              writing. The equipment used in this project can also be used in other
              departmental courses. The basic thrust of this enhancement is the shift from
              hand drawn to computer graphics and acquisition of GPS mapping techniques.
