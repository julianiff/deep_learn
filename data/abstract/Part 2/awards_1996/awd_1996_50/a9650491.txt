Abstract    :
               The Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering is purchasing equipment
              to develop an undergraduate process safety laboratory. Specifically, this
              project supports the purchase of:  a mini flash-point tester, a flammability
              testing apparatus, corrosion studies equipment, a reactive system screening
              tool, vent sizing software, and supporting accessories. These items can be used
              in laboratory experiments that expand upon and supplement the required process
              safety course. This process safety course and the laboratory are providing a
              model for developing similar courses and laboratories in other chemical
              engineering programs and therefore may contribute to what should be the
              ultimate goal of having process safety a required component of all chemical
              engineering curricula in the United States. The results can be disseminated
              through articles published in the SACHE newsletter and Chemical Engineering
              Education, both of which now enjoy a wide readership among Chemical Engineering
              faculty.
