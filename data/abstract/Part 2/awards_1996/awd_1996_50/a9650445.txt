Abstract    :
              The project's focus is the setup of a computer-controlled system for performing
              electrical and optical measurements on solar cells and thin films. The system
              is being used for student research and for performing three new experiments to
              be included in the upper-level, intermediate, and advanced laboratory courses,
              required for all physics majors. Previously, these courses have suffered from a
              lack of modern instruments and computer-controlled experiments, too little
              emphasis on applications relevant to students who do not plan further study in
              physics, and a lack of optical experiments. The new experiments are designed to
              introduce students to the use of computers for instrument control and data
              acquisition and to measurement techniques, instrumentation, and physical
              phenomena to which they are not currently exposed in these courses.    The
              three experiments involve the measurement and analysis of solar cell
              current-voltage characteristics under simulated solar illumination; solar cell
              quantum efficiency as a function of wavelength; and optical properties of thin
              films. The lab materials developed for this project will be made available to
              others over the Internet and descriptions of the experiments will be submitted
              for publication in a professional journal.
