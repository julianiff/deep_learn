Abstract    :
               This institution has a strong interdisciplinary undergraduate Cartography and
              Map Technology Program that is nationally recognized. The objective of this
              project is to obtain the necessary resources to pedagogically improve the
              cartography program by implementing an integrative approach of study involving
              several key cartography and geography courses. Students can benefit from this
              approach by learning the discipline holistically in completing major mapping
              and research projects that have a common theme. These IGIS projects would
              result primarily from multicourse exercises that are more meaningful and
              sophisticated in terms of method because they extend over a 2-year period. For
              this integrative approach to properly executed in the cartography program, the
              following equipment and software are being purchased:  15 Pentium PCs, 15
              upgrades to l7` color monitors, and 2 additional Digital Video Plotter
              licenses.   Three key courses that require these resources to implement the
              integrative approach are Remote Sensing, Photogrammetry, and a revised course
              to be named Applied Digital Image and/or Photogrammetric Analysis. Project data
              generated primarily by image processing and softcopy photogrammetry can be
              utilized by these same students in ensuing cartography and geography courses.
              Because each major project links various key courses to IGIS exercises, this
              integrative approach enables students to gain insight into professional mapping
              practices and sophisticated research designs that require lengthy periods of
              time to complete.
