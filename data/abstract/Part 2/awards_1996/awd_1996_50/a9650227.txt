Abstract    :
               The department is acquiring an environmentally and technologically advanced
              refrigeration cycle training system for use in the marine refrigeration
              laboratory. In addition to currently being an environmental requirement, the
              added data acquisition monitoring capability of such a unit expands its use for
              the courses offered in thermodynamics and the thermal/fluids laboratories. The
              refrigeration laboratory has responded to the challenge of introducing new
              refrigeration technology into its curriculum with the phase-out of
              chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) refrigerant K-12 and the introduction of refrigerant
              recovery in laboratory exercises beginning in the Fall of 1992. Since this
              initial change-out of refrigerant and the introduction of recovery, five new
              self-contained 7,000-btu/hr Marine Air System digital control reverse cycle air
              conditioners have been added to the laboratory. Through the proposed addition
              of a refrigeration cycle training system, which includes an environmentally
              acceptable refrigerant and data acquisition monitoring capability, the final
              phase for the advancement of technology in the refrigeration laboratory would
              be complete.
