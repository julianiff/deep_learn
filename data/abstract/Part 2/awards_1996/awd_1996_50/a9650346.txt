Abstract    :
               The objective of the project is to enhance understanding of geographic
              phenomena through scientific visualization and geographic information systems
              (GIS) technology. These tools enable students to effectively see the spatial
              and temporal characteristics of geographic data. Exercises can be conducted
              within four areas of emphasis:  computer cartography and GIS, urban and
              regional planning, statistical analysis, and earth science. Lab exercises
              emphasize scientific computing, reasoning, and critical thinking. Fifteen
              undergraduate courses enrolling approximately 2,045 students are affected by
              the project each academic year. Participants consist of geography majors and
              nonmajors, including elementary and secondary education majors. In the summer,
              the facility is being used for short courses designed for K-12 teachers in the
              Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.   Previously, the department has had a facility
              for upper-level (junior and senior) courses that has been equipped with 10
              personal computers (PC's) and a SPARC20 workstation/fileserver. The laboratory
              enhancement includes 5 PCs and hardware upgrades to the workstation to
              accommodate the needs of the upper-level classes, 10 PCs for the lower-level
              (freshman and sophomore) introductory laboratory science courses, and SPYGLASS
              data visualization software for analyzing the three-dimensional and temporal
              characteristics of geographic data. Site licenses have been acquired for
              ARC/INFO, ER-MAPPER, and ATLAS*GIS, all of which contribute software support to
              the project.   Vehicles for project dissemination include providing access to
              exercises and supporting data over the Internet.
