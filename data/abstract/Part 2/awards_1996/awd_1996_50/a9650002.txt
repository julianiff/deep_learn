Abstract    :
               This university serves the predominantly Hispanic population of northern New
              Mexico.  Many of the students attending the institution have not, for whatever
              reason, not had the opportunity to develop their skills of abstraction.  It is
              difficult then for them to be successful and self-confident in the study of
              disciplines such as Computer Science. This project seeks to address the issue
              of how to teach the abstract concepts found in upper-division Computer Science
              courses to such a student population. The basic assumption of the project is
              that the abstractions of Computer Science can be better taught to such students
              through concrete demonstrations and hands-on experimentation. The department is
              currently performing experiments and demonstrations of the new hardware and
              software to be used in the laboratory settings. The goal is to enable more
              students to graduate with a deep understanding of Computer Science.  Such
              students will make a better contribution in the workplace and are more likely
              to go on to graduate school. The lessons learned from this effort should be
              applicable to any institution with a similar student body.
