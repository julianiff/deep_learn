Abstract    :
               This project involves acquisition of a modern, user-friendly FT-NMR
              spectrometer that enables the department to integrate a progressive modern
              instrumentation training program into the curriculum. Undergraduates are being
              introduced to NMR in organic chemistry. They gain expertise in sophisticated
              techniques in their junior and senior years. The project incorporates 16 new or
              improved NMR experiments throughout the organic, physical, analytical, and
              inorganic courses. It has allowed creation of a new course, Advanced Practical
              Organic Spectroscopy.   The FT-NMR spectrometer also has a positive impact on
              undergraduate research programs, as all chemistry majors are required to work
              with faculty mentors on original research projects during their junior and
              senior years.
