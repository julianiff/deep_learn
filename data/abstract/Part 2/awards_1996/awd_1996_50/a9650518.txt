Abstract    :
               This project supports the department's use of a Nd:YAG-pumped dye laser and the
              associated electronics equipment in the undergraduate chemistry program.
              Incorporation of a pulsed, tunable laser into the teaching and research
              laboratories reflects contemporary research activities in physical and
              inorganic chemistry. The new instrumentation has a major impact on the
              upper-division teaching and laboratory courses. Beginning with the spectroscopy
              laboratory of the physical chemistry sequence, students learn the basics of
              lasing and tuning, collecting signals, data acquisition, and
              instrument-to-computer interfacing. They then apply this know-how to collecting
              the absorption spectra of Neon and Argon. Building on this experiment, students
              measure and assign the one- and two-photon absorption spectra of phenanthrene.
              In the senior-level inorganic laboratory, students use the equipment to
              investigate the long-range electron-transfer kinetics through metalloproteins.
              Here, they learn the fundamentals of transient absorption and emission
              spectroscopy. Additionally, the laser system may be used extensively in two
              undergraduate research laboratories, one that focuses on inorganic
              photochemistry and the other, on materials research.
