Abstract    :
               The university's Department of Chemistry has recently converted the organic
              laboratory to the microscale, purchased an FT-NMR, added a laboratory-based
              polymer chemistry course to the curriculum, and purchased some analytical
              instrumentation.   Through the project, the university is obtaining a
              supercritical fluid extraction unit and a capillary electrophoresis system. The
              instrumentation serves alongside existing gas and liquid chromatography
              equipment as the instructional basis for a newly offered separations course. In
              addition, this equipment enables several students in other courses to gain a
              working knowledge of a wide range of chromatographic techniques.
