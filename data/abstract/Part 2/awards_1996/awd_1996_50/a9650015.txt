Abstract    :
               The establishment of a diverse and high quality education for undergraduate
              chemistry students, and students in related fields, is a primary goal of the
              Department of Chemistry. Chemistry's being primarily an experimental science,
              one of its most important components is the undergraduate laboratories. The
              purpose of this project is to introduce into the laboratory courses in physical
              chemistry experiments that probe condensed phases at the microscopic level and,
              at the same time, continue the laboratory upgrading by introducing modern
              spectroscopic methods. Specifically, the aims of the project are to create five
              new spectroscopic experiments based on scanning tunneling microscopy and
              Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy instrument packages that are within the
              reach of most educational institutions; to develop these experiments to the
              point that they can be adopted by instructors who do not have the prior
              expertise using these techniques; to expose students in the introductory and
              advanced physical chemistry laboratories to modern techniques in physical
              chemistry as applied to diverse systems; and to communicate the results of this
              project both regionally and nationally through presentations at scientific
              meetings and publication in the Journal of Chemical Education.   The
              improvements and diversification in the physical chemistry curriculum can be
              expected to encourage more students to pursue graduate studies in chemistry.
