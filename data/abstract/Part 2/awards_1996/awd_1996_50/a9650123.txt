Abstract    :
               The Physics Department is undergoing a major improvement of its Modern Physics
              Laboratory Course. This course is a student's first exposure to independent
              experimental work, and gives students the initial tools and experiences
              necessary to competently execute future independent work, including honors
              projects, summer internships at National Labs, and technology jobs in the
              industrial sector.   Improvement of the lab can be realized by the development
              of four permanent computer stations for the measurement, control, and analysis
              of nonlinear systems. A sequence of four new modern physics experiments is
              being developed (bouncing ball, string vibrations, double scroll circuit, and
              capillary ripples) to provide students with an experimental knowledge of the
              rudiments of low-dimensional, nonlinear time-series analysis (also known as
              chaos theory), as well as the rudiments (at the level of the quadratic map) of
              the theory of nonlinear systems. Participants are developing a nonlinear signal
              analyzer using LabViewlHiQ, which assists students in their exploration of
              experimental nonlinear systems. This nonlinear signal analyzer can be
              distributed over the Internet to other students and instructors wishing to
              build on this project.    The hope is that students_enchanted by both the
              complexity and comprehensibility of these everyday nonlinear phenomena
              (bouncing balls, strings, and ripples)_will want to pursue additional
              scientific studies of their own based on the confidence and competence
              resulting from these labs.
