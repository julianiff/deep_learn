Abstract    :
               The Department of Statistics is committed to the utilization of appropriate
              technology to increase the learning experience of students. The present
              initiative is aimed toward the Statistics 100 (STAT100) course, a general
              education course. The primary goal of STAT100 is to enhance students'
              capabilities as intelligent consumers of quantitative information. The
              essential concepts of statistics are emphasized rather than a variety of
              statistical techniques. The students tend to be bright but not technologically
              oriented, coming from more than 100 different majors. Most are freshmen or
              sophomores, and about two-thirds are women. The enrollment has grown rapidly in
              the past several years and is currently at about 400 students per semester.  
              For several years, an innovative and extremely easy-to-use computer program,
              developed in the department, has been used in one-fourth to one-half of the
              classes to increase students' hands-on involvement with statistical data and
              with statistical and probabilistic experiments. This project makes possible
              on-line communication between students and the instructor, and among students
              themselves, and provides opportunities for on-line assignments, quizzes,
              projects, etc.   In order to bring the advantages of the statistical and
              conferencing software to all of the sections of STAT100, the department is
              enhancing its undergraduate computer laboratory. Previously, there have been
              only eight computers that could be utilized for this project, four of which are
              only marginally effective. Through this latest enhancement, the number of
              useful PCs is being increased to 25.
