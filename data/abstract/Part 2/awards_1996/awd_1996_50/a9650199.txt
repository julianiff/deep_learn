Abstract    :
              This proposed project seeks to integrate Computer-Integrated Manufacturing (CIM)
              technology into curriculum that is introductory in nature for the Manufacturing
              Technology student. Objectives are:  1. Upgrade the existing Production
              Laboratory to reflect the current state of automation processes in
              manufacturing.   2. Integrate manufacturing automation processes into the
              Technology Education (pre-service teachers), General Industry & Technology and
              Manufacturing Technology concentrations where CIM is part of the elective
              curricula rather than a requirement.   3. Improve the quality of undergraduate
              student research in manufacturing automation, materials testing, CAD/CAM,
              technology education and industrial technology through full-size machine tool
              technology.      By purchasing an electronic engine lathe, retrofitting an
              existing vertical mill and purchasing a new CNC controller for an existing NC
              lathe, the Production Lab will have the capability to introduce fundamental CIM
              technology to students in Manufacturing Technology concentrations, Technology
              Education, and General Industry & Technology in entry level courses.      The
              proposed project will upgrade existing laboratory facilities to include CIM
              technology with full-sized machine tools. Currently, students have access to
              CIM technology through table-top machines in elective courses. The project will
              facilitate the introduction of CIM concepts earlier in the curriculum, improve
              laboratory experience for pre-service technology teachers, be available for
              student research projects requiring full-size equipment and open an avenue for
              independent study requiring CNC lathe and mill projects.
