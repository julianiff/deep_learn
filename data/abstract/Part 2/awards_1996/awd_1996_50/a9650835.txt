Abstract    :
               The Biology Department has developed an array of innovative courses that
              emphasize a hands-on approach to experimental biology. These investigative
              biology courses are targeted to both biology majors and nonmajors and affect a
              significant number of prospective teachers. This project provides funds to
              technologically upgrade the investigative course laboratories with computer
              equipment and software. This enhancement improves the ability of future
              scientists and educators to understand how to apply computer technology to
              scientific endeavors. The primary goal of the project is to improve the
              understanding of science and computer literacy by teaching students to use
              computers and computer networks as tools for scientific investigations.
