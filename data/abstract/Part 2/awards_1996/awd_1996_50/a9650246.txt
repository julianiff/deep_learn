Abstract    :
               The national attrition rates in first-year calculus courses continue to be very
              high. This problem is exacerbated by the declining skills of high school
              graduates in algebraic manipulation and trigonometry.   The use of small
              classes (30-35 students) makes it possible to assess individual needs better
              and respond accordingly. The introduction of technology in many of these
              classes further provides students with support mechanisms for their limited
              skills in algebra and trigonometry. The ease in graphing and the use of
              computer algebra systems encourages students to address many of their own
              questions.   Entering students, in most cases, have a considerable familiarity
              with the use of computers and have grown up with computer games and their
              interactive approach to `problem solving.` This project harnesses that approach
              by extending the present symbolic algebra system capabilities to a broader use
              of multimedia in the classroom and the student laboratories. The incorporation
              of sound, video, and animation can provide a richer, more dynamic learning
              environment for students. To this end educational authoring softwares,
              Authorware and Director, are being used to create interactive multimedia
              presentations illustrating many of the major concepts of calculus and
              differential equations for classroom demonstration and as introductions to each
              of the laboratory projects involving Mathematica. This will substantially
              enhance the Mathematica laboratory projects that have been developed over the
              past 6 years.
