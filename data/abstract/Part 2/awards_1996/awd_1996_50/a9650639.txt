Abstract    :
              The primary objective of this project is to provide funding for equipment to
              update molecular biology laboratory courses. The proposed project  is also
              expected to improve other courses using molecular-based techniques, the ability
              to introduce molecular-based concepts and experimentation to biology majors and
              nonmajors, and the training of future elementary science teachers.  Pedagogic
              issues addressed by the updated laboratory courses include learning essential
              techniques of molecular biology, introducing the scientific method of doing
              research,  and learning how to write scientifically and effectively.  In
              particular, students will be introduced to important molecular techniques, such
              as preparing recombinant DNA plasmids, DNA analysis using polymerase chain
              reaction (PCR)-based techniques and sequencing, and  analyses of protein
              expression. Other innovative aspects of the project include an emphasis on a
              research-like laboratory experience and an increased use of computers to
              enhance learning. The use of this equipment is also being integrated into a new
              Education/Natural Science major that utilizes novel, inquiry-based techniques
              to train the next generation of elementary science teachers.
