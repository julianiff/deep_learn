Abstract    :
               Pasteurization is a cost-effective means of reducing bacterial populations in a
              variety of materials and has been applied in the food industry, biotechnology,
              and wastewater treatment. One of the major advances in pasteurization has been
              the development of inline pasteurization units which enable industries to
              continuously treat a liquid. With any procedure and its associated equipment,
              responsible individuals must understand the process and be able to modify
              procedures as conditions change. This ability to think through problems
              associated with a process critically is difficult to teach without a hands-on
              opportunity to use the equipment. The newly acquired equipment, a benchtop
              pasteurizer with data logging capacity, duplicates industrial processes and
              permits students to design and conduct experiments that address the complex
              issues related to the pasteurization process. To accomplish this, students in
              the Food, Dairy, and Industrial Microbiology course are assigned a problem to
              solve that relates to pasteurization. The solution requires that the students
              define the parameters to examine, conduct experiments on the pasteurizer to
              evaluate possible solutions, assess the data collected, and determine the best
              solution to their problem.
