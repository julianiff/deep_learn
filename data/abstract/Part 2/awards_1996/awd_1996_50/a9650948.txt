Abstract    :
              The equipment requested will be used to support revision in quantitative and
              instrumental analysis for chemistry courses leading to certificates and
              associate degrees in Environmental Technology and also for students
              transferring to four-year institutions.  The addition of atomic absorption
              spectrometry and UV-visible spectrometry close the gap between Brookhaven
              College's current instrumentation and instruments found in modern industrial
              laboratories.  The new instruments will better prepare students for typical,
              work-related tasks in environmental sampling and measurements.  The
              instrumentation will be used in both analytical and general chemistry courses.
