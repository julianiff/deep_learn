Abstract    :
               Nationally, students typically do not improve in conceptual understanding of
              basic physics principles under traditional instructional techniques. The
              primary goal of this project is to provide a means for students to improve
              their learning, retention, and utilization of physics concepts and principles.
              This goal is being accomplished through the use of computers and
              microcomputer-based laboratories. These laboratories (from Tools for Scientific
              Thinking, Workshop Physics, and others that are being prepared in-house) in
              kinematics, forces, rotational motion, energy, heat, and light use probes and
              other accessories connected to the computers to gather data. The students can
              then analyze this data and, through discovery, learn and internalize physics
              concepts. The new approach results in new learning experiences for the students
              and, according to data gathered by Thornton and Laws, improve conceptual
              understanding.   The laboratories are being equipped with the software and
              hardware for three complete workstations and one portable computer. These items
              can be used to supplement the current laboratory, which has three Power
              Macintosh 7100/72 computers and the accessory probes and interfaces. Other new
              equipment includes two laser printers, networking cables and accessories, and
              some laboratory supplies.   This project can encourage students to complete the
              physics courses at the college, to improve their science experience, and to
              expose current and future teachers to an instructional method other than the
              traditional lecture format.
