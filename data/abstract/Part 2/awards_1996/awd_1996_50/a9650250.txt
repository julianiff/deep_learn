Abstract    :
               The project involves acquisition of a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer
              (GC-MS) to provide all students hands-on experience with a central instrument
              used in industrial and graduate school research laboratories. It also involves
              development of instruction and courseware to engage students in problem solving
              and methods development.  The project is allowing students to investigate
              familiar materials, such as perfumes, and be exposed to some of the strategies
              of analysis and mass spectral interpretation. Upper-level students are also
              solving problems and developing new methods of analysis. For example, in the
              Instrumental Analysis course, students are handling real-world samples in
              complex matrices as they develop methods for analysis of mycotoxins in rice and
              corn. In biology courses, students are characterizing small protein molecules
              that have been implicated in mechanisms of resistance of plants to pathogens. 
              The project is preparing undergraduates to enter the modern-day instrumental
              laboratory competently and confidently and heightening student enthusiasm and
              interest in chemistry.
