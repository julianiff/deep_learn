Abstract    :
               The widespread availability of user-friendly computational chemistry programs
              has made molecular modeling and computational calculations routine chemical
              techniques. To expose students to this powerful technology, the project is
              integrating computational chemistry into a discovery-based curriculum. In the
              first year, students use computational chemistry to begin to get a molecular
              view of the world as they learn how energy relates to molecular structure and
              motion. In organic chemistry, students use molecular modeling in lecture class
              to understand which interactions influence chemical reactions and in laboratory
              as a routine method of analysis. In physical chemistry, students use ab initio
              methods to investigate molecular orbitals, potential energy surfaces, and
              transition states. In the 1997-98 school year, a new upper-division integrated
              laboratory sequence will commence that will allow students to use computational
              chemistry to correlate the electronic structure with the behavior of compounds
              that they will synthesize and/or study. The project includes eight Macintosh
              computers networked to an IBM RISC/6000 workstation and an LCD panel and
              overhead projector for use by the instructor. The project uses graphically
              oriented molecular modeling software, as well as additional software, and two
              printers for presenting students' results.
