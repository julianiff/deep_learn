Abstract    :
               The focus of this project is the enhancement of the laboratory experience in
              introductory, organic, and analytical chemistry through the acquisition of an
              FTIR spectrophotometer. This instrument allows rapid acquisition of spectra and
              helps students relate practical experiences to theory. The project provides
              students with FTIR instrumentation which allows them to assimilate theory and
              concepts, resulting in improved learning; provides students with experience in
              applying qualitative methods to the analysis of data, resulting in increased
              critical thinking and problem solving skills; better prepares students for
              transfer into 4-year science and engineering curricula or for entry into
              technical careers by providing a practical laboratory experience using
              spectroscopy; and provides underprepared students exposure to advanced
              analytical tools and an appreciation for "real world" chemistry by developing
              laboratory exercises that incorporate FTIR applications. The addition of FTIR
              to the laboratory, integrated with assignments in the classroom, reinforces
              concepts and provide students a more comprehensive understanding of entry-level
              and college-transfer chemistry. The approach in integrating theory and
              application encourages further exploration and practice on the part of the
              students.
