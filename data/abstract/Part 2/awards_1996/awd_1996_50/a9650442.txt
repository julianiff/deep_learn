Abstract    :
               This project concerns the purchase of an atomic absorption spectrometer, which
              has the capability of both flame and graphite furnace atomization. This
              instrument can be used in a wide variety of introductory courses, both major
              and nonmajor, as well as in upper division courses and undergraduate research.
              Because atomic absorption is such a widely accepted method, students are
              learning how modern instruments are used in analytical and environmental
              laboratories in the 1990s, including computer interfacing and control.   
              Specifically, experiments are planned for the Environmental Chemistry and
              Perspectives in Nutrition nonmajor courses; Equilibrium and Analysis and
              General Chemistry (Accelerated) Laboratory science major introductory courses;
              and the Inorganic/Physical Chemistry Lab, Instrumental Analysis, and
              student/faculty research projects in the upper-division courses.    It is
              important that both introductory and advanced students get first-hand
              experience with this instrument in order to understand the advantages and
              limitations of the atomic absorption method. The graphite furnace enables
              detection of many elements in the parts per billion to trillion range, which is
              the level of occurrence of trace metals in many environmental and biological
              samples.
