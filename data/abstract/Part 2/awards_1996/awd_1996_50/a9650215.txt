Abstract    :
              This project is designed to provide necessary equipment for a coherent, focused
              set of molecular genetics laboratory exercises for undergraduates.  In
              particular, the project allows students to learn about important principles and
              techniques in molecular biology, including  nucleic acid isolation, cloning,
              polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications, DNA sequencing, and DNA
              sequence analysis. The primary audience for this project is undergraduate
              biology majors and preservice biology/education majors. Improved laboratory
              capabilities  are expected to enhance the department's ability to attract and
              retain students in molecular biology and the biological sciences.
