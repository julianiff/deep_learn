Abstract    :
               Students choosing to major in biology at this college can choose from two
              microbiology courses, Microbiology, and Medical Microbiology. Increases in
              student enrollments in biology, along with increased student interest in
              cooperative research, have lead to pressure to expand the biology offerings.
              The decision was made to increase the depth of treatment of the topics covered
              formerly by the Medical Microbiology course by dividing it into two courses,
              Immunology and Medical Microbiology. The former course treats the host response
              to pathogenicity, while the latter surveys major bacterial, fungal, and viral
              pathogens.   The immunology course has been assembled and was offered in the
              Spring 1995 semester using borrowed equipment.  Now, with the acquisition of
              new equipment, the department is able to extend and improve the laboratory
              exercises.  The new equipment includes a microscope with fluorescence
              capabilities, a 96-well microplate reader, and equipment to culture,
              manipulate, and quantitate cells of the immune system.   The Biology Department
              faculty believe that majors learn best when offered the opportunity to conduct
              research as a means to enhance their classroom knowledge.  The equipment
              obtained can also be used in faculty-directed student independent research.
