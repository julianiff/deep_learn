Abstract    :
               The Department of Chemistry is committed to providing undergraduate students
              with relevant, state-of-the-art laboratory instruction. The department is
              currently in the process of reforming the laboratory curricula through the
              introduction of new experiments and by extending `real world` applications of
              modern instrumentation into both upper- and lower-level undergraduate courses.
              The project involves the acquisition of a Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)
              spectrometer and the integration of its quantitative applications into the
              Analytical and Organic Chemistry curricula, as well as undergraduate research
              projects. This integration includes the general quantitative analysis
              laboratory typically taken during the second semester of the first year.   It
              is believed that the changes, facilitated by acquisition of the FTIR
              spectrometer, are increasing both the quality and scope of instruction in the
              laboratory courses and are attracting more students to the study of science,
              particularly women and under-represented minority groups. Program
              implementation gives all of the laboratory students hands-on experience with
              modern instrumentation and provides chemistry majors with skills that will
              enable them to pursue careers in science successfully.
