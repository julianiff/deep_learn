Abstract    :
               This project is intended to foster a more comprehensive knowledge of research
              methods and to infuse students with an enthusiasm for doing research. The major
              goal of this project is to enhance the undergraduate course in experimental
              psychology by expanding the number of computer workstations and supporting
              software for conducting students experiments. All laboratory workstations used
              in the project are being linked to the university network, thereby providing
              access to the distributed resources of the university library, most other state
              university libraries, the Internet, and the World Wide Web.    In addition to
              enhancing the in-laboratory information retrieval capabilities, the project is
              making much of the course information available to students and interested
              parties through the networking of the laboratory and a class website. The
              monitored laboratory is open for student use 40 hours per week. The primary
              software, MacLaboratory Psychology, is a research-grade tool that consists of a
              number of experimental modules that stimulate students to explore a variety of
              research problems in general experimental psychology using both basic and
              advanced research methods. The project also provides students with powerful
              statistical software (STATVIEW and SuperNOVA) with which to analyze the results
              of the experiments they conceive, execute, and report.
