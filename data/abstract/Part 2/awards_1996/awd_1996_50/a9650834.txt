Abstract    :
               This project introduces modern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
              into the undergraduate curriculum. The new Fourier-transform-NMR instrument is
              being integrated into several upper-level courses for chemistry majors and
              minors. In the instrumental analysis laboratory course, a new experiment has
              been planned to introduce students to the concepts and techniques of FT-NMR.
              Among the techniques included are homonuclear decoupling, gated decoupling and
              spin lattice relaxation time measurement by the inversion recovery method. In
              the organic chemistry laboratory course, the use of NMR is greatly increased,
              and modern methods are introduced. In the advanced physical chemistry
              laboratory course, an NMR component is being added as a second method of
              analysis for an experiment currently in the curriculum.   The instrument can
              also be used as part of an ongoing series of workshops that introduce
              analytical methods to high school teachers and students.
