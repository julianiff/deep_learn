Abstract    :
               The project is intended to improve the teaching and understanding of human
              movement in undergraduate exercise science and physical education courses and
              the quality of independent and advanced studies. The project provides funds to
              assist in purchasing a Force Platform System.  The Force Platform System
              provides for qualitative and quantitative kinetic analysis of human movement
              and for graphical data to be superimposed on video images of human performance.
               Course instruction is enhanced by the system since mechanical principles are
              presented graphically in relation to skill acquisition, injury mechanisms, and
              abnormal movement patterns.  Future teachers, exercise specialists, and health
              care professionals can benefit from course enhancement. The Force Platform
              System complements an updated Video Analysis System (Peak Performance)
              currently housed in the Human Performance Laboratory. Students are able to
              conduct independent projects quantifying both kinematic (movement patterns) and
              kinetic (forces affecting movement) components of human performance. The
              principal investigator has been actively involved in using and upgrading her
              expertise in both regular duties and special sabbatical leave projects. The
              university's location and local community involvement provide for numerous
              outreach opportunities.
