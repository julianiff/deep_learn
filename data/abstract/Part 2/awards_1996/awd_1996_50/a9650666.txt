Abstract    :
               This project is designed to improve the college's general and organic chemistry
              instruction through the revision of the chemistry laboratories. The goal of a
              laboratory is to enable students to learn about science by doing science. The
              college is improving the student learning experience by enhancing the student
              laboratory experience in three ways. First, student confidence in data
              acquisition is being heightened in the laboratory through the use of
              calculator-based laboratory systems. These portable systems streamline the data
              collection process, increasing student confidence in the laboratory. Second,
              the same system improves student learning and comprehension through efficient,
              meaningful data analysis. Third, discovery-based laboratory experiments in
              organic chemistry are being designed to develop critical thinking skills to
              encourage students to predict reactions and to interpret the results of the
              experiments, rather than simply to confirm predicted outcomes.
