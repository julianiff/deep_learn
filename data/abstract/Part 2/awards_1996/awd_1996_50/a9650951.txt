Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to improve course content in chemistry
              laboratories at Rancho Santiago College, with emphasis on Organic Chemistry and
              Quantitative Analysis. Implementation would involve purchase of four modern gas
              chromatographs (GC), one modern ultraviolet-visible recording spectrophotometer
              (UV-VIS), and eight pH meters. Students will have direct hands-on experience
              with these instruments and acquire skill in interpreting the measurements they
              provide. New student exercises will be implemented which take advantage of the
              increased capabilities of the new equipment. UV-VIS will be used for molecular
              structure determination and allow enhanced knowledge of structure/property
              interrelationships. GC is a valuable adjunct to these methods because it allows
              rapid separation, identification, and quantification of volatile substances.
              Information obtained from pH meters are useful in the determination of the
              percent of a substance in an unknown, helping to identify an unknown, and
              determining the dissociation constant of a weak acid. Students in General
              Chemistry will also benefit from this new instrumentation.
