Abstract    :
              This project includes a computer-based laboratory designed to give students more
              control over experiments and research in physiology. The laboratory uses
              computers and analog-to-digital converters to record data. Using current 
              software, instructors also create custom, user-friendly interfaces for
              controlling data acquisition and analysis. This frees them from the
              inflexibility of "canned" programs while still providing the simplicity to make
              experimentation accessible to students. Using these interfaces, students have
              more control over the methods of data collection and analysis. The first half
              of the semester involves guided experimentation. Students are introduced to the
              techniques used in physiological investigation and given practice making
              decisions about data acquisition and analysis. The second half of the semester
              involves two independent projects. Small groups of students develop their own
              hypotheses, devise controlled experiments, and analyze the results. They then
              present their results to the class in the form of a short seminar and a written
              scientific report.
