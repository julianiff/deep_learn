Abstract    :
               This project addresses a need for graduates with an ecosystem/landscape
              perspective who can integrate data from a variety of sources when addressing
              environmental issues that cut across the boundaries of traditional disciplines.
              Many such problems can be best defined hierarchically within the context of
              watersheds. The project incorporates a watershed theme into selected courses in
              biology, geology, environmental chemistry, and environmental science. Field and
              laboratory activities in these courses are directed at local drainages and may
              provide a basis for subsequent independent undergraduate research. The target
              audience is the growing number of majors in environmental science and
              environmental policy, but students in biology, chemistry, and geology also
              benefit. The department anticipates increased production of undergraduate
              publications and conference presentations, but it also expects that more of the
              student research may address real needs defined by local resource management
              agencies.
