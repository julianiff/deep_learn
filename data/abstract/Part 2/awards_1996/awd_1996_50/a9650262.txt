Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to give chemistry students laboratory and research
              experiences in modern biochemical techniques as part of a major initiative in
              biochemistry at the institution. A principal objective is the upgrading of
              instrumentation and experiments performed in the introductory biochemistry
              laboratory.  A second objective is  the improvement of physical chemistry and
              instrumental analysis. Courses are made more attractive as electives for
              students in the biochemistry track of our program by introducing experiments 
              that use biochemical systems to explore chemical principles.  Project equipment
              is also shared and by undergraduate students and faculty engaged in
              collaborative research. Overall, students receive unique experiences through
              this project and are expected publish as well as present results at scientific
              meetings.
