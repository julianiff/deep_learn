Abstract    :
              The project combines computer technology with CD-ROM capability into a
              multimedia oriented anatomy and physiology laboratory.  Experimental procedures
              are being upgraded in anatomy and physiology by incorporating computer and
              MacLab interfaces into the experimental design of the curriculum. Students work
              in groups, and conduct various exercises, including pH measurements, CO2
              production in fermentation, muscle contraction, nerve and muscle preparations,
              ECGs, blood pressure analysis, and hormonal effects on frog hearts. In addition
              to computer acquired data from interfacing with MacLab, students also utilize a
              variety of other software packages currently available.
