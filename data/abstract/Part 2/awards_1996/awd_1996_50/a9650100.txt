Abstract    :
               The goal of this project is to improve the physics laboratory experience for
              students, making it a better aid to learning the concepts of motion and energy.
              The acquisition of computers and interactive computer equipment also provides
              much needed exposure to a rapidly changing technological workplace for a very
              nontraditional student body, especially a large force of older female students.
                The improvement in equipment is being accompanied by the development of a set
              of experiments and related activities keyed to the interests of the students
              and stressing the development of critical reading and thinking skills.  
              Equipment used in the project include MBL interface probes and software,
              interactive digital video equipment, and additional computer software programs.
              The curricula targeted for the project include the motion and energy units in
              the first semester of introductory physics at all levels. Early development
              versions of experiments in kinematics, dynamics, and mechanics being performed
              by students who then provide feedback and refinements. Tested and critiqued by
              the participants, a final set of experiments with assessments ready for use in
              successive classes is produced. Materials developed can be provided to other
              introductory physics teachers through professional organizations and
              publications, along with evaluation information on the impact of the activities
              on student learning and motivation.
