Abstract    :
              This project continues and expands previous work on developing multimedia
              instruction for undergraduate electrical engineering laboratories. 
              Acquisitions have been made of some computers and ancillary equipment and
              software expand the number of laboratories where multimedia instruction can be
              employed. The development platform is placed on a movable workstation for use
              by faculty, while the notebook computers take lessons to every laboratory
              situations. This grant request also expands the impact of this work by
              targeting the Circuits Laboratory (a core course for the School of
              Engineering), supporting dissemination via CD ROM and the World-Wide Web, and
              by improving the quality of lessons that are prepared. The primary audience
              impacted is undergraduate students in laboratories and engineering faculty
              preparing multimedia instruction.
