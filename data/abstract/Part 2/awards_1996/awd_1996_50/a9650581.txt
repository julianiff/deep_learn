Abstract    :
              Modern introductory statistics courses are moving toward more emphasis on data
              analysis and the practice of statistics, with correspondingly less emphasis on
              mathematical manipulations. Within the data analysis view, however, one must
              still emphasize basic statistical concepts such as the role of randomness,
              sampling distributions, confidence and significance. Since these ideas cannot
              be explained by appealing to formal mathematics, they must be explained through
              intuitive arguments using data and simulation. Technology, then, becomes an
              essential tool for the teaching of concepts, as well as for the analysis of
              real data. Much good software and supporting material is available for the
              latter, but little attention has been paid to developing software and attendant
              material for the former.    This project will make use of the hands-on
              activities developed under the Activity-Based Statistics Project (USE-9150836)
              and the ExplorStat software developed under the project on Constructing
              Knowledge of Statistical Concepts Through Modern Technology (DUE-9354419) to
              develop, field test, and publish a series of hands-on, self-directed laboratory
              lessons for discovery-based learning of fundamental statistical concepts. It is
              anticipated that 15 to 20 lessons will be needed to adequately lead the student
              through the concepts covered in most introductory courses. For teaching
              situations in which a computer laboratory is not available, these lessons can
              serve as the basis for classroom demonstrations of these concepts.    Although
              the primary focus for the project is undergraduate statistics, these materials
              will be of use to high school teachers who are now emphasizing statistics as
              part of the mathematics curriculum, especially those who will participate in
              the new Advanced Placement Statistics program.
