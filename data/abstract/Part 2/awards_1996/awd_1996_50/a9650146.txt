Abstract    :
              This project enhances our ability to teach molecular and cellular aspects of
              biology in the following five courses currently offered in our program:
              genetics, cell biology, plant morphology and evolution, microbiology, and
              developmental biology.  Students are able to analyze cellular organelles,
              identify unknown microorganisms with greater accuracy, study antigen-antibody
              interactions in greater depth, and learn more about the molecular aspects of
              development.  Project  instrumentation also allows for new investigations into
              nuclear composition, analysis of cellular membranes, genetic fingerprinting of
              plants and animals, and exploration of the use of microorganisms in
              biotechnology. In addition, there is a significant, qualitative shift in the
              laboratory component of our major program by introducing molecular
              methodologies.
