Abstract    :
               The objective of this project is the acquisition of a Laser Doppler Velocimeter
              (LDV) and water tunnel for the newly developed Thermal Sciences Laboratory. The
              LDV serves as an instructional tool for linking material taught in the three
              foundational thermal science courses of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and
              thermodynamics and as an introduction to a state-of-the-art measurement system
              that is becoming more and more utilized in industry and academia. The addition
              of the LDV and water tunnel experiments supports a change that adds a 1-credit
              Thermal Sciences Laboratory and a 1-credit Fluid Mechanics Laboratory to the
              Mechanical Engineering curriculum.   The target audience for the project is
              undergraduate mechanical engineering students, but the project also affects
              undergraduate students in the fields of chemical and civil and environmental
              engineering. The equipment is also being used to demonstrate LDV operation and
              basic fluid/thermal phenomena to high school students in an established
              pre-engineering program at the university. The impact of the project is an
              increased student understanding of often elusive thermal science principles and
              student familiarity with an instrumentation system that could enhance the
              competitiveness of their future employers.
