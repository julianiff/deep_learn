Abstract    :
               In today's industry, rapid prototyping is an integrated part of most
              engineering design and development processes because of its cost effectiveness
              and quick production capability of complex three-dimensional physical parts
              from computer models. Currently, the Computer Aided Design (CAD) Laboratory
              hosts more than 24 486-66 PCs, 2 RISC 6000 IBMs, and 1 SUN-SPARC model 41.
              Workstations are all computer networked and fitted with solid modeling and
              finite element analysis software. This project adds a rapid prototyping system
              that is necessary to enrich students' experience with such new technology.   In
              order to manufacture competitive products, engineering and engineering
              technology students must have the technical skills and appropriate methodology
              to design products and develop applications suited for today's modern and
              competitive industrial environment. Therefore, the main objective of this
              project is to develop a rapid prototyping capability at the CAD Laboratory. The
              incorporation of such modern techniques supported by actual industrial
              applications in the CAD Laboratory can greatly enhance both the teaching and
              training activities in the Mechanical Engineering Technology Department. It is
              estimated that 700 students annually can benefit from the training and exposure
              to this new technology. In addition, the proposed equipment will be part of the
              center for technical education and distance learning that was realized through
              an ARPA-TRP Manufacturing Engineering Grant to disseminate interactive
              educational courses to local universities, community colleges, and nationwide
              audiences.   This campus is also the main hub of an educational computer
              network called `Exel-Link,` which connects most of New York state industrial
              firms and educational institutions.
