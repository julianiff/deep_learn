Abstract    :
               The chemistry department is addressing the needs of a mostly non-traditional,
              commuter student population through laboratory experience in a recently revised
              curriculum emphasizing analytical chemistry. Project INCLAN (Instrumentation
              for Chemistry via Local Area Network) provides, in introductory and
              intermediate courses, practical, instrumentation-based, hands-on
              problem-solving experiences for 60-90 science majors per year; exploration of
              technological/environmental issues for 80-100 non-science-majors through
              real-world laboratory experiments; and minimization of time/access constraints
              that severely limit effective use of four crucially useful, single-station
              techniques.   Project INCLAN features acquisition of Fourier Transform Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) and Infrared (FT-IR) spectrometric instrumentation
              for use in freshman and sophomore organic and analytical chemistry courses and
              in Natural Science courses devised for non-science-majors. The new
              instrumentation is being incorporated into a Local Area Network currently under
              construction.  Hands-on experimentation is being conducted by freshmen and
              sophomores assisted by upper-class chemistry mentors. Instrument output is
              funneled into the LAN system for student interpretation, freeing time for
              analysis of more samples during available lab periods.   The major foci for
              program assessment includes (1) level of student use of spectrometric equipment
              in affected courses, (2) fraction of real-time devoted to analysis versus
              spectrum retrieval and interpretation on networked computers, and (3) efficacy
              of the Chemistry Mentorship as beginning and intermediate students are assisted
              in acquiring and interpreting information by upper-class students. The LAN
              system is used to log levels and summarize patterns of use.   Progress during
              Project INCLAN is being communicated with colleagues by means of INTERNET
              listserv/interest group exchanges.
