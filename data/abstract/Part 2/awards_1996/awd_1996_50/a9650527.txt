Abstract    :
              This project targets three courses for advancement in educational standards
              using alternative teaching methods and integration of computer interactive
              media. Students taking general human anatomy, human physiology, and more
              advanced anatomy and physiology, use these required courses towards their
              ultimate goal of completing vocational and technological schooling. Students 
              learn by cultivating hands-on skills through finely-tuned contemporary course
              laboratory work and interaction with advanced computerized technology. New
              exercises, for example, are being introduced in pulse oximetry,  oxygen and
              hemoglobin dissociation curves, ECG and EMG studies, actual cadaver dissection,
              computer-guided and simulated dissections, and programmed histological studies.
