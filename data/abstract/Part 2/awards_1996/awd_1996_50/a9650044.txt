Abstract    :
              Training in the theory and practice of remote sensing and geographic information
              systems is becoming increasingly important in the training of environmental
              scientists for natural-resource and urban-growth management. The Remote Sensing
              and Geographic Information System for Undergraduate Training project is adding
              12 computer workstations; 1 server platform for a local network and Internet
              connection; 1 hub platform to serve as the main database provider; 1 complete
              geographic positioning system capable of downloading data to the hub platform;
              1 256-grey-level class-D scanner; and additional required software to support
              continued expansion of the environmental science curricula developed since
              1985.    The use of these resources supports undergraduate training in
              ARC/INFO, ERDAS IMAGINE, and related systems in order to develop a
              professionally trained workforce to staff Federal, state, local, and private
              resource management agencies.  This project enables the Biological and
              Environmental Sciences Department to improve its curriculum and, at the same
              time, give students hands-on experience with systems used in the real world. 
              The ultimate outcome of the project may be Environmental Science graduates who
              are better prepared to enter a rapidly expanding job market or to continue in
              graduate education.
