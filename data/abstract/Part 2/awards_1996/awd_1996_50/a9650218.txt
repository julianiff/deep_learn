Abstract    :
               The project involves implementing polymer characterization by gel permeation
              chromatography (GPC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) into the
              chemistry program. The use of GPC and DSC provides essential information to
              enhance student understanding of the properties of polymers. GPC yields polymer
              molecular weight and DSC provides thermal properties of polymers.   The labs
              affected by these instruments include polymer, organic, physical-inorganic, and
              instrumental chemistry. In the polymer lab, polymerizations are being performed
              with subsequent characterization. Other experiments include polymer
              fractionation, polymer blend miscibility, and annealing studies. In the organic
              chemistry lab, molecular weight and thermal characterization of polyethylene
              terephthalate and nylon 6,10 are being conducted. The integrated
              physical-inorganic lab utilizes GPC to measure the molecular weight of an
              inorganic polymer and DSC to obtain enthalpy values corresponding to ligand
              strength in inorganic complexes. The instrumental lab is being updated by
              employing DSC in thermometric titrimetry.
