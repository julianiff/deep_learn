Abstract    :
              This proposal requests equipment to improve the facilities for an advanced
              undergraduate laboratory in optics offered at Cal Poly. The equipment is
              primarily to teach the physics associated with volume holography and introduce
              physics and engineering students to the technologically important area of
              layered dielectric media. Students will holographically record gratings in
              photopolymer and characterize the gratings as a function of index modulation,
              thickness of medium, angle of incidence and wavelength of replay. Fundamental
              physical concepts such as the angular spectrum, phase matching and Bragg
              scattering will be demonstrated and the students will become acquainted with
              the notions of coupled wave theory.
