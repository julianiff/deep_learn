Abstract    :
               This project supports the purchase of computers and nine pieces of software in
              order to integrate state-of-the-art molecular visualization and computational
              chemistry into the organic and general chemistry courses.   Problems addressed
              by this project include the cost of maintaining equipment, such as infrared
              (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrophotometers, for instructional
              purposes; the need to revise instruction in organic chemistry to keep up with
              developments in the actual practice of chemistry; the challenge of motivating
              introductory-level students and non-science-majors; and the difficulty of
              helping students visualize three-dimensional molecular structures.   The
              objectives are to (1) develop and incorporate exercises which teach chemistry
              concepts using software to simulate actual equipment; (2) develop and implement
              a revised organic chemistry curriculum that mates computation with
              experimentation and provides students with clear understanding of molecular
              structure and computational chemistry; and (3) use computer-enhanced
              instruction to illustrate the real-world relevance of the material being taught
              to help students visualize the structure they are studying and to motivate
              student learning.   To accomplish these objectives, the project director has
              carefully selected software and has conceived curricular revisions and
              exercises. Substantial time has been devoted to developing a proposed reshaping
              of the relevant laboratory curricula so as to deliver significant instructional
              enhancement.   This project can have significant impact in advancing chemistry
              students' understanding and in enabling introductory students and nonmajors to
              see the importance of the submicroscopic world.
