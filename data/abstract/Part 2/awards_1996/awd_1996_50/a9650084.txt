Abstract    :
               The project is integrating thermal analysis instrumentation into the curriculum
              of the Chemistry Department. Differential scanning calorimetry and
              thermogravimetric analysis are complementary techniques that provide unique and
              significant information about both the chemical reactions and the physical
              changes occurring in a sample. The instrumentation is being used in three
              upper-level chemistry courses, to allow students to experience its use as a
              quantitative analytical tool.  It is also being used as a way to obtain data on
              physical changes, such as glass transition temperatures in polymers, that are
              difficult to obtain by other means.   This instrumentation is being used to
              perform experiments that connect the field of chemistry to other closely
              related sciences, such as materials science, polymer science, and biology.  It
              is familiarizing students with a technique that is not commonly included in the
              undergraduate curriculum, but is frequently used in commercial and industrial
              laboratories, particularly those that deal with materials-related problems. 
              Thermal analysis instrumentation provides additional experience to students in
              the characterization of compounds, which is complementary to the microscale
              techniques already used.
