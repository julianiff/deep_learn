Abstract    :
              In this project, current meters, portable water laboratories, and well
              monitoring equipment are being used to enhance student experiences in
              undergraduate hydrology.  Within 5 years, the project may benefit over 125
              students in environmental science and earth and space science education.   
              This curriculum improvement is providing students with important experience in
              collecting and interpreting hydrologic data, using the data in decision-making
              processes, and communicating technical information in practical writings.   
              The final course project is to characterize streams draining areas of variable
              land-use and geology in a small drainage basin near the campus.  Student teams
              design a study, collect data, and interpret results, their goal being to
              determine major factors that influence the quality of surface and ground waters
              in the basin.  Results can be communicated in the form of poster sessions and
              briefings. With diverse backgrounds in biology, earth science, and geography,
              each student can contribute a unique set of skills and knowledge to the team
              effort.  These laboratory experiences are of particular importance to the
              preparation of pre-service teachers. Learning exercises in environmental
              hydrology will provide training in both scientific content and the process of
              scientific investigation that will serve these students throughout their
              teaching careers.
