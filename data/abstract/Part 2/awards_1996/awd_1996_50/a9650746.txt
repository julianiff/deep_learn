Abstract    :
               The Physics Department is furnishing two dedicated computer laboratory rooms,
              each with 13 multimedia computer workstations and a portable capture
              workstation.  The 26 workstations are being networked to a file server that
              contains a library of video clips.  The department is also purchasing Pasco
              Science Workshop Interfaces, probes, dynamica tracks, and carts for MBL
              experiments.  Video cameras, VCRs, laserdisc players, and video clips are
              available for students to do video experiments.  Two student workstations are
              on an NT-shaped worktable with a primary group of four students collaborating
              on an experiment.  Six worktables are placed in a U formation around a lab room
              so that the instructor can monitor students' progress at a glance.  The Tools
              for Scientific Thinking curriculum for MBL experiments and Workshop Physics
              curriculum for video experiments are being adapted for the use of multisection
              elementary physics courses with large lecture sizes.  These curricula encourage
              students to take an active role in their learning and construct physical
              knowledge from actual observation.
