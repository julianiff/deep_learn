Abstract    :
               This project is developing a real-time, interactive flight test program based
              on an active Flight Test Engineering program being conducted at the University
              of Florida (UF). Using a Cessna 172 aircraft configured with a unique
              instrumentation system, participants are performing airborne experiments at UF
              and doing much of the data reduction and analysis in real time on board the
              aircraft. Part of the project involves sending video and other sensor data from
              the aircraft to classrooms at four universities using video-conferencing, so
              that the classes may actively participate in a real-time flight test. Each
              group has the opportunity to act as "mission control" and direct the experiment
              at least once. All of the schools are in simultaneous video and voice contact
              with the other stations and in voice contact with the aircraft during the
              experiments. Member schools are developing and proposing additional flight test
              experiments.
