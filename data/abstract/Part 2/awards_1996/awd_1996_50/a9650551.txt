Abstract    :
               The project consists of enhancing the laboratory content of an existing
              biochemical engineering course. The bio-engineering laboratory is being used in
              three separate week-long experiments and one quarter-long independent research
              project. The three basic modules are as follows:  (1.) Basic Techniques_safety
              and culture of different types of cell using sterile technique;  (2.)
              Biomolecular Separation_protein and nucleic acid electrophoresis along with
              polysaccharide separation using open column GPC;  (3.) Microbial
              Fermentation_Quantification of growth parameters and mathematically modeling of
              the reactor.   The independent project is open ended and determined by the
              student within the timed budget constraints of the course. This project takes a
              minimum of 30 hours to complete and requires an oral presentation of the
              results.   Major pieces of equipment required for support of this course
              include a water purification system, laminar flow hood, -80+C freezer, an
              Inverted phase contrast microscope, and a personal computer. This equipment can
              be utilized by other laboratory courses in biology chemistry and chemical
              engineering.These improvements can result in graduates of chemical engineering
              who are more prepared to work with scientists with bioscience backgrounds.
