Abstract    :
               This institution, a small 4-year, historically Black institution, is enhancing
              its biology laboratories. Although the State of Missouri approved an expanded
              mission and additional degree programs in 1993, years of underfunding have left
              this college lacking the equipment necessary for effective undergraduate
              teaching. This is particularly true of the laboratory experience. The addition
              of an approved biology specialization area in the new secondary education
              program has meant that, while enrollment in upper-level biology laboratory
              courses has increased, the college has been unable to provide students with the
              hands-on laboratory experiences essential to preservice teachers. The
              conceptual foundation and thorough understanding gained through advanced
              laboratory experiments greatly enhances the entering teachers' ability to teach
              secondary-school science. The use of current technology in molecular biology
              and biotechnology, including differential centrifugation, ultraviolet
              spectrophotometric DNA analysis, and gel electrophoresis is a necessary
              practice, not a luxury.   The preservice teacher has a particularly important
              role in the education of underrepresented groups. With a student enrollment
              that is 75 percent African American, this college has a long record of service
              to the nontraditional, first-generation college student from an economically
              disadvantaged background. Most participants are minority women themselves and,
              upon graduation, are likely to teach in predominantly minority, urban schools,
              mainly in the City of St. Louis. The long-range impact may be that a new
              generation of well-prepared teachers are making their own students ready for
              the challenges of the 21st century.
