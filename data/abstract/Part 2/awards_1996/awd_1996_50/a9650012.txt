Abstract    :
               The laboratory course that is the basis of this project is a timely addition to
              the recently expanded program on molecular and developmental biology. This
              course enables undergraduates to acquire a research experience with the benefit
              of a class structure; its aim is to stimulate interest in scientific research
              by presenting experimentation as an intellectual adventure. To this end, the
              course is designed to engage the student in actual research by its project-like
              format and by an investigative approach in interpreting lab results. With the
              use of polymerase-chain-reaction-based cloning techniques, radically shortened
              protocols allow undergraduates to clone novel genes from genomic DNA, then
              sequence and analyze genes with polymorphic differences, in less than 14
              sessions. The student can perform the whole range of activities needed to clone
              and characterize a gene. The pooled results of the class can contain high
              sequence variation and resemble extensive experimentation by a research group.
              Each student, in the final paper, acts as a principal investigator.   Two pilot
              classes have been conducted, and the program is now expanding through the
              purchase of equipment that permits further development of experiments, provides
              for a larger class, upgrades the instruments currently in use, and perfects
              procedures, making it possible for the course to be emulated elsewhere.
