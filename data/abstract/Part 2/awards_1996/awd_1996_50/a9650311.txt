Abstract    :
              Mayville State University is a small university serving a rural area.
              Thirty-four percent of the college students impacted are preservice teachers. 
              The request is for computer workstations and probes for use primarily in
              laboratories associated with an interdisciplinary general education science
              course.  In addition the equipment will be used in discipline-based science
              laboratories.  We want our students to be computer literate; to achieve
              competency in critical thinking and problem solving skills; and to gain a
              comprehensive view of the sciences. Approximately one-third of the student
              population will be affected initially, and ultimately all of the student body
              will benefit from the improved technology. Program results will be disseminated
              on the internet and in articles for two publications. Workshops will be held
              for area high school teachers and students to demonstrate the potential of
              multimedia in the classroom. A survey instrument will be completed by the
              students to evaluate the effectiveness of this project.
