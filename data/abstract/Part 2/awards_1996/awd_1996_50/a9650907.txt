Abstract    :
               Opportunities for enhancing undergraduate education in geosciences through a
              range of computer-based technologies are growing rapidly. These opportunities
              include models and visualizations of processes that take place at large space
              or time scales, maps and satellite imagery, digitizers, large databases, and
              software for data analysis. The objective of this project is to significantly
              improve the education provided by increasing capabilities to incorporate these
              opportunities in courses for general education students and undergraduate
              majors in geology, hydrology, earth sciences, earth sciences teaching, and
              ultimately an emerging marine sciences curriculum. To accomplish this, the
              project will provide funds for the purchase of 16 personal computers that are
              being installed in a computer classroom and linked into the department and
              university networks and the Internet, along with basic software to run the
              applications identified.
