Abstract    :
              This project supports the development of a geographic information systems
              laboratory with 10 personal computers. The laboratory is being used to teach
              undergraduates the principles of geographic analysis and geographic information
              systems (GIS) and to provide them with hands-on experience with applications in
              both the natural and social sciences.  Computers with the ability to run state
              of the art GIS software are essential in providing a complete education for the
              undergraduate students. The project laboratory is located within the Department
              of Geography, Geology, and Anthropology and offers opportunities to students in
              a variety of disciplines across the campus. This project is establishing
              cooperative arrangements with state and local governments and businesses to
              acquire local data and expertise in the development of a central
              Indiana-Illinois GIS database that can be used as the foundation of the GIS
              education.
