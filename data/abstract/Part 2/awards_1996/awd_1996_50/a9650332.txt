Abstract    :
               In accordance with the Chemistry Department's goal of providing a premier
              education in chemistry for its undergraduates by the year 2000, the department
              is equipping the Chemistry Interactive Learning Center (CILC) with a network of
              16 Pentium-based computers and 1 SGI Indigo2 Workstation.   This center is an
              upper-division teaching facility that permits learning to take place with
              integrated flexible instructional formats and is essential for the
              implementation of curricular changes that enhance student training for the
              real-world workplace. The curriculum changes target the use of cutting-edge
              computer and multimedia technologies to integrate concept learning with the
              development of communication, management, critical thinking, and
              problem-solving skills in the following chemistry major courses: Basic
              Inorganic Chemistry, Quantitative Analysis, Physical Chemistry, Instrumental
              Analysis, and Polymer Chemistry.   The CILC can be a crucial segment of the
              learning infrastructure available to chemistry students. The CILC is to serve
              as a model for other university chemistry departments considering the use of
              multimedia technologies to integrate concept learning with skills development
              in integrated course/laboratory instruction.
