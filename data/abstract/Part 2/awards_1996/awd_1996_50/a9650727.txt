Abstract    :
               The project is incorporating the Hewlett Packard gas chromatography/mass
              spectrometer HP 6890 GC/MS, a benchtop GC/MS with an electron ionization and a
              chemical ionization detector, in to the sophomore organic lab for chemistry
              majors, the Honors general and organic chemistry, and the senior level organic
              and inorganic laboratories. This system provides all the necessary features for
              effective use in an undergraduate organic laboratory environment, namely high
              sensitivity and accurate reproducible quantitation, but at the same time it is
              very easy to use and very reliable. The Chemistry Department has made a
              conscious effort to include more instrumentation in the undergraduate
              laboratories in order to expose students to modern techniques and to
              incorporate more experiments requiring higher-level and independent thinking.
              The instrument is being used in organic qualitative analysis to supplement
              existing equipment, and in the independent research projects done by
              undergraduates of all levels.
