Abstract    :
               The objective of this project is to introduce the field of surface chemistry to
              undergraduate students using the technique of scanning tunneling microscopy
              (STM). In order to accomplish this goal, faculty are developing a sequence of
              three experiments for the physical chemistry laboratory course that will
              introduce the students to surface structure and dynamics. Although a number of
              different experiments will be evaluated for use in the undergraduate
              laboratory, a possible set of experiments could be as follows:  1. Analyze the
              highly oriented pyrolitic graphite surface in air.  2. Compare the graphite
              surface in air and in water.  3. Analyze the electrochemical deposition of a
              metal on the graphite surface by correlating the rate or amount of deposition
              and the change in the surface structure.   Surface chemistry is an important
              branch of physical chemistry that is generally not included in undergraduate
              courses. Although most surface analytical equipment is expensive and difficult
              to use, the STM method is relatively simple. Most importantly, the capability
              of the STM method to image surfaces in air and liquids allows experiments on
              surfaces to be accomplished without the added complication of ultra-high vacuum
              equipment. Therefore, it is an ideal tool for an undergraduate teaching
              laboratory. The new equipment can also be used for undergraduate research
              projects.
