Abstract    :
              This project is developing a computer classroom in which mathematics and
              statistics classes meet to use interactive computer activities. The laboratory
              has three main objectives:  (1) to increase the accessibility of computer
              classroom time for computer activities that are in current use, (2) to meet the
              increasing demands of mathematics and statistics instructors for facilities to
              offer these kinds of activities in their courses, and (3) to promote the use of
              new software technology to acquire, modify, and refine existing activities and
              to create new activities for mathematics and statistics classes. The third of
              these is focusing on newly available software called Mathwright. This is an
              authoring tool for highly developed windows style interactive lessons called
              workbooks. Mathwright workbooks feature high quality graphics, animation,
              sound, data entry and manipulation, and symbolic operations in a point and
              click setting. Mathwright enables the teacher to create these workbooks using
              an interactive composition facility. The project is providing a development
              site for these workbooks, holding a faculty workshop on Mathwright software,
              and providing a laboratory assistant trained to use Mathwright and to retrieve
              Mathwright activities from the national library. They are also holding a local
              conference to demonstrate our Mathwright creations for faculty from other
              institutions.
