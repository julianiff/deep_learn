Abstract    :
               The goal of this project is to develop an undergraduate digital microprocessor
              laboratory for electrical engineering technology students. Until now,
              electronics courses have not offered practical laboratory experience in digital
              design. A series of experiments has been developed that effectively
              accomplishes this goal. Twelve workstations are being acquired. Each station
              consists of a Pentium-class personal computer equipped with a 68HC11 EVB
              microprocessor development board, a Universal Design Lab Platform experiment
              board, and ORCADTM software for logic verification and printed circuit layout. 
               Students now receive hands-on experiences in basic digital electronics and
              microprocessor hardware design. Students are able to conceive, design, and
              simulate digital circuits. The new laboratory experiences serve as part of a
              revised and updated digital electronics and microprocessor courses and can
              consolidate, add, reinforce, and update the skills taught in the old sequence
              of design courses.
