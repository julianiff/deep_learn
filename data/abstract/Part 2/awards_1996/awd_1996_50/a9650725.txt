Abstract    :
              The acquisition of the Fourier-transform-infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer
              allows the chemistry program to improve and update the chemistry laboratory
              curriculum.  Applications of FTIR spectrophotometer are being incorporated into
              all chemistry courses with the emphasis on organic chemistry.  Organic
              chemistry students use the FTIR to study functional group interconversion,
              identify unknowns, follow the progress of reactions, and help establish the
              level of purity of synthesized compounds. Other introductory general chemistry
              classes may use the FTIR in the chemistry content related to carbon compounds
              and experiments.  The introduction of the FTIR spectrophotometer into the
              chemistry program, particularly into the teaching of Organic Chemistry, is
              aligning the curriculum and laboratory experiences that students receive with
              the expectations and practice of 4-year transfer institutions and in industry.
