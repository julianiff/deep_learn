Abstract    :
               This project expands the undergraduate computer systems curriculum through an
              introduction to high-performance computing. Until now, the computing facilities
              could not support such courses. Funds are being used to acquire the necessary
              hardware and software to teach two new courses, one on parallel processing and
              one on experimental computer science. The first course is based on a novel
              approach that emphasizes parallel languages as a bridge between parallel
              architectures and parallel algorithms. The second course is quite likely an
              absolute first. Organized exclusively around experiments, it teaches students
              how to evaluate high-performance technology. Together, and in the context
              offered by the rest of the undergraduate curriculum, these courses can
              strengthen students' ability to deal with cutting-edge technology. By
              dissemination through the World Wide Web, this project can support the
              development of similar courses in other universities.
