Abstract    :
               The general chemistry laboratory experience at most large public institutions
              in this country is characterized by tedious manipulations that often appear to
              take precedence over the development of an appreciation for the underlying
              physical phenomena. The chemistry department is removing the busy work from
              laboratories by introducing computer equipment and commercially available
              transparent interfaces for data acquisition and analysis. These laboratory
              workstations serve as platforms for molecular visualization. They allow
              students to learn more while they stimulate student interest in science. The
              intention is not to replace wet chemistry experiments with computer
              simulations, but rather to bring the data-collection methods used in those
              experiments into the modern era. In short, the focus in these courses is
              shifting from data generation to data interpretation and understanding. By
              making routine use of computers in the large service courses, the university
              maximizes the number of students affected by the project and provides the
              largest possible audience with a modern approach to the practice of chemistry.
