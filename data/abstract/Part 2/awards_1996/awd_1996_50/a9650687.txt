Abstract    :
               Rheological (flow and deformation) properties of polymers are the most
              important factors affecting the microstructure of polymers, critical process
              parameters for polymer production and processing, and subsequent product
              quality. The focus of this project is the acquisition of a
              computer-instrumented laboratory capillary rheometer (LCR) and on-line process
              rheometer (OLPR) such that students can experimentally investigate and observe
              the rheological phenomena of plastics through laboratory testing and on-line
              process monitoring.   Several laboratory experiments have been planned to allow
              students to use the state-of-the-art LCR/OLPR equipment to study (1) the
              effects of processing parameters on the rheological properties of a polymer
              melt during processing and on the mechanical and physical properties of final
              products, (2) process monitoring, control, optimization, and automation, (3)
              the application of computer-instrumented technology in rheometry, (4) the
              application of the LCR/OLPR in recycling and processability analysis, (5)
              rheological data analysis using statistical techniques, and (6) the integration
              of the LCR/OLPR with computer-assisted design, manufacture, and engineering.  
              The LCR/OLPR project greatly enhances both the materials engineering and
              polymer processing programs in the Manufacturing Systems Engineering and
              Mechanical Engineering curricula. It can directly affect students enrolled in
              the following two courses: Engineering Materials and Polymer Processing. Data
              provided from the LCR/OLPR equipment can be beneficial to all courses in which
              discussions focus upon the relationship between the rheological, physical, and
              mechanical properties of polymeric materials, such as Material
              Characterization, Polymer Science, Adhesive Technology and Applications, and
              Industrial Painting Technology.
