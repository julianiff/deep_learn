Abstract    :
               This project introduces improved organic laboratory experiments, new analytical
              laboratory projects, and enhanced undergraduate research experiences through
              the use of hyphenated gas chromatography/Fourier-transform infrared (GC/FTIR)
              spectrometry. Traditional macro- and micro-scale lab projects in organic
              chemistry can benefit from shorter analysis times, reduced chemical waste, and
              higher sensitivity when GC/FTIR replaces the traditional, sequential
              application of these techniques. New lab projects are being developed for
              analytical chemistry laboratories which examine both fundamental and applied
              aspects of this important hyphenated technique. Finally, ongoing and planned
              research projects involving undergraduate students also benefit from the use of
              GC/FTIR.   The implementation of this project can yield a meaningful
              enhancement of the laboratory experiences for students. Beyond the practical
              benefits of time efficiency and waste minimization, the use of such a modern,
              computer-controlled analytical system provides valuable training to
              undergraduates, better qualifying them for entry into the chemical workforce or
              advanced study programs.
