Abstract    :
              The project is designed to develop a laboratory for students in General
              Psychology courses. General Psychology meets a general education core
              requirement; thus, students from very different academic disciplines enroll in
              the course.  Students learn a variety of psychophysiological measuring
              techniques using the BioPac Student Laboratory program and serve as
              experimenters or participant subjects employing ready-to-use MacLaboratory and
              Psychological Disorders software programs.  Although learned in the context of
              Psychology, the laboratory and reasoning skills accquired are transferable to
              other scientific discovery settings and to general problem-solving situations.
              The development plan includes the recruitment of advanced Psychology majors and
              graduate students to learn CAI techniques and to assist in laboratory
              instruction and supervision.
