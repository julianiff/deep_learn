Abstract    :
              9633501  Fryer    The PIs study the relationship between the structure of South 
              Marina forearc and sites of volcanism and fluid venting. Venting  areas are
              accessible in the Mariana convergent plate system because  its lacks an
              accretionary sediment wedge. The compilation of  bathymetric and sonar imagery
              data will provide a basis from which  to map seafloor structures. Seismic and
              MR1 survey will identify  sites for detailed observations of fluid venting. Six
              channel  seismic reflection data will be gathered during a month-long  cruise.
