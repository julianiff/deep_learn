Abstract    :
              OCE 96-33713   Flament      The project will complete analysis of data obtained
              during    the Tropical Instability Wave Experiment (TIWE).  The    analysis
              will focus on describing the structure and    dynamics of eddies observed in
              association with tropical    instability waves during the experiment. The eddy
              kinetic    energy budget will be computed and the conversion of heat    and
              momentum from mean-flow to eddies will be estimated.    Drifter trajectories
              will be analyzed to determine the    convergent velocities associated with the
              instability.    Numerical model output will be analyzed and compared with   
              observations in an attempt to generalize the dynamical    understanding gained
              from the experiment.
