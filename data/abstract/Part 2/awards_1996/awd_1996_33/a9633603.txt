Abstract    :
              9633603  SUN    Degradation rate constants for several planktonic lipid compound
               will be investigated under controlled laboratory conditions.  Activity of
              benthic animals was the most likely factor causing the  difference observed
              between rate constants oxic and anoxic  sediments profiles measured in the
              field. Animals can alter  oxic/anoxic versus anoxic conditions in
              remineralization efficiency  and formation of intermediate products show that
              degradation  follows different pathways. Research will specially consider the 
              effects on degradation between oxic and anoxic conditions caused by  benthic
              animals. Radiolabelled tracers degradation rates and  pathways under various
              influences of benthic animals. Further  intensive study of the structure of
              metabolites produced during  incubation experiments will provide a more
              detailed picture of the  degradation of these important compounds.
