Abstract    :
              Global competition and rapidly changing technology make it critical that we
              understand how organizations can adapt to a changing environment so that they
              can maintain or improve their performance.  Organizations respond to the
              environment through redesign (downsizing, upsizing, or re-engineering various
              tasks).  Further, organizations frequently cope with changes such as 
              journeymen personnel who pursue their careers by moving among organizations. 
              Organizational adaptation presumably contributes greatly to organizational
              productivity, even as individual learning contributes to personal productivity.
               However, little is known about organizational adaptation, and particularly
              about whether such adaptation even has the theoretical possibility of 
              improving performance given that individuals are themselves learning.  A
              computational framework for theorizing about organizational adaptation and
              performance will be developed and used to explore the conditions under which
              adaptation leads to performance improvements.  This framework employs 
              simulated annealing algorithms for locating optimal organizational structures
              in fixed and volatile environments.  The effect of organizational adaptation,
              particularly when personnel are journeymen will be examined.  Questions to be
              addressed include:  What adaptation strategies are most effective?  What types
              of organizations emerge as high performers, particular when personnel are
              journeymen?  Does the technology transfer that occurs when personnel journey
              among organizations lead to organizational performance improvements?
