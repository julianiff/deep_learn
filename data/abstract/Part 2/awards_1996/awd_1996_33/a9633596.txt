Abstract    :
              9633596  Ludwig    While much progress has been made in understanding 
              equilibrium phase diagrams, transformation kinetics has been  more difficult to
              calculate or simulate with quantitative  accuracy.  This is particularly true
              when there are  complicating factors such as long-period superlattice phases 
              and coupling between strain and ordering.  By combining 
              synchrotron-based-time-resolved x-ray scattering  capabilities with
              recently-developed binding energy  calculations and supercomputer technology
              significant  advances can be made.  State-of-the-art energy calculations  in
              Monte-Carlo simulations are used to understand, and  predict, complex ordering
              kinetics as observed by time-  resolved x-ray diffraction.  The calculations
              allow for  local relaxation of atoms off their ideal lattice sites as  well as
              global lattice relaxation and symmetry change.  The  focus is on the classic
              CuAu alloy, which possesses ordered  and modulated phases as well as a lattice
              symmetry change  upon ordering.  Other important issues to be investigated 
              include the presence of separate ordering spinodals for  modulated and ordered
              phases, formation kinetics of the  ordered phase from the modulated phase, and
              the coupling  between strain and order.  In addition to CuAu alloys, other 
              systems which exhibit long-period superlattice phases will  be investigated, in
              particular Ti-Al alloys which exhibit a  devil's staircase of modulated phases.
               %%%  Ordering kinetics in many alloys is complicated by the  presence of
              long-range superlattice phases and/or changes in  lattice constant and
              symmetry.  Understanding the changes in  such systems is a major challenge to
              materials scientists.  ***
