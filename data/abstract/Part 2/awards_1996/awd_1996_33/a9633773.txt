Abstract    :
              Circulation of seawater through the ocean crust has a major effect  on the
              chemistry of seawater.  The composition of the water that  exits from hot
              springs could tell us what processes occur in the  ocean crust to form the
              water.  Some processes have been proposed  that result in the observed rare
              earth element, alkali element,  calcium, and strontium isotope composition of
              the exit waters.  The  hypotheses about potential subsurface reactions can be
              tested by  analyzing the major minerals and their alteration products for 
              trace elements and strontium isotopes.  These investigators have  new
              analytical techniques that will allow them to determine trace  elements in
              minerals from rocks recovered from below the sea floor  and test the
              hypotheses.
