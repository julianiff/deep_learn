Abstract    :
                    This "undershooting" experiment, on the East Pacific Rise  between 8 and
              10 degrees north, will use seismic velocity  and attenuation and anomalies of
              Pn arrivals, and Sn waves  if they are observed, to map km-scale variations in
              the  vertical distribution on melt near the base of the crust  along the ridge
              axis.  The magnitude and orientation of  anisotropy in Pn velocities will be
              used to constrain the  direction of mantle flow near the Moho.  The goals of
              the  project are to: (1) map along-axis variations in the seismic  velocity and
              attenuation structure of the uppermost mantle  along he entire segment, (2) map
              the orientation and  magnitude of anisotropy in the uppermost mantle, (3) 
              determine the vertical structure of the lowermost crust,  Moho transition zone,
              and uppermost mantle directly beneath  the axis of accretion at three
              contrasting sites, (4)  measure crustal thickness variations along an entire 
              transform-bounded ridge segment, and (5) compare the results  with existing
              observations and models of segmentation.
