Abstract    :
              9633009  Bentley  Virus-like particles (VLP's) are viral coat protein 
              structures devoid of any functional nucleic acids, DNA  or RNA.  As such, they
              offer the possibility of safe,  effective, multivalent, and low cost vaccines
              for human  and animal viral diseases.  Professor Bentley and  Vikharia propose
              to study this relatively new phenomena  using the well characterized
              baculovirus/insect cell  system to generate the chimeric proteins.  They
              propose  a basic study of the variables that influence the  production and
              perform and of these particles.  Among  the questions to be answered are: what
              structural  proteins are necessary and at what levels for the  assembly of
              VLP's for two important poultry virus, IBDV  and avian reovirus? what factors
              influence the  expression of the VLP's? and what problems are  associated with
              VLP separation and stability:  The  viral protein genes will be substituted for
              the  baculovirus AcNPV coat protein, polyhedrin, which is  not required for the
              replication and maintenance of the  baculovirus in-vitro.  ***
