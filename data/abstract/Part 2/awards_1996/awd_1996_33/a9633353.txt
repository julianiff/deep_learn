Abstract    :
              9633353  Alt    Circulation of sea water through the ocean crust has a major
              effect  on the chemistry of the oceans. This is fairly well understood at 
              mid-ocean ridges because the composition of the exiting fluids is  known.
              However, off-axis venting has a larger effect on ocean  chemistry but the
              venting is widespread and has not yet been  sampled. Our only knowledge of the
              effect of off-axis circulation  on seawater is from rocks that have been
              recovered by drilling. The  PIs will measure the composition of minerals from
              drill hole and  determine their abundance to estimate how much water has
              circulated  through the crust and how it changed the crust.
