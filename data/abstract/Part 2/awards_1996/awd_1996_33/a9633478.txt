Abstract    :
                  Abstract    The Polar Research Board (PRB), a unit of the National Research
              Council, was established in 1958 to advise the government on polar issues.  The
              PRB strives to make research in the polar regions more productive and
              responsive to the needs of the United States, to maintain U.S. awareness of and
              representation in international science programs, and to enhance understanding
              of issues in polar regions.  The Board provides national and international
              scientific and technical information to U.S. government policy makers and the
              polar community, represents U.S. interests in international nongovernmental
              polar scientific organizations, and conducts focused studies in areas of polar
              science, technology, and resource management.  The PRB facilitates
              participation of U.S. scientists in two critical international committees
              dedicated to planning and coordinating research in the Arctic and Antarctic
              (i.e., IASC and SCAR).  PRB activities are conducted by a group of volunteer
              experts, supported by a small staff, selected from academic institutions,
              industry, and national laboratories.    The PRB will continue to serve as an
              information center for distributing materials on IASC and SCAR to U.S.
              government agencies and the polar community.  Other federal agencies and
              foundations also provide support to the PRB.
