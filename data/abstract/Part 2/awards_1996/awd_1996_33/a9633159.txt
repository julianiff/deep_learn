              Minority Institutions Infrastructure Grant: Expanding the Minority Pipeline:
              C.S. at Fisk University    Fisk University, a small HBCU-MI with 69.8% female
              students has an outstanding reputation of producing highly qualified graduates
              in many scientific disciplines.  As such, Fisk is excellently situated to be
              instrumental in the national effort to increase the numbers of
              African-Americans and women in computer science.  The purpose of this project
              is to design a five-year plan for the development of the human and
              technological infrastructure necessary for Fisk to be a national model for the
              attraction and retention of female and African-American computer science
              students.    To attain this goal Bellin and Monroe of North Carolina
              Agricultural & Technical State University recommend that three main program
              components be addressed: recruiting, mentoring and graduate study (Computing
              Research News, Jan. 95).  Instead of targeting isolated aspects of the student
              experience, a broad strategy that manages all stages of student progress from
              high school to professional career is proposed.  Recruitment is addressed by
              outreach and bridge programs, and expanded computer science specific
              recruitment efforts.  Retention strategies include scholarships and mentoring
              at all levels.  The establishment of a graduate degree program and
              under-graduate research programs is an integral part of the plan.  The enhanced
              infrastructure supports the expansion of faculty research programs which are
              the basis for student research activities.
