Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT     Three-dimensional radiative heat transfer in a finite medium will
              be studied theoretically and experimentally.  The emphasis of the investigation
              is to determine the effects of multiple scattering and polarization in media
              that contain Mie-scattering particles.  The theoretical work will involve
              solving the vector radiative transport equation written in terms of the Stokes
              parameter and the scattering phase function expressed by a 4x4 phase matrix. 
              Double Fourier transform will be used to transform the transport equation into
              one-dimensional form and the resulting equation will be solved by
              Ambartsumian's method.  Back-scattered radiation from a medium composed of
              latex microspheres suspended in distilled water will be measured and the
              results will be used for model validation.
