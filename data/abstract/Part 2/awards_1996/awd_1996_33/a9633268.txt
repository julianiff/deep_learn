Abstract    :
              9633268  Rubin    Title: Recent ridge eruptive activity dating and
              investigations  (The "Rreadi" project).    Unlike volcanic eruptions on land,
              there are no observations of  eruption on the ocean floor. Undersea eruptions
              are inaccessible  and usually can not be detected by on-land measurements, so
              it is  not even known when eruptions occur. There are no techniques  available
              to determine the age of these lavas, so we can not place  samples from undersea
              eruptions in sequence. The PI has developed  a technique to determine the age
              of rocks based on the amount of  short-lived daughter products of the uranium
              and thorium decay  series. This technique has been successful for dating one
              young  eruption on the East Pacific Rise. This technique is only good for 
              samples less than 3 years old, and he wishes to extend this  technique to decay
              series that will date samples up to 100 years.
