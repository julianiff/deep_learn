Abstract    :
              9633777  BARBER  The NSF-owned Research Vessel CAPE HATTERAS has been operated
              under  a charter party agreement by the Duke/University of North Carolina 
              Consortium since it was put into service in 1981.  This project  extends the
              University's operation of the CAPE HATTERAS for five  years under an updated,
              modified charter party agreement.  ***
