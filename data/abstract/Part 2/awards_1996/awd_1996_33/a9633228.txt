Abstract    :
              9633228  Wilhelmson        The Principal Investigator will use existing
              observational data and a state of  the art three-dimensional mesoscale
              numerical model to investigate a range of  convective phenomena such as squall
              lines, severe storms, tornadoes, and gust  fronts.        Specific research
              objectives include: furthering the understanding of  non-supercell tornadoes
              that form along low level air mass boundaries; investigating  the role of
              boundary layer convergence/shear lines on the genesis of waterspouts;  studying
              the influence of horizontal shearing instability on initiation of deep 
              convection; examining fine-scale supercell structure and evolution; studying
              the  factors that control convective development along colliding outflow
              boundaries;  exploring the turret scale dynamics and entrainment within cumuli
              and the role of  boundary layer circulations in determining horizontal
              convective scales.        Successful completion of this research will provide
              basic insights into  atmospheric flows and guidance to those responsible for
              forecasting severe weather  events.  ***
