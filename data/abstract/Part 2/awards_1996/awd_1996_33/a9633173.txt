Abstract    :
              9633173  vanGreen         This award will support travel costs for the PI to
              visit colleagues  in Mexico and Chile to set up arrangements for monitoring of
              trace  metals (in particular Cd) as indicators of upwelling variations in 
              coastal waters. Local students will collect monthly samples of  water from
              selected sites along the coast and mail them to the PI's  lab for analysis. Cd
              has been shown to reflect the availability of  nutrients, and is incorporated
              in the shells of benthic  foraminifera. The water samples will provide a
              baseline to  determine the seasonal and interannual cycle of upwelling-related 
              production at each site; dated sediment sample of the benthic  foraminifera
              will then provide a record of upwelling variability  over the past few thousand
              years.
