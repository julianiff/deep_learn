Abstract    :
              Kunze  9633315    The characteristics of the internal waves and turbulence 
              field in Monterey  Submarine Canyon will be measured with a suite of  vertical 
              fine-scale and  microstructure  profilers and shipboard instruments to test 
              the hypothesis the  energy flux of up-canyon  propagating semi-diurnal internal
               waves is lost to  turbulent dissipation and mixing. Also of interest are the 
              shape, level  heterogeneity and anisotropy of the vertical wavenumber  spectrum
              on the fine-  scale (wavelength 10-50 m) as compared to that found in the  open
              ocean.  Finally, the turbulence measurements will be used to assess  the
              importance of  canyons to mixing at boundaries.
