              Theory of Photosynthetic Pigment  Regulation in Unicellular Algae:  Tests of  a
              Novel Hypothesis                                                               
                                                ABSTRACT                      Environmental 
              control  of  photosynthetic  pigmentation  in  microalgae  is  hypothesized  to
               depend  on  a  simple   control  mechanism   operating  around  photosystem  
              II   dynamics.   The  mechanisms  responsible  for photoacclimation  of 
              photosynthetic  pigments  have  eluded researchers for more than  5  decades.  
              A  "dynamic  balance" theory of photoacclimation is described  based  on 
              general behavior of the photosynthetic apparatus in  constant  and  fluctuating
              environments. This novel theory is the first  to  explain  how  pigment
              concentrations are optimized over  a  broad  range of light, nutrient, and
              temperature environments.        The  proposed research will directly test the
              dynamic balance  theory.   Four  taxonomically  diverse  microalgal  species  
              are  targeted for investigations. Controlled growth experiments  under 
              differing  photoacclimative conditions will provide a  basis  for  relating 
              photosynthetic response, pigmentation, and  photosystem  II  dynamics. It is
              anticipated that experimental support for the  theory  will  lead to the
              development of models  combining  other  known  photosynthetic regulatory
              mechanisms, resulting in a  more  general   appreciation  of  constraints  on 
              photosynthesis   and  mechanisms of energy balance in photosynthetic organisms.
