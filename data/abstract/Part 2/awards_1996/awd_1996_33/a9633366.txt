Abstract    :
              This renewal grant will conduct theoretical studies of the interactions of
              energetic particles with the solar wind and solar corona.  Broad-based studies
              will include interstellar pickup ions, galactic cosmic rays, solar energetic
              particles, and shock-accelerated particles.  The PI's goal is to understand the
              energetic particle structure of the heliosphere and fundamental processes that
              govern that structure.  Specific research tasks are:  (1) developing a
              transport theory for interstellar pickup ions based on the pitch-angle
              diffusion equation to predict the ion spatial distribution and anisotropy for
              large scattering mean free paths; (2) investigating the shock surfing mechanism
              at laminar and turbulent quasi-perpendicular shocks as the origin of energetic
              ions at cometary and interplanetary shocks and the solar wind termination
              shock; (3) studying the evolution of the solar wind helium distribution
              downstream of Earth's quasi-perpendicular bow shock; (4) exploring the
              consequences of an analytical treatment of cosmic ray transport at high
              energies; and (5) constructing an analytical theory of the acceleration of
              solar energetic electrons and ions in reconnecting current sheets in coronal
              loops for a realistic electromagnetic field configuration.***
