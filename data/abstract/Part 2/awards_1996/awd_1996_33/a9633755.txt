Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Davidson  9633755    We propose to conduct workshops to help
              engineering PhD students interested in becoming faculty members to succeed in
              their careers.  Each workshop will last one week and will include 30 PhD
              students selected from a pool of applicants.  Funding is requested for five
              workshops, one held each summer beginning in July 1996.  The program will
              include sessions on both education and research.  In the former category,
              examples of activities include presentations on cognitive processes involved in
              student learning, interactive discussions on teaching strategies, and exercises
              to permit workshop participants to develop their own course outlines.  In the
              latter category, there will be discussions on being an effective advisor to
              graduate students and on obtaining funding for research.  The workshops will be
              evaluated using both short-term and long-term assessments through questionaires
              and interviews.  Overall, the workshops are expected to have a significant
              effect on the productivity of those faculty members who participate, and on
              other new faculty members with whom our workshop participants interact.  ***
