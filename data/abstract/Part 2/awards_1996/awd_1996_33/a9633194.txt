Abstract    :
              9633194  Jaluria  The material flow processes and the thermal history of the
              optical fibers are two factors in determining  the quality of the fiber in the
              fiber drawing process. This project investigates innovation drawing control
              techniques for the fabrication of optical fibers. A systematic experimental
              study along with a detailed analytical/numerical model will be developed to
              study the residual stresses, generation and diffusion of defects, fiber
              diameter control, and the resulting refractive index variation in optical
              waveguides. Innovative techniques will be developed for drawing three types of
              preform materials and configurations, including the multi-layer case generally
              used in practice to validate the developed models.  The outcomes of the study
              are critical to the future needs in fiber fabrication process.  The research
              project has a balance between theory and experiment, and will provide valuable
              findings for the fiber fabrication industry.
