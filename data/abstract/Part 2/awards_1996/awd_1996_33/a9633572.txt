Abstract    :
              This project will work up the data collected during the ALVIN dive  cruise that
              responded to the eruption on the COAxial segment of the  Juan de Fuca Ridge in
              June 1993.  This study involves construction  of geological maps, shore-based
              chemical analyses of gas-tight  samples, reduction of data from the instruments
              left on the site  for nearly one year, and continued work on microbiological
              samples.   A significant goal of the program will be to characterize the 
              relationship between diking, volatile flux, and biological  activity.
