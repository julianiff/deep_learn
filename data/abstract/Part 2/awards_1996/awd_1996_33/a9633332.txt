Abstract    :
              OCE 96-33332  Chang    The project will the hypothesis that mixing and
              Lagrangian   transport due to equatorial trapped waves interacting with the  
              western boundary may account for the equatorial chlorofluorocarbon  (CFC)
              tongue which is observed to extend eastward at mid-depth in   the Atlantic. 
              The wave-induced mixing hypothesis will be extended  in this work by
              emphasizing near-surface generation and vertical   propagation of the Rossby
              and Yanai waves which are important to   the mixing mechanism.  A hierarchy of
              numerical experiments using   several general circulation models will be
              conducted to   investigate the contributions of wind forcing and shear  
              instability to wave generation.  Simulated particle trajectories   will be used
              to investigate wave induced mixing and transport in   the models, and the
              results will be compared to recent float   tracks from the region. This work is
              expected to clarify the role   of equatorial processes in the global
              thermohaline circulation.
