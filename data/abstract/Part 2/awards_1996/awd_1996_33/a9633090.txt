Abstract    :
              Scholars in the emerging field of emotion labor acknowledge the need for
              improved understanding and measurement of this construct's dimensionality. 
              Defined as the management of personal emotions to produce desired customer
              responses, emotion labor's relevance for our increasingly service-oriented
              economy underscores the need to  understand both the parameters or dimensional
              structure of this construct and its impact on various individually and
              organizationally relevant outcomes.   The objective of this Research Planning
              Grant is the identification of emotion labor's defining dimensions and the
              subsequent development of an index to measure these dimensions.  Toward this
              end, the research will 1) develop an item pool from literature review and
              qualitative methodologies to ascertain relevant dimensions of emotion labor; 2)
              administer an emotion labor item list to appropriate subjects, then use factor
              analytic techniques to extract significant dimensions; 3) construct and
              administer a revised emotion labor index; and 4) assess its validity and
              reliability as a measure of emotion labor.  With the availability of an
              appropriately developed and tested emotion labor index, more systematic
              research on this subject may result and concerns regarding its effect on the US
              work force may be better addressed.
