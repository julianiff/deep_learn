Abstract    :
              Objects are  programming abstractions that encapsulate  mutable internal  state
              and provide operations to manipulate the state.  Object-based computing  is the
              programming paradigm that uses objects to structure  the state-manipulation 
              carried out in programs.  The goal of this project is to  develop formal
              methods  for specifying, conceptualizing, and reasoning about object-  based
              programs.  These formal methods include:  (1) Type systems:  what kinds  of
              semantic entities  are involved in object-based programs, and how does one 
              capture them in type  systems for programming languages?  (2) Denotational 
              semantics:  what mathematical  abstractions are involved in capturing the
              bahaviors of  object-based programs?  (3) Specifications:  How does one specify
              the behaviors of  individual objects?  (4) Reasoning methods:  what methods are
              appropriate and  useful for proving properties  of object-based programs?   
              The Direction being pursued is to build on the several  decades of research in 
              functional programming so as ato achieve a "tight  integration" of programming 
              concepts and mathmatical tools in working with object-based  programs.  Of 
              primary focus are algebraic specification and equational  reasoning techniques 
              using lambda-calculus-based higher-order language  frameworks. ***
