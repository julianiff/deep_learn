Abstract    :
              9633554  Broecker    Climatic cooling enhances the deposition of ice rafted
              detritus  (IRD) every 1000 to 2000 years. Several such dampened events can be 
              found in the Holocene that thus something other than ice sheets may  be
              modulating these events. The PIs plan to target 3 layers, the  Younger Dryas,
              and H3 and H6 Heinrich events for special focus.  Multiple tools will be used
              to determine the likely sources for  IRD, including grain size, stable isotopic
              analysis, and  composition of Pb isotopes in feldspar grains and Ar/Ar in 
              hornblende to determine the provenance. Samples from the Hudson  Straits, Gulf
              of St. Lawrence, Denmark Straits and East Greenland  current areas may help
              identify the sources from Greenland,  Scandinavia, etc.
