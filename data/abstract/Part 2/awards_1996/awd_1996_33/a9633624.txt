Abstract    :
              Rapid prototyping environments provide high-level operations that  allow users
              rapidly to create and modify interactive  applications, such as graphical
              interfaces, scientific and  program visualizations, and simulations (i.e.,
              quickly program  the Obig pictureO). These environments often sacrifice speed
              and  storage for increased flexibility. Researchers have proposed 
              optimizations that can reduce storage and improve performance.  However, the
              programmer must manually apply these optimizations,  which impedes rapid,
              iterative development of applications.  The  objective of  this project is to
              develop adaptive, profile-based  compilation techniques that automatically
              apply these  optimizations so that the programmer can make use of rapid 
              prototyping techniques while still retaining excellent time and  storage
              performance. Constraints and structured graphics are  targeted by this research
              since studies show that these two  techniques facilitate the rapid, iterative
              development of  graphical user interfaces. This project is developing
              techniques  whereby: (1) a profiler monitors operations as they execute and 
              extracts information about constraint evaluation and variable  access, and (2)
              an adaptive compiler uses this information to  dynamically implement various
              performance and storage  optimizations.  ***
