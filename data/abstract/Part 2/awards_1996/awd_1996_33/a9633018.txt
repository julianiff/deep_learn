Abstract    :
              9633018  Yuen    This research planning grant (RPG) will support the planning 
              of  a systematic experimental investigation of novel layered  magnetic   
              materials,   the   metal-telluride    compounds.  Preparation  and 
              characterization will be  carried  out  to  produce  samples  with high
              homogeneity and  single  crystal  samples.  Magnetically oriented samples will
              be produced  in  high  magnetaic  fields at the National High Magnetic  Field 
              Laboratory  (NHMFL).   Various  measurements  will  be  made  including  
              susceptibility,  magnetization,  and  Mossbauer.  Preliminary experiments will
              be carried out.  %%%  This research planning grant (RPG) will support the
