Abstract    :
              9633664  Housner  The 1996 International Conference and Exposition on Natural 
              Disaster Reduction (NDR'96) is to be held in Washington,  D.C., December 3-5,
              1996.  It is organized by the American  Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) under
              the auspices of the  United Nations International Decade for Natural Disaster 
              Reduction (IDNDR), and supported by a number of United  States Federal
              agencies.  The purpose of the NDR'96 is to  promote and assess the role of
              civil engineering, through  its interaction with other disciplines, in
              mitigating,  preparing for a recovering from natural disaster impacts on  the
              built and natural environments.  Sessions have been  organized where the
              causes, effects and mitigation of  hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, tsunamis,
              landslides and  other natural hazards hazards will be discussed and where 
              advances in knowledge related to these types of disasters  will be presented. 
              Proceedings from NDR'96 will be given  worldwide dissemination which will
              provide the natural  hazards international community with an up-to-date source
              of  information on and a research agenda for natural disaster  reduction.  ***
