Abstract    :
              This project will analyze stable isotopes and CD/Ca in benthic  foraminifera
              from cores to be taken along a depth transect at  30degrees S off the coast of
              Brazil. Samples of bottom water will  be taken at each site and compared with
              the composition of living  foraminifera to verify the relationship of
              chemistries.  The  best cores will then be analyzed to examine changes in water
              mass  structure over the last glacial cycle, with sampling close enough  to
              resolve suborbital variability.  At issue is the linkage between  northern- and
              southern-source water masses.
