Abstract    :
              9633748  Barstow    This project is for an Invitational Planning Conference on
              "Student  and Scientist Partnerships for Authentic Science Research", to be 
              held in Washington, D.C. in September, 1996.  Included in the  project is
              preparation and distribution of a report based on the  conference proceedings,
              papers and recommendations.  The goal of  the Conference is to explore the
              emerging collaborations between  scientists and students to do authentic
              science and powerful  education in the K-12 classrooms.  The role of Conference
              attendees  is to examine the current state of the art, draw lessons from 
              existing student and scientists partnerships, suggest solutions to  barriers
              that hinder wider use of such partnerships, and develop  ways to interest more
              scientists and educators in this field.  The  goal in this conference is to
              take full advantage of this pivotal  opportunity to explore the potential of
              this field and to  collaboratively develop long-term action plans to tap into
              the  scientific and educational power of student/scientist partnerships  for
              authentic science research.
