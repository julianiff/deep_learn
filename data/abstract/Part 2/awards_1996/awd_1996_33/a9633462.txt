Abstract    :
              A critical issue for large-scale systems design and  evolution is the choice of
              an architectural style that  permits the integration of separately-developed
              components  into larger systems. Familiar styles include those based on  remote
              procedure call, shared variables, asynchronous  message passing, etc.  One
              increasingly important  architectural style for system composition is implicit 
              invocation (II).  However, there is no established basis for  reasoning about
              II systems. In particular it is difficult to  answer questions like: What will
              be the effect of announcing  a given event? Have enough event bindings been
              declared?  Does a given component announce the sufficient events to  permit
              effective integration? If I add a new component to an  existing system, will it
              break the existing system?  The  goal of this project is to provide such a
              basis for  reasoning about systems designed using the II architectural  style. 
              Two central benefits are expected.  The first  benefit is a step towards being
              able to reason fully about  systems constructed in this style. The second and
              probably  more important benefit is to replace current ad hoc  reasoning
              approaches used by practitioners who use the II  style with a collection of
              sound ideas that allow better  informal reasoning about such systems.  ***
