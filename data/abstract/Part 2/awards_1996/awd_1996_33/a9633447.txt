Abstract    :
              9633447  Walcoff    This project requests funds over 4 months to conduct
              planning  activities in support of an effort to communicate science and 
              mathematics reform to educators and the public.  The planning  period will
              conduct research in preparation of what could be a  larger initiative. 
              Specifically, the project will identify:         1)   issues and concerns of
              the public regarding math and            science reform;       2)   issues and
              concerns of professional educators about math            and science reform;   
                 3)   current misconceptions and biases regarding science and            math
              reform; and        4)   strategies for reaching the public with needed         
                information about these issues.
