Abstract    :
              9633750  Buck    The intent of this proposal is to seek funding for the support
              of  the Nuclear/High Energy Physics (NuHEP) Research Center of  Excellence of
              Hampton University for the next five years.  The long  range goal is to
              maintain an internationally competitive research  program in nuclear and high
              energy physics.  The Center was  established in September 1991 through a
              cooperative agreement with  the National Science Foundation.  The Center has
              met or exceeded  all of its original goals of that time and enjoys additional 
              funding from the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility  (CEBAF) and the
              U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).  One of the  original goals was to establish a
              Ph.D. Degree program at Hampton;  this goal has been met and the University is
              now in its fourth year  of that program, boasting a total of 45 graduate
              students in the  Department.  The NuHEP Center has established solid
              collaborative  programs with a variety of academic institutions and
              laboratories  in the United States and abroad.  The NuHEP Center has been used
              as  a model for the establishment of similar programs at other  Historically
              Black Colleges/Universities (HBCUs), as well as major  institutions.  The
              nuclear physics program has grown rapidly over  the past 12 years.  It has been
              demonstrated that high quality work  in nuclear physics can be performed at
              Hampton.  NSF renewed  funding of the Center offers the opportunity for the
              Center to  maintain and grow intellectually as a quality program.
