Abstract    :
              This grant will support the American participants in a  workshop on Applied
              Formal Methods to be held in Hyderabad,  India, in December 1996. The goal of
              the workshop is to  bring together several international experts from the U.S.,
               India, and elsewhere with the purpose of capturing the state  of the art in
              the technology and the state of practice in  the applications of formal
              methods. The workshop scope  includes the study of specification languages and
              logics and  verification methods, such as theorem proving, model  checking, and
              safety analysis.    Formal methods are increasingly applied to the core 
              algorithms in safety-critical systems and in the  verification of hardware
              circuit designs. A workshop of this  nature provides a timely means for
              developing a common  understanding of the capabilities and the potential 
              applications of these technologies. The organizers will edit  a technical
              report providing an up-to-date survey of applied  formal methods.  ***
