Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9633793  O'HANLON      The Center for Microcontamination Control
              studies issues related to cleaning, particle detection on surfaces,
              characterization of filters used in gas and water lines, measurement of
              bacteria in ultrapure water, and a number of problems related to contamination
              in ultraclean manufacturing equipment and environment.    This award provides
              funding for the last two years of the University of Arizona's
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Microcontamination Control.
               The Center continues to meet the renewal criteria requirements of the I/UCRC
              Program.
