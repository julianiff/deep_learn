Abstract    :
              ***  Slocum  9633485        In Phase I a concept was defined for a novel
              laser-pumped helium 4 magnetometer. The magnetometer employs a dual mode of
              operation (vector/scalar) to measure both the magnitude and direction of the
              geomagnetic field. The key technical component is a patented tunable diode
              laser (TDL) pumping source. The feasibility of measuring scalar fields with a
              resolution of 0.3 pT/~Hz, an order of magnitude better than conventional
              resonance magnetometers, was demonstrated with a laboratory breadboard. The
              concept of an omnidirectional single cell, single beam sensor was also
              demonstrated. A concept was also developed for extracting three-axis vector
              information from the single cell sensor. Phase I results will be used to
              design, fabricate, demonstrate and characterize a prototype portable
              Geomagnetic Vector Scalar Magnetometer (GVSM) including the sensor and
              electronics modules for high resolution scalar mode and three-axis vector mode
              in Phase II.        The GVSM instrument will be the first portable resonance
              magnetometer to provide vector components and high-resolution scalar field
              information. It will be state-of-the-art instrumentation for geomagnetic
              research and exploration. GVSM instrument would also find application in
              undersea surveillance, anti-shoplifting surveillance, mine countermeasures and
              planetary and space magnetic surveys.    ***
