Abstract    :
              9633725  Karson    Most of the ocean crust forms by the eruption of lavas on 
              the sea floor and the injection of lava into existing crust.  We can not
              observe this process, but we can study the rocks  affected by this process in
              ophiolites, in drill holes into  the ocean crust, and in faulted sections of
              ocean crust.  The Hess Deep, in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, is  the
              best example of the last type of locality for fast  spreading ocean ridges. 
              Two separate teams of scientists  have examined this section of ocean crust,
              but they  interpreted the observations quite differently.   The  proponenets
              wish to examine a broad section of the Hess Deep  crust to determine if it
              forms by episodes of crustal growth  followed by periods of faulting.
