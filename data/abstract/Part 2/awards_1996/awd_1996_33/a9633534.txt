Abstract    :
              9633534  Nabelek    On February 17, 1996, a great earthquake M=8.2 occurred
              along the  northwestern coast of Irian Jaya, Indonesia.  Initial reports show 
              wide-spread destruction of the coastal communities resulting from  strong
              shaking and a large tsunami.  This research, in cooperation  with Indonesian
              scientists, will take advantage of an extraordinary  opportunity to use
              advanced prrtable seismic instrumentation and  space-based geodesy to study the
              distortion due to the event,  including a rare opportunity to measure
              co-seismic slip  distribution during a great subduction earthquake.  It is also
              and  opportunity to study the interaction of parallel thrust and strike-  slip
              faults that display slip partitioning during the earthquake  sequence.  This
              part of the subduction fault was considered to be  largely inactive based on
              past seismicity, seismic reflection  profiles of the New Guinea trench, and
              recent geodetic  measurements.  The grant will support operation of a temporary
               seismograph network on the hanging wall of the thrust to map the  fault with
              aftershocks, and measurement of the static uplift of the  coastal areas by
              measuring coseismic sea level changes.   Reoccupation of the geodetic GPS site
              established in the area from  previous grants will be supported there.  This
              research is funded  under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research Program and
              is a  component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
