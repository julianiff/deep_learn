              Processing and Computational Aspects    This grant provides support for
              graduate students to continue their research with a center serving a strong
              graduate minority population, the NSF funded Center for Advanced Technology and
              Education   (NSF-CATE).  The research areas include real-time applications of
              computer vision, neural networks, and mulitidimensional and multispectral
              signal analysis and modeling, all under a highly distributed and parallel
              platform.  This support provides a strong basis for the development of
              visual/sensing techniques in a multi-dimensional and multispectral framework to
              address various dynamic and static phenomena viewed either through real-time
              confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, or a high-speed motion analyzer.  Modeling
              of dynamic phenomena which integrate time with the three spatial dimensions;
              real-time image analysis and interpretation; application of the fundamentals of
              the wavelet theory; and implementations of the functional principles of the
              hypercolumn theory of the visual cortex constitute key research endeavors under
              this proposal.  The important concepts of parallelism, data compression and
              high-speed data communication play a significant role in the aforementioned
              research goals.  The existing NSF-CATE infrastructure and the support of this
              grant allows for a significant impact to be made not only in enhancing the
              theoretical foundation of the outlined research goals, but in carrying-out key
              applications with our industrial partners, especially in biomedical
              diagnostics.  ***
