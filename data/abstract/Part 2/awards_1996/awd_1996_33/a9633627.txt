Abstract    :
              9633627  Tivey    Quantification of Upper Crustal Alteration and Ridge Flank 
              Hydrothermal Fluxes    Circulation of seawater through the ocean crust has a
              major effect  on the chemistry of the oceans. The composition of the water that
               exists from hot springs (hydrothermal vents) can tell us what  processes occur
              in the ocean crust to form the water. Key features  of the vent water,
              including the pH, the abundance of hydrogen and  hydrogen sulfide, and
              temperature, can tell what types of minerals  form in the ocean crust, and
              whether biologic activity is activity  is occurring there. Presently, however,
              pH, H2 and H2S can not be  measured because we have no sensors capable of
              making the  measurements at the high temperatures and pressures of the sea 
              floor. These investigators have a prototype instrument and plan to  develop,
              test, and deploy it to make these important measurements.
