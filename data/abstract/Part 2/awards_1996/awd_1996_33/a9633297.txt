Abstract    :
                  9633297  Little  The Commission of engineering and Technical Systems (CETS),
              a major  unit of the National Research Council, created the Board on 
              Infrastructure and the Constructed Environment (BICE in 1194.      The BICE
              brings together in an independent forum expertise from a  wide range of
              scientific, engineering, and social science  disciplines to address problems
              and issues in the areas of  technology, science, and public policy applied to
              urban systems;  public facilities; infrastructure systems and services; above 
              ground and underground construction; the relationship  between the  constructed
              and natural environments and their interaction with  human activities; the
              effects of natural hazards on constructed  facilities; and related issues of
              planning, design, construction,  management, surety, and use of the built
              environment.  The BICE  provides a unique structure to respond to specific
              requests from  government, or to act on its own initiative with public or
              private  sector support.  In pursuit of its goals, BICE plans to conduct on- 
              going strategic planning and oversee committee activities involving  studies,
              workshop, symposia, and a variety of information  dissemination activities.
