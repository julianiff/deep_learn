Abstract    :
              9633346  Glicksman    This study is directed toward developing a firm
              experimental  basis and deeper understanding of microstructural evolution  in
              two-phase alloys.  The focus is to integrate and test  several theories that
              describe microstructural coarsening  kinetics.  Specifically, "snap-shot"
              calculations, based on  distributions of point sources and sinks to represent 
              diffusional interactions in dilute microstructures, are  extended to higher
              volume fractions.  Kinetic studies on  binary alloys are pursued which are
              found to exhibit  temporal exponents in ultra-dense microstructures that, 
              curiously, decrease from the classical Ostwald ripening  value of 1/3 to a
              value of 1/4.  This is attributed to an as  yet unexplained kinetic behavior
              from the influence of  particle shape accommodation and strong spatial 
              correlations.  In summary, the research focuses both  theoretical and
              experimental efforts on integrating and  validating fundamental elements of
              coarsening theory to  achieve progress toward a more unified kinetic
              description  of microstructure evolution over the volume fraction range 0-  1. 
              %%%  The core subjects of this grant include determining kinetic  laws for
              alloys processed over the full range of  compositions and explaining them
              through basic kinetic  principles.  Properties of metal alloys depend on their
              microstructure,  and the microstructural behavior depends primarily on time, 
              temperature, and composition.  Temperature controls the rate  of atom
              diffusion, whereas, at a fixed temperature, the  average chemical composition
              determines the volume fraction  of dispersed phases, and, indirectly,
              establishes the  microstructural length scales for diffusion and interfacial 
              processes.  ***
