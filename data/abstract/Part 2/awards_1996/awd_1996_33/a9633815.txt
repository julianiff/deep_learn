Abstract    :
              9633815  SEBENS    The subtidal zones of temperate rocky shores are
              characterized by  complex  topography  and equally heterogeneous  distributions
               of  marine  algae  and invertebrate fauna.  The program  of  research  will 
              serve  to  continue long-term studies on  the  interactions  between  species
              and the effects of water movement on individual,  population    and   community
                processes   in    these    zones.  Investigations  larval dispersal will
              involve  a  combination  of  field  studies, laboratory investigations, and
              modelling of large  and  small  scale patterns.  The model chosen to  represent
               this  system  is  an  adaptation  of the `cellular  automata'  approach 
              developed for space-limited communities.
