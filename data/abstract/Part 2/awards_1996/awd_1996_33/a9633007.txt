Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program  will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University   of
              California Berkeley acquire a NMR.  This equipment will enhance   research in a
              number of areas including the following: (1)  application   of organic
              synthesis to biologial problems including helix nucleators and   macrocyclic
              peptidase inhibitors (2) synthesis and exploratory chemistry   of
              organometallic compounds and the investigations of their reaction   mechanisms
              (3)  organic synthesis methodology and total synthesis of   natural products
              including zaragozic acid and dictyoxetane  (4)    molecular recognition and
              catalysis in biological systems and   applications of these studies to the
              design and synthesis of new   molecules with novel biological properties, and
              (5)  exploratory   synthetic, structural and reactivity studies on novel
              inorganic systems   including transition metal-silicon chemistry and
              metal-mediated routes to   charge-transporting polymers.     Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists
              for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.    It is used to identify
              unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in
              solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR
              studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology
