Abstract    :
              9633064  Ramaley  This award provides support for a small workshop to consider
              the implications for NSF of changes underway in institutions of higher learning
              of all types, especially as they have implications for research and education
              in the biological sciences.  These changes reflect changes in the relationship
              of the government and academic institutions and, in turn, changes in the
              perceptions of the institutions and their faculty as they view of their own
              roles in society.  Although such change is normal and healthy, increasingly the
              impetus for change comes from lack of growth in support for faculty research by
              Federal agencies, increased emphasis on teaching by the largest institutions,
              and changing patterns of employment among graduates.  The effects of these
              changes on institutional policy and practice, and their implications for
              Federal agencies that fund research ald education in the biological sciences
              will be explored.  ***
