Abstract    :
                       9633543  Little  The Federal Facilities Council (formerly the Federal
              Construction  Council) is a cooperative association of federal agencies having 
              interests and responsibilities related to building science and  construction. 
              established in 1953 on the recommendation of a  committee of the National
              research Council, the Federal Facilities  Council (FFC) serves as a unique
              forum in which the sponsoring  agencies meet regularly among themselves and
              with other  organizations in the design and construction, maintenance, 
              management, operation, and evaluation of federal facilities.     Tangible
              products of the FFC include symposia, which usually are  held at the National
              Academy of Sciences, and reports.  Through the  years, the FFC has conducted or
              sponsored more than 150 formal  studies and investigations dealing with
              virtually every aspect of  the design, construction, and operation of
              facilities.  By helping  the agencies solve problems and improve the design of
              federal  facilities, the FFC has saved taxpayers untold millions of dollars.
