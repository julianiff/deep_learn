Abstract    :
              This award will support a variety of studies involving use of trace  metals (Ba,
              Cd, Sr) in benthic foraminiferal shells for application  to paleo-deep ocean
              circulation.  Previous work has shown that  trace metals and 13-C do not follow
              the same trends, although they  have all been used as tracers of deep-water
              type.  The project will  analyze live specimens from a variety of environments
              and compare  results with co-occurring dead specimens to determine effects of 
              early diagenesis; compare the same values with bottom water and  pore waters
              (measured by others) to determine how accurately the  organisms reflect ambient
              conditions; and examine changes in all  tracers in depth transects from the
              western (Ontong-Java Plateau)  and eastern (Cocos Ridge) tropical Pacific over
              the last glacial  cycle, in order to establish a first-order record of deep 
              circulation changes.
