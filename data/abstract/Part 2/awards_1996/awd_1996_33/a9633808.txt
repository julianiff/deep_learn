Abstract    :
              9633808  Reid    This grant provides $100,000 as two years partial  support of a
              technician's salary support who would  be responsible for operations,
              maintenance and  oversight of the UCLA thermal ionization mass  spectrometry
              facility and associated clean rooms.  This award is a Phase II technician
              support  proposal under the IF program and follows three  years of Phase I
              technician support which expires  on 7/31/96.  The lab manager will operate and
               maintain two TIMS housed at UCLA, a VG Sector 54-  30 with multiple collectors
              and an upgraded VG54E.  The Sector 54 instrument is dedicated to analyses  of
              Pb, Sr and Nd isotopes while the 54E is  reserved for isotope dilution
              measurements and  technique development.  Specific research to be  undertaken
              during the duration of this award will  include Th isotope studies of
              continental basalts  as indicators of their mantle source, exposure age  dating
              of geologic samples using cosmogenic  radionuclides (i.e. 14-C, 36-Cl, 26-Al
              and 10-Be)  and Sr isotope zonation studies of individual  phenocrysts from arc
              volcanics to investigate the  time scales of magmatic differentiation.  ***
