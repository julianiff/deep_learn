Abstract    :
              9633345  Gans     Over the past decades, the growth of immigrant entrepreneurs
              has made a distinct and consequential presence in most large U.S. cities.  The
              self-employment rate for some of these immigrants now exceeds that of the
              native born, particularly blacks.  Immigrant groups such as Jews and Koreans
              have been touted as "model minorities" who have become successful simply
              through hard work.  This Dissertation Improvement project investigates three
              areas:  (1) the ways in which immigrant entrepreneurs affect the employment
              opportunity structure for blacks by examining their hiring practices; (2) the
              ways in which social structures and processes help explain the greater success
              of self-employment among immigrants as compared to blacks; (3) the interracial
              and inter-ethnic relations between Jews, Koreans, and black. The sample
              population consists of 75 entrepreneurs and 75 customers from five largely
              black neighborhoods in two cities, New York and Philadelphia.  A comparative
              analysis will be conducted of Jewish, Korean and black entrepreneurs as well as
              black customers in low-income and middle-income neighborhoods to illuminate the
              interplay between the structural relationship of merchant and customer, race,
              ethnicity, class, culture and economic organization.  *****
