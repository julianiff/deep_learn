Abstract    :
              BANERJEE/9633514      ABSTRACT    The PIs propose to hold an interdisciplinary
              workshop that focuses on high-resolution magnetic techniques to address issues
              related to understanding the geomagnetic field and paleoclimate.  The workshop
              goals include:    1.  Constructing high-resolution geomagnetic paleointensity
              and paleodirectional databases as inputs for paleomagnetic and
              magneto-hydrodynamic modeling, especially of geomagnetic field reversals and
              secular variations.    2.  Establishing cross-validated rock magnetic proxy
              records of environmental and climate change for input to and validation of
              Global Change Models and Regional Change Models.
