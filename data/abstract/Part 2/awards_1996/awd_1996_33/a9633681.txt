Abstract    :
              9633681    McWilliams    In this project, the PI will lead a small research team
              to  investigate broadly the processes that cause large-scale, low-  frequency
              transient variability in the oceanic general circulation.  A hierarchy of
              modeling tools will be employed, ranging from  idealized models of the wind-
              and buoyancy-driven circulations, to  complete, global General Circulation
              Models, both with specified  surface forcing and in coupled configurations with
              atmospheric  models.  Further, the interpretations thus developed from the
              model  solutions would be tested by comparison with historical data sets,  and
              those from WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) that  contain the most
              information about the transient general  circulation.  Extensive collaborations
              with other universities and  laboratories will be maintained and expanded.
