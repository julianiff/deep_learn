Abstract    :
              9633774  Kent         This is a grant proposal for a 3-D multichannel seismic 
              reflection and tomography survey along the EPR at 9N to test  competing models
              of magmatic segmentation beneath a fast spreading  ridge. This would be the
              combine 3-D seismic reflection and  tomography experiment to be conducted along
              a MOR. Cots will be  share with the UK.
