Abstract    :
              This project will initiate long-term measurements of seafloor  strain on the
              south Cleft segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge.  The  measurements will be
              accomplished by arrays of instruments called  acoustic extensionmeters that
              measure distances to neighboring  instruments by precisely recording the round
              trip travel time of  acoustic pulses.  In this proof-of-concept phase, one 1.4
              km array  of 12 instruments will be installed at 100-200 m intervals using an 
              ROV during the first field season.  During the second and third  field seasons
              data will be retrieved from a surface ship.
