Abstract    :
              9633285  Fall        Plants are a significant source of non-methane hydrocarbons
              to the atmosphere,  yet the biochemical and physiological factors that
              influence these chemical emissions  from terrestrial vegetation are not well
              understood.  This project investigates the  production and emission of
              2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (methylbutenol) in ponderosa pine  and other pine
              species.  Methylbutenol is a trace atmospheric constituent that has been 
              measured in pine forests and is classified as an oxygenated hydrocarbons
              (oxHCs).  The oxHCs are hypothesized as a potentially significant group of
              compounds that is  important in the overall photochemistry  of the Earth s
              planetary boudary layer and  free troposphere.     In addition to study of the
              biochemical mechanism of  methylbutanol production in pine species, the project
              seeks to establish the  relationship of this compound to the enzymatic
              formation of other isoprenoid  chemicals synthesized by conifers.        
              Results from the project will provide improved understanding of the biological 
               and environmental factors that regulate the emission of natural oxHC to the 
              atmosphere.  This knowledge is necessary for developing predictive algorithms
              and  models that will estimate fluxes of oxHCs in response to environmental
              conditions and  to seasonal changes in plant metabolism.          ***
