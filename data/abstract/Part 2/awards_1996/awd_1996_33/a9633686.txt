Abstract    :
              To stimulate interest and activity in mathematical  research,  the National
              Science   Foundation each year supports a number  of NSF-CBMS Regional 
              Research Conferences   in the Mathematical Sciences.  Each five-day conference
              features  a distinguished lecturer   who delivers  ten lectures on a topic of
              important current  research in one sharply  focused   area of the mathematical
              sciences.  The lecturer subsequently  prepares an expository   monograph based
              upon these lectures, which is  normally published  by the American  
              Mathematical Society or the Society  for Industrial and Applied  Mathematics,
              or jointly by   the American  Statistical Association and the Institute of 
              Mathematical Statistics.  Certain   features differentiate these conferences
              from typical research  conferences.  These are: (1)   Focus on a single
              important and timely area  of research by a  leading practitioner, (2)  
              Continued effect and local  stimulation through regional emphasis,  (3) Panel
              review for   quality,  breadth, and timeliness, and (4) Published monographs 
              for a wider  audience.  This project will support an NSF-CBMS Regional Research
               Conference in the   Mathematical Sciences on the Numerical Analysis of 
              Hamiltonian Differential Equations to be held June 2-6, 1997  at Colorado
              School of Mines.  Professor J. M. Sanz-Serna of Universidad  de Valladolid will
              be the principal  lecturer.
