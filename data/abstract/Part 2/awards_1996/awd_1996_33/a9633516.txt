Abstract    :
              This research is on adiabatic logic design for very low energy consumption 
              circuits and systems.  The primary idea is to use principles of adiabatic 
              switching as the basis for circuit design.  Energy recovery using this notion
              is  a relatively new idea, although the concept of reversible logic and
              zero-energy  computing can be tracked back to he early 1970s, the attempt to
              realize the  concept in electronic circuits is a new endeavor.  An adiabatic
              logic, using both  fully reversible and partially reversible logic, is being
              developed.  It is based  on standard CMOS technology with a switching power
              supply.  Basic logic gates,  registers, and memories for recovered energy
              operations, are being developed.   Tools for power management, such as
              techniques to utilize the redundant signals  generated from reversible logic
              gates, are being developed.  The newly designed  circuits and the corresponding
              power supply are being fabricated and tested.
