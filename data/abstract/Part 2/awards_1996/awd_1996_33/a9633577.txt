Abstract    :
              The PI will investigate the nature of radar echoes that occur at altitudes well
              above those of thunderclouds, yet related to lightning discharges.  This
              high-altitude echo appears immediately after the impulsive occurrence of
              electromagnetic radiation emitted by a lightning discharge.  Radio signals can
              be retrieved from this area of interest, promising the potential availability
              of new electrodynamical information, and this project will determine the nature
              of these radar echoes and assess their informational capability.  Subvisual
              optical flashes (red sprites, blue jets, and elves) occur in the same altitude
              region, confirming that electrical coupling processes are operating.  The PI
              will draw diagnostic information from radar echoes, complementary to that
              obtained from optical and spectrographic measurements to further constrain the
              possible theoretical models for this phenomena.
