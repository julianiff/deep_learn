Abstract    :
              9633243  Stryker    This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement research examines
              social factors affecting educational choices of academically talented women at
              their initial stages of pursuing careers in science and technology.  Despite
              efforts to the contrary, proportions of women entering science and technology
              continue to decline, and academically talented women drop out of these areas at
              higher rates than men.  This problem is explored via identity theory, which
              asserts that academic and career choice are impacted by self-organization.  The
              sample consist of participants in summer programs for high school students in
              science, mathematics and engineering.  Data will be collected through a survey
              of 1,000 male and female students (before program attendance and after
              enrollment in college), ethnographic observations at one summer program site,
              and follow-up face-to-face interviews.  These data will be studied to see how
              social relationships organize students' identities and affect students' choices
              and how gender-related variation in "future scientist" identity formation and
              maintenance impacts educational and career choices.  Major funding for this
              three-year project has been provided by the Sloan Foundation.  NSF funding will
              be used primarily to compensate respondents, to conduct follow-up interviews
              with students in the ethnographic component, and to support data entry
              activities.  ***  ??
