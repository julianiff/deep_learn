Abstract    :
              9633732  Buck       The tectonic force available to drive rifting is  estimated
              to be as much as an order of magnitude below the  yield strength of intact
              lithosphere according to standard  models. Detailed numerical models of rifting
              will be  developed that include dike instrusion with the aim of  expaining the
              first-order features of continental rifts and  rifted margins with the simplest
              possible self-consistent  models will be used to explore the time evolution of 
              lithospheric strength, subsidence, and surface deformation  in rift zones,
              under different assumptions of magma supply  and rifting rates.  ***
