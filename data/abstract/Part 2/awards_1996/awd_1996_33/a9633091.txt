Abstract    :
              9633091  POPP      The isotopic carbon composition of the marine phytoplankton 
              reflects not only the isotopic composition of seawater but also the 
              environmental conditions under which photosynthesis occurs.  Oceanographers and
              paleontologists are particularly interested in  how phytoplankton isotopic
              composition is related to ambient  temperature so that fossil organic matter
              preserved in marine  sediments might be used to infer climatic conditions in
              the  geologic past.  Because variety of factors is responsible for the  algal
              isotopic composition actually found, there is a need to  understand their
              individual and collective impact.    This research team from the University of
              Hawaii and the Scotia  Institute of Oceanography will use laboratory and field
              studies to  examine how conditions such as physiological state, growth rate, 
              and environmental conditions affect carbon isotopic 'fractionation'  by the
              phyplankton.  The laboratory studies will involve careful  culture work with
              two algal species, and the results will be  compared to samples collected from
              the water column and sediments  of the Arabian Sea and at the Hawaiian Ocean
              Time-Series station  near Oahu using a mathematical model relating various
              physiological  and environmental factors to algal isotopic composition.
