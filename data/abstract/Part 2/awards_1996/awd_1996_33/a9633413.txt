Abstract    :
              9633413  ROBLES  Large scale manipulations of prey populations will  be combined
              with tagging of individual predators to investigate  possible predator
              population responses to changing prey availabilities. The predator is the
              intertidal sea star, Pisaster ochraceus, and the prey are mussels, Mytilus
              spp., barnacles, Balanus and Semibalanus spp., and other sedentary
              invertebrates. Hypothetical predator responses include changes in rates of
              mortality,    indeterminate growth, and alongshore movement. The data provide
              insights into mechanisms of predatory regulation within local  populations of
              the larger metapopulation. The research will be conducted at Western Canadian
              Marine Biological Laboratories in British Columbia. Most of the field work will
              be done in summer, when the sea stars actively forage. A brief period of 
              observation is included in winter to maintain experiments and describe the
              disposition of predator and prey populations in the    season when the former
              is inactive. In addition to scientific discovery, this Research at
              Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project seeks to enhance science education and
              research training for the diverse student body of California State University
              at Los Angeles. Outstanding undergraduate and masters level students will
              recieve researech experience at the field location and Cal State LA.  ***
