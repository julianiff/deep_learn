Abstract    :
              This starter grant award to the University of Delaware supports the   research
              of Professor Eugene G. Mueller.  The research is an   investigation of the
              mechanism and structure of the enzyme myo-inositol   oxygenase, whose catalytic
              function arises from a non-heme iron in a   protein environment.  Techniques
              employed include nuclear magnetic   resonance and Moessbauer spectroscopies;
              rapid freeze quench methods;   site-directed mutagenesis; and steady-state and
              rapid kinetic studies   including substrate analogs, inhibitors, and the
              determination of isotope   effects.  In addition to the novel chemistry to
              emerge from these studies, the   enzyme myo-inositol oxygenase is of
              physiological interest.  Diabetic   animals show a marked decrease in its
              acitivity, and inhibition of the   enzyme leads to rapid kidney failure. 
              Inositol phosphates play a key   role in cellular signaling, errors in which
              mediate oncogenesis.  Thus,   non-heme, iron-containing enzymes are vital in
              life-sustaining biological   processes.
