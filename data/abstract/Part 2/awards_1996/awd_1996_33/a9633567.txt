Abstract    :
                      This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), jointly  funded by the
              Theory of Computing (TOC) Program, CCR and by  the Informations Technologies
              Office, DARPA, addresses  problems in the new area of Biomolecular/DNA Based 
              Computation; in particular, in the area of parallel molecular  computation
              (PMC), massively parallel computation at the  molecular scale.   The goals of
              this SGER project include:(1)  Exploring possible implementations of PMC;(2)
              Assessing the  feasibility of the PMC implementations; (3) Empirically 
              determining the parameters of performance (e.g., time,  volume, etc.) of PMC
              for some set of applications;(4) Doing  trial recombinant DNA implementations
              of such key operations  as: (a) parallel memory read and write, and (b)
              parallel  arithmetic on small integers;(5) Planning a study of the 
              implementation of a biological application of PMC with small  or at most
              moderate I/O and volume requirements.  In  addition, one of the goals of this
              SGER award is to foster  to facilitate a multidisciplinary effort between the
              Computer  Science Department, the Duke Center for Molecular Diversity  and the
              Microbiology Department of Duke University.***
