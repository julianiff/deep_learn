Abstract    :
              This Ocean Sciences Instrumentation Development project  will continue
              development of a submersible chemical analyzer (Scanner) that can be widely
              used for oceanographic studies. The new  instrument will be suitable for
              deployment on profiling instruments or research submersibles, as well as on
              platforms such as benthic flux chambers and deep towed vehicles, and on
              moorings for longer term (up to four-month) deployments.  The proposed design
              is simple and flexible, which will allow it to be used for both
              macro-nutrients, as well as trace elements.  This new generation of the
              existing Scanner  requires a new pumping system and other refinements. 
              Micro-solenoid pumps will be used that are smaller and lighter than previous
              peristaltic pumps and they can be individually controlled.  The flexibility of
              individual microprocessor control of each flow stream allows variable flow
              rates (including no flow) for each reagent, sample and standard.  This will
              facilitate assay optimization and make it possible to access several different
              analyses on the same Scanner system.  The goal of this fourth generation
              scanner is a substantially simpler and more robust system than previous
              versions that can be used in a greater variety of studies.  There is a clear
              need for improved instruments capable of performing chemical measurements in
              situ.  The science plans for many large scale research projects call for this
              capability.
