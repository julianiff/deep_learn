Abstract    :
              OCE 96-33655  Nof    The project will apply an analytical approach to the
              investigation of  eddy formation in the connecting regions between basins. The
              approach   will allow nonlinear, periodic flows to be integrated over a control
                volume in a manner analogous to that used for steady flows. This   greatly
              simplifies the problem so that important features of the   eddies, such as
              their size and frequency of generation, can be   determined without resolving
              the details of the generation process   itself. The investigation will
              initially consider simplified   analytical models, and later proceed to more
              realistic, two-layer,   numerical modeling. Results are expected to complement
              ongoing   observational and modeling studies of the Agulhas and Brazil current 
               systems.
