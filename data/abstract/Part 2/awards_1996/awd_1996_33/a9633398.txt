Abstract    :
              9633398  Sinton      The East Pacific Rise near 17 S is the fastest mid-ocean 
              spreading ridge, but the thickness of  volcanic rocks  appears to be the same
              as on slowly spreading ridges. Magma  must be supplied from the mantle,
              therefore, at a much  greater rate than at other ridges. This aspect suggests
              that  there must be numerous eruptions and a nearly constant  source of magma
              storage. The frequent eruptions and rapid  sedimentation rate in this area make
              it possible to  determine relative ages of frequent eruptions. The Pis wish  to
              determine the frequency and size of lava flows, which  could help to determine
              the rate at which magma is supplied  to the surface.
