Abstract    :
              9633230  Mayer    A pore protection hypothesis will be tested, provide a
              mechanistic  basis for the observed patterns of organic carbon. Relationships 
              between organic matter and mineral surfaces will be developed by:    (1)
              Assessing the extent of organic matter coverage on mineral  grains. Is organic
              carbon localized in small areas or is it widely  dispersed? Wide dispersal
              implies that major fraction must reside  in small pores.  This question will be
              tested by completing  development of a promising new method based on the   of
              gas  adsorption onto mineral surfaces.  Completion work will focus on  the
              nature of naked mineral surfaces, identifying variations that  derive from
              mineralogy, microtopography, and source area;  (2) Determining if natural
              organic matter resides preferentially  inside small mesopores, by careful
              examination of the effects of  removal of organic coatings on the size
              distribution of pores. This  test will also involve the reverse process of
              adding artificial  organic coatings to uncoated mineral grains, providing
              insight into  the localization and mechanism of organic matter sorption.  (3)
              Testing if these small mesopores on mineral grains can indeed  exclude
              hydrolytic enzymes, by performing a series of size-  exclusion and adsorption
              experiments.    These approaches will be carried out on a wide variety of
              sediments  from around the world. In addition to testing the pore hypothesis, 
              results from this project will have important implications for  carbon cycling,
              mineral-water interactions, and pollutant cycling.
