Abstract    :
              9633161  Marsden    The proposed research lies in the area of geometric
              mechanics. It has to do with laying a theoretical foundation for various
              aspects of classical mechanics. Nonholonomic systems with symmetry are to be
              investigated as an application of the ideas of Lagrangian reduction. Integrable
              systems and solitons will be pursued with a view towards certain applications
              in control dynamics. Bifurcations in Hamiltonian systems will be investigated
              in the context of singular reduction. Geometry of control systems will also be
              studied.    Geometric mechanics aims to formulate theories and problems in
              classical mechanics in a mathematically rigorous setting. There have been
              several recent successes of geometric mechanics. The falling cat example, where
              the cat executes a complete re-orientation without exerting any angular
              momentum, has now been explained using the idea of a connection - a connection
              is a mathematical notion originally introduced to study so called principal
              bundles in differential geometry. The proposed research will further pursue
              these theoretical ideas as well as consider possible applications in such areas
              as control theory and robotics.
