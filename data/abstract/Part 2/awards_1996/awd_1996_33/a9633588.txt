Abstract    :
              9633588  McCorkle    This project will compare live and recently-dead (core-top)
               specimens of epibenthic foraminifera from depth transects on the  Ontong-Java
              Plateau. Previous work indicates a systematic decrease  of incorporated trace
              metals and 13C with increasing depth and with  decreasing saturation state of
              calcite. These trends could reflect  either an effect of dissolution, or
              fractionation during growth  under varying saturation state. The effects can be
              discriminated by  live/dead comparison; if there is no different then
              dissolution  does not play a role.
