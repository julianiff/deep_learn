Abstract    :
              9633276    Jenkins    In this project, the PI will analyze a series of water
              samples  obtained in March-April, 1995 in the Seas of Japan and Okhotsk by  Dr.
              S. Riser, of the University of Washington, aboard a Russian  research vessel. 
              Specific attention would be paid to analysis for  Helium-3 and Tritium. 
              Results would be used as circulation model  constraints, to estimate oxygen
              consumption rates, and to infer  rates of export production within the basins. 
              These seas are  thought to be the principal sources of ventilation of North
              Pacific  Intermediate Waters (NPIW), and hence important for a variety of 
              oceanographic and climatic reasons.  Results would be useful in  providing
              boundary conditions for tracer models of the entire North  Pacific, adding
              value to the Pacific tracer program of the World  Ocean Circulation Experiment.
