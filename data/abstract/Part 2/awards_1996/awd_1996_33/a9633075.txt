Abstract    :
              Over the past decade, artificial intelligence concepts and techniques have been
              productively applied to diverse aspects of manufacturing decision-making,
              ranging from product and process development, to production management, to
              process diagnosis and quality control.  Artificial intelligence techniques will
              continue to impact design and manufacturing.  In fact, they are an important - 
              even necessary - part of the dreams shared by concepts such as lean
              manufacturing, agile manufacturing, virtual manufacturing, computer-integrated 
              manufacturing and design.  Because artificial intelligence is still a field in
              which there is much fundamental research required to bring to fruition exciting
              developments that will prove useful in these fields and because this research
              might as well be focused on the most productive areas, it is a good time to
              bring together experts and practitioners in both artificial intelligence and
              manufacturing, to bridge gaps between problem and solution perspectives, build
              better mutual understanding of important research challenges and technical
              potential in the field, break down cultural barriers that now exist, and foster
              future interaction and collaboration between the two communities.    Together,
              manufacturing and artificial intelligence researchers and practitioners will
              work to facilitate the realization of truly intelligent manufacturing systems.
