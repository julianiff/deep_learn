Abstract    :
              9633784  YOUNG  Most deep-sea animals are capable of continuous reproduction,
              but a few have annual reproductive cycles.  This is a paradox, since the
              environmental cues used by shallow-water marine animals for synchronizing their
              reproductive cycles (e.g., changing daylength, lunar period, or increasing
              temperature) are generally absent from the deep sea. In many parts of the world
              ocean, however, there is a seasonally variable cycle of detrital rain. For
              example, in much of the North Atlantic, a seasonal pulse of phytoplankton
              arrives at the sea floor several weeks after the surface phytoplankton bloom.
              It has been proposed that deep-sea animals use this pulse either to entrain
              their reproductive cycles, or to provide the energy needed for a reproductive
              event. To date, however, there is no experimental evidence in support of this
              hypothesis. In this project, laboratory experiments will be used to determine
              if several species of large bathyal invertebrates can shift their reproductive
              seasons or increase their reproductive output in response to phytodetrital
              pulses.  For comparative purposes, both seasonal and aseasonal breeders will be
              used, and also species with fast and slow mechanisms of egg production.  ***
