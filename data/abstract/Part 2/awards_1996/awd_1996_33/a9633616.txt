Abstract    :
              This project will analyze hydrothermal samples previously collected  from 9
              degrees north on the East Pacific Rise, and from the North  Cleft segment and
              Axial seamount on the Juan de Fuca Ridge.  The  common theme among these
              hydrothermal vent sistes is that all three  are associated with active manga
              chambers.  Gas chromatographic  methods will be used to analyze the samples for
              carbon dioxide,  methane, hydrogen, nitrogen, and argon.
