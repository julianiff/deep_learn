Abstract    :
              Abstract  ATM-9633517  Werner, Al  Mount Holyoke College  Title: Assessment of
              Pre-Late Wisconsin-Kettle Basins: Potentially          Long Records of
              Environmental Change, Denali National Park          and Preserve, Alaska   
              This SGER awards supports the exploration of 2 small lakes in the  Denali area
              of Alaska for their potential to yield a continuous  environmental record of
              the last 60,000 years.  Field work will  include the documentation of basin
              bathymetry, structure of the  sediment fill through acoustic profiling, and
              nature of the  sediment infill.  If successful, these basins could provide a
              key  record of paleoclimate for the glacial period.
