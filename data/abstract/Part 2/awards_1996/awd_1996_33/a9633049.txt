Abstract    :
              McClean      OCE-9633049      Observations from the World Ocean Circulation
              Experiment (WOCE) will be    compared with the output of a very realistic high
              resolution global ocean    circulation model by extracting model fields
              co-located in both time and space    with the observations and conducting
              identical analyses the statistics of the    ocean circulation. In regions where
              the model simulation behaves with an    acceptable degree of realism as
              determined by these comparisons, a conceptual    synthesis of model output and
              observations will be used for interpretative and    dynamical studies and to
              extend the temporal and spatial coverage of the    WOCE observations. In
              particular, seasonal, interannual and some aspect of    decadal variability
              will be examined using the validated fields. In cases where    the model is
              found to be lacking, explanations for the deficiencies will be    determined
              and improvements suggested for implementation in future    simulations.
