Abstract    :
              9633600  Zink    Under the Planning Grant Guidelines The Invention Factory
              Science  Center (IFSC) develop "The Invention Factory Science Center Phase  One
              Plan".  This new science center is the central component of  mixed-use
              redevelopment effort at the 45-acre Roebling Industrial  complex in Trenton,
              New Jersey.  Phase One includes the development  of a 3200 sq. ft. visitor's
              center which is scheduled to open in  the Spring of 1997.  The IFSC will
              develop "Pathways to Science and  Technology: An Informal Science Learning
              System, which is to be an  innovative, interactive computer-based system of
              activities  designed to stimulate self-directed and continuous learning.  It 
              will have a strong regional/community base, will leverage resources  from local
              academic, industrial, and educational institutions, and  will be disseminated
              broadly via state-of-the-art  telecommunications technology.    The planning
              activities will include front-end evaluation of the  needs and interests of the
              community, meetings of the advisory  committee, the development of plans for
              the "Pathfinders" software  program, and development of plans for the overall
              evaluation of the  project.   t the end of the twelve-month planning period
              they will  have designs and cost-estimates for the interactive activities and 
              a general plan for the Visitor center.  The value that this  planning grant
              adds to their effort is support to bring nationally  recognized leaders in
              exhibit development and informal learning to  the planning sessions.
