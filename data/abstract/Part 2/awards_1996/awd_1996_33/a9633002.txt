Abstract    :
              9633002  Wodtke   This project will investigate the fate of highly vibrationally
              excited molecular oxygen under conditions which are intended to simulate those
              occurring in the upper stratosphere.  The goal of the project is to further
              understand ozone formation and destruction processes in this region,  in
              particular, the hypothesized formation of ozone from the reaction of highly
              vibrationally excited (v> 26) oxygen with other oxygen molecules.  Through a
              series of laboratory experiments, the PI will investigate reaction processes
              that lead to stratospheric ozone formation.  The PI will construct a new
              experimental apparatus that involves Time-of-Flight Mass Spectroscopy that will
              be configured and optimized for the detection of chemical reaction products of
              highly vibrationally excited oxygen reactant species.  Results from the project
              will advance what is known concerning the chemical and physical properties of
              molecular oxygen present in the stratosphere, and provide increased
              understanding of factors influencing stratospheric ozone concentrations.  ***
