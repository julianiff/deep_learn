Abstract    :
              Williams/Abstract            The objectives of this research are the behavior of
              the Earth s  naturally occurring Schumann resonances on three different scales.
               At a  global scale, the objective is to understand the pronounced variability
              of  background Schumann resonance intensity and how this variability is 
              influenced by the temperature-related conditional instability in the 
              troposphere.  At the mesoscale, the objective is to understand the 
              meteorological conditions associated with the production of energetic  positive
              ground flashes that produce ELF Q-bursts.  We are now able to  map these events
              on a global basis from single-station observations and  this may enable an
              investigation of the global diurnal variation of  mescoscale convective
              systems.  This variation may be quite distinct from  the traditional diurnal
              behavior of the global circuit. At the local lightning  scale, the objective is
              to understand the nature of the continuing current  and the charge transfer to
              ground associated with the sprite-producing  positive ground flashes.
