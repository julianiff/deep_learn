Abstract    :
              This project will analyze a set of OBH seismic data collected off  the margin of
              central Chile where the aseismic Juan Fernandez Ridge  is being subducted. 
              Velocity structure will be determined along  two transects normal to the coast
              and in a grid sited over a  possible buried seamount under the Valparaiso
              Basin.  The data will  be used to (1) test whether there is a seamount and if
              so whether  it acts as an "asperity" which may have served as a focus for the 
              1985 earthquake and (2) determine the 3D shape and velocity  structure of the
              accretionary wedge and lithosphere to constrain  sediment porosity and
              elasticity of the subducting plate.
