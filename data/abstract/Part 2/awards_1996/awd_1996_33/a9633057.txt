Abstract    :
              OCE 96-33057  Becker    The project will use two types of general circulation
              models to   investigate effects of topography and stratification on western  
              boundary currents which cannot be addressed by quasi-gestrophic   models. The
              first model is governed by primitive equations, but   constrained to be
              barotropic. Finite difference solutions for the   case of sidewalls which
              transition smoothly to zero depth through   a "continental shelf" will be
              compared to the standard case of   vertical sidewalls. The second model will
              also incorporate   sloping sidewalls, but will be stratified. Vertical modes
              will be   used to avoid numerical difficulties where layer interfaces  
              intersect the boundaries. The results will clarify dynamical   processes
              controlling wind driven flow in numerical general   circulation models.
