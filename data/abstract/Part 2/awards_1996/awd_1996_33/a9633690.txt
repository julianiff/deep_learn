Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9633690   Cochran, Jorgensen, Black, Kraus      This proposal is
              for a series of workshops and working sessions to coordinate the scientific
              data and results of the project "Social Transitions in the North: Alaska and
              the Russian Far East" (OPP-9496351). The Principal Investigators of the
              original project, Steven McNabb, Alexander Pika, and William Richards, died
              while doing fieldwork in the Russian Far East. They were completing the fourth 
              year of a study examining social change and health in Native villages in
              Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, Chukotka and Kamchatka. The Alaska Native Science
              Commission (ANSC) will serve as successor institution and coordinate the
              activities of a senior advisory group which will oversee the completion of the
              project. This group consists of Patricia Cochran, Executive Director, Alaska
              Native Science Commission, Professor Lydia Black, University of Alaska
              Fairbanks, Professor Joseph Jorgensen, University of California Irvine, and
              Professor Robert Kraus, University of Kentucky. The ANSC will convene the
              meetings, facilitate the archiving of project materials, manage the budget, and
              help produce a final report.
