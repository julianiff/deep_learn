Abstract    :
                9633011 Weimer  This research project aims to gain fundamental understanding
              of the relationship between interface quality and carrier wave function overlap
              in quantum well semiconductor structures.  The approach is to examine the
              influence of Al(Ga)Sb barriers on the interband coupling in model
              InAs/Ga(In)Sb/Al(Ga)Sb structures that comprise the active regions in type-II
              quantum well and quantum cascade lasers.  Scanning tunneling microscopy(STM)
              and spectroscopy(STS) will be used to provide fundamental data on interface
              quality and will be related to carrier wave function overlap.  The insights
              developed from analysis of the STM and STS data will be used in MBE growth and
              subsequent processing studies to optimize material quality, growth sequence,
              design and fabrication of type-II mid-IR lasers. %%% The research will
              contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level of
              technological relevance to several aspects of advanced electronic/photonic
              devices and integrated circuitry.  Additionally, the knowledge and
              understanding gained from this research project is expected to contribute in a
              general way to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by
              providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing
              improved materials, and materials combinations.  An important feature of the
              program is the integration of research and education through the training of
              students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***
