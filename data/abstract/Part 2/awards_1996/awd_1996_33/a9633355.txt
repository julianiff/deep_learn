Abstract    :
              9633355  Gieskes  This award allows the participation of Dr. Joris Gieskes of
              Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, on a planned
              research cruise in the vicinity of Hawaii to sample sub-crustal water at an
              existing seafloor borehole.  In addition to sampling and analysing the
              subseafloor fluids to examine changes in properties since drilling in 1991,
              this researcher will carry out detailed physical logs of the borehole.  The
              overall objective of this research is to understand the movement of fluids
              within the earth's crust.  This project provides important information on the
              borehole environment for the separately-supported activity, coordinated between
              Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and
              the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, to emplace and test
              seismometers in this borehole to record earthquakes, testing methods of
              expanding the Global Seismic Network into the marine environment.    ***
