Abstract    :
              9633114  Collins  This project supports researchers from Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts to conduct a series of experiments
              at two sites in the North Atlantic Ocean to understand the processes involved
              in growth of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  Specifically, the investigators will
              measure the reflected and refracted arrivals of seismic energy from small
              explosive charges near the bottom over sections of the mid-ocean ridge
              spreading center which have known, previously sampled, rock compositions.  They
              will then apply the results of their seismic experiment to a) identify and b)
              map rock types across these two sections of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, to test
              existing models for subsurface ridge structure.  The technique will, if
              successful, provide the first 3-dimensional map of the structure of a
              slow-spreading mid-ocean ridge, which is predicted to differ in several key
              aspects from the faster-spreading mid-ocean ridge systems previously studied in
              this manner in the Pacific Ocean.  The experiment will, also, provide the first
              field test of the use of high resolution seismic velocity data to discriminate
              among gabbros, serpentinites and basalts in the upper kilometer of an active
              spreading center.  Again, if successful this will provide an opportunity to map
              regions of unknown surface lithology using the seismic technique alone.  ***
