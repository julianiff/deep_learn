Abstract    :
              9633415  Fryer  A major focus of marine geoscience research is elucidating
              global  chemical mass balance for dissolved species in the oceans. A major 
              uncertainty in these calculations is an estimate for fluxes  associated with
              fluid flow through convergent margins. For some  chemical species this omission
              is significant. Before better  estimates of global mass balances can be
              determined, the chemical  composition of venting fluids from subduction zones
              must be  determined and the diagentic reactions that form these fluids must  be
              understood. Recent work on this problem has focussed on  subduction zones
              characterized by large accumulations of  underthrust sediment. In such regions,
              however, the diagentic  reactions in the thick sediment sequences may obscure
              the primary  signal of fluids from the underthrusting ocean crust.    The
              present recommended project will focus on fluid flow and  chemistry of fluids
              from the Mariana forearc region. Sediment  accretion is minimal in this area,
              and study of fluid flow and  chemistry should provide an excellent guide to
              understanding  primary chemical signature of fluids derived from the ocean
              crust.  A combination of remote vehicle sampling, coring from surface ship, 
              and measurements of sediment heat fluid and pore fluids will  provide data from
              three areas in the Marianas where fluid flow  appears to be channelized along
              fault zones. In addition to  addressing significant scientific questions, the
              project will  provide important background information for proposed ocean 
              drilling in this region.  ***
