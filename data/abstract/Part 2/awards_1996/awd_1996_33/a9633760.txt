Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  OPP-9633760  WILK/ZIMMER    A definite relationship has been found
              between the commercialization of archaeological finds and the destruction of
              archaeological sites. In spite of worldwide public attention to archaeological
              heritage preservation, site destruction continues to increase. The objective of
              this dissertation study is to analyze the rules, values and practices that
              affect the use of archaeological resources on Saint Lawrence Island in the
              Bering Straits of Alaska. The Native village of Gambell is a unique case of a
              legal archaeological market. Many residents recover and sell marketable
              artifacts as a means of meeting subsistence needs in a cash economy. Other
              residents oppose this practice. This project addresses the dilemma of selling
              cultural heritage property, protecting archaeological resources, and the clash
              between cultural resource managers and local people with limited sources of
              cash income.
