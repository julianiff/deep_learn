Abstract    :
              9633418  Morgan   The objectives of this project are to describe the propagation
              and development characteristics of midlatitude upper tropospheric mobile
              troughs ("short waves"), characterize the basic state flow within which short
              waves propagate, and identify the disturbances antecedent to short wave
              formation and determine their relationship to the background atmospheric flow. 
              The research will utilize data from the North American radiosonde and
              rawinsonde network, analysis and forecast fields from the National Centers for
              Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational weather forecast models, and
              possibly data from an upcoming international experiment known as FASTEX (Fronts
              and Atlantic Storm Track Experiment).  The NCAR limited area nonhydrostatic
              mesoscale model (MM5) as well as simpler quasi-geostrophic models will be
              employed to help elucidate the interactions between the basic state and the
              short wave precursors.   The results from this research should have practical
              application in improving short and medium range weather forecasts.  In
              addition, they may provide some guidance in the deployment of adaptive
              observing systems for weather prediction.  ***
