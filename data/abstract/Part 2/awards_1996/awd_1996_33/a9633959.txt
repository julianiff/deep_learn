Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9633959    The proposed project is to investigate wetting and
              dewetting of a flat surface by a thin liquid film.  Three cases will be
              investigated: (1) the advance of a falling thin film with countercurrent air
              flow; (2) the dryout of revulets, and (3) the formation of dry spots on a
              heated plate.  Extensive experiments will be conducted to observe the wetting
              and dewetting process for each of these cases using a digital imaging system. 
              The dryout front will be measured for different parameter ranges.  The
              experimental data will be combined with theoretical results to develop models
              for describing the wetting and dewetting phenomena.  The theoretical part of
              the project will include both analytical and numerical studies.  Instability
              analyses will be performed for cases that are amenable to analytical treatment.
               Otherwise, numerical computations will be carried out.
