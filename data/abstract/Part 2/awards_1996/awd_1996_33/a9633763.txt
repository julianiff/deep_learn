Abstract    :
              Although citation flows among papers constitute one of the critical stratifying
              mechanisms in science, insufficient attention has been paid to the determinants
              of such flows.  Previous research has studied citation flows in terms of
              characteristics of cited articles, but has ignored the role played by
              characteristics of the citing articles.  This project extends previous research
              by viewing the citation process as a dyadic relationship that simultaneously
              encompasses characteristics of both citing and cited articles.  Using data on
              two research areas, one in astrophysics and one in economics, this research
              will develop a network analytic approach to analyze all of the possible
              citation links between the papers in the area.  This project will extend our
              understanding of stratification in science by illuminating the allocation of
              credit at the micro level of the citation.  In addition, by adopting a
              comparative framework, it may produce further information about similarities or
              differences between the physical and social sciences.
