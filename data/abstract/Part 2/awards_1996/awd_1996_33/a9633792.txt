Abstract    :
              9633792  Synolakis  This action is to support the participation of U.S.
              researchers  in the international effort to learn from the February 17, 1996 
              Irian Jaya earthquake and tsunami, in order to gather and study  perishable
              inundation data.  The participants will join the  International Tsunami Survey
              Team which has surveyed six of the  1992-1994 worldwide events, resulting in a
              small but valuable  database of inundation data.    On February 17, 1996, a
              strong earthquake shook Biak Island off  Irian Jaya in East Indonesia.  The
              earthquake-generated tsunami  waves propagated to Japan, where the measured
              height of the  attenuated waves was approximately one meter, with a reported 
              wave height on reaching the west coast of the United States of up  to 7cm.   
              The US participants will: (1) measure maximum penetration points  (maximum
              runup) at different locations, (2) attempt to estimate  tsunami inundation
              velocities, and (3) interview eyewitnesses to  determine the nature and number
              of runup waves observed.  Runup  data are highly perishable, given that
              reconstruction efforts  start a few days, if not hours, after the event.  Even
              in remote  areas, storms and wind-generated waves may alter the topography  or
              scatter the debris line which is used for estimating the  location of the
              penetration points.  It is for this reason that  travel to the site must occur
              as soon as possible after the event  to document the coastal effects of a
              damaging tsunami.    Accurate information of the runup height distribution will
              allow  a better definition of the tectonic source motion, which in turn  will
              permit the calibration of a source model for future use.  It  is anticipated
              that the team will be able to obtain profile data  in the survey which will be
              used both to augment the modeling,  and also to evaluate how important beach
              topography is for first-  order predictions.  ***
