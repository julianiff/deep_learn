Abstract    :
              9633381  Saleeby    This grant provides $149,829 as partial support of three
              years of  a technician's salary.  The technician will be responsible for 
              oversight, operation and maintenance of the Caltech radiogenic  and noble gas
              mass spectrometery laboratories.  This is a Phase I  technician support
              proposal under the EAR/IF technician support  sub-program.  Technical support
              at these laboratories will allow  continued and productive research by this
              strong and well  supported group including studies utilizing helium 
              thermochronology as applied to tectonic investigations of the  Peninsular
              Ranges and the Sierra Nevadas, Ar/Ar geochronologic  studies of deformational
              events near the Gulf of California, and  Sm/Nd isotope systematics applied to
              dating of garnet bearing  metamorphic rocks from the western margin of the
              Cordillera.  ***
