Abstract    :
              9633675  Narang, Hira  Letton, Alan    Tuskegee University    CISE Minority
              Institutions Infrastructure:  The Establishment of Infrastructure for High
              Performance Computing Program (HPCP) for Teaching and Research at Tuskegee   
              This minority institution infrastructure grant proposes to establish research
              infrastructure in High Performance Computing (HPC) involving students and
              faculty of Tuskegee University with scientists and researchers of Oak Ridge and
              Argonne National Laboratories.  To sustain and invigorate the proposed research
              infrastructure, three supportive components are proposed:     - Computing
              Facilities Component   - Education and Training Component, and   - Summer
              Programs Component    The computing facilities component proposes to provide
              the high performance computing facilities consisting of workstations and
              high-end PCs, as well as necessary software tools, to support both applicative
              and fundamental research in high performance computing.    The Education and
              Training component proposes to develop students and faculty interests and
              skills in high performance computing methodology through structured courses,
              seminars, workshops, and hands-on training in the usage of high performance
              computing machinery at national laboratories.    The Summer Programs Components
              envisages bringing high school students, from 9th through 12th grade levels in
              varying periods of summer, and train them in problem solving as well as
              internet access and multi-media applications.  The additional objective of this
              component is to intensively involve undergraduate/graduate students and faculty
              in high performance computing research through summer programs at national
              labs.  ***
