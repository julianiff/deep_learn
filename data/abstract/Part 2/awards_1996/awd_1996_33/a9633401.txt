Abstract    :
                9633401  Paffenhofer    This project will investigate the ability of doliolids
               (Tunicata, Thaliacea) to control the abundance of protozoa  and free-spawning
              calanoid copepods. Pelagic tunicate  feeding rates have been difficult to
              quantify, particularly  for Thaliacea. In this work, Drs. Paffenhofer and
              Verity  will quantify simultaneously the feeding, growth and  reproduction
              rates of doliolids, which repeatedly have  constituted a major component of
              neritic zooplankton in  temperate and subtropical waters. The main hypotheses
              are  that:(1) doliolid assemblages above ~ 600 large zooids m -3  are able to
              control phytoplankton, protozooplankton and free-  spawning calanoids, and (2)
              that such high concentrations of  large doliolids are rapidly attained by
              intense reproduction  of two consecutive asexual stages, and high individual
              grown  rates. The significance of these studies is several fold:  first, to
              obtain environmentally-realistic and simultaneous  information on rates of
              consumption and production of the  different doliolid zooids; second, determine
              experimentally  at which concentrations doliolids control phytoplankton, 
              protozooplankton and free-spawning calanoids; third, develop  a model
              describing the direct and indirect effects which a  doliolid assemblage can
              have on these prey populations.  ***
