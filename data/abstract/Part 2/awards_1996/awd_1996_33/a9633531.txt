Abstract    :
              9633531  Lowell    Title: Numerical modeling of two-phase seawater flow in
              oceanic  hydrothermal systems using parallel computers    Hydrothermal
              circulation within the ocean crust controls both heat  and mass transfer
              between the crust and the ocean at mid-ocean  ridges. We can not view this
              process in action because of its  inaccessibility but computer simulations can
              help us understand the  reactions that occur. These reactions are complex
              because they  involve the boiling of seawater under high pressure, which can be
               an unstable process. The PI has developed a computer program that  simulates
              the circulation of fresh water through a hydrothermal  system on land and has
              applied it to Lassen Peak. New measurements  of the temperature and pressure of
              boiling of seawater, and the  formation of salt-free vapor and salt-laden brine
              will be  incorporated into this computer model to determine the effect of 
              circulating seawater in a sub-seafloor hydrothermal system.
