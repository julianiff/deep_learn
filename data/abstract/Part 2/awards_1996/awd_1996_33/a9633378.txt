Abstract    :
              A new type of water and geochemical flux meter will be developed and tested to
              measure the chemical parameters and flow rates of fluids that seep from the
              seafloor into the water column.  These measurements address a key component of
              geochemical and hydro-tectonic studies in both convergent and divergent margins
              on the seafloor. Accurate determination of the magnitudes and spatial
              distribution of flux rates of fluid/geochemical components in the system are
              critical to these geophysical process studies.  Instrumentation will be
              designed to quantify output fluxes (i.e., diffusive and focused) by collecting
              fluid samples and measuring Darcy fluid velocities through the sediment surface
              on the order of 0.1 to 100 mm y-1, allowing direct measurements to be attempted
              for the first time at low flux-rate vents and regions of slow diffuse flow. 
              Funds are also provided to replace several NSF-sponsored instruments that were
              recently lost at sea during an NSF-funded expedition.  Scripps Institution of
              Oceanography is providing $165,000 in cost sharing, which represents 30% of the
              total project's cost.
