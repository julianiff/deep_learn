Abstract    :
              OCE 96-33794  Melville    The project will investigate the initial development
              of  coherent structures in the surface boundary layer, known as  Langmuir
              Circulation (LC), through a series of laboratory  experiments.  Theories
              suggest that LC is generated by the  interaction of surface wave Stokes drift
              with sheared flow  in the boundary layer. However, no detailed examination of 
              the LC instability theory has been made under controlled  conditions.  At issue
              is whether the presently accepted  theory can be proven correct in a laboratory
              setting, and  whether it is relevant to oceanic conditions. Successful 
              completion of this project would resolve the first issue  and frame appropriate
              questions for investigation of the  second.
