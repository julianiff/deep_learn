Abstract    :
              9633719  Chen  Theoretical studies will be made of the stability and  dynamic
              evolution of mesoscopic microstructures during phase  transformations and
              materials processing.  The main  objective is to develop a unified model which
              can  efficiently be employed to study not only the multi-domain  structures
              with competing short- and long-range interactions  in a single crystal, but
              also the multi-grain and multi-  phase microstructures in ceramic materials of
              technological  interest.  A continuum field approach is used and three 
              specific problems will be investigated: domain formation and  dynamics in
              ferroelectric oxides as a result of competing  electrostatic energy, elastic
              energy and domain wall energy;  the formation of nanoscale ordered domains in
              relaxor  ferroelectrics; and, the kinetics of microstructural  evolution in
              multi-grain materials driven by the reduction  in the total interfacial energy.
               %%%  This grant studies an important fundamental problem in  materials
              research which has critical technological  implications.  Namely, analytical
              and numerical methods will  be used to study and understand the evolution of 
              microstructure in materials as they go through changes in  phase.  This is an
              extremely difficult fundamental problem  which directly impacts materials
              processing.  The particular  systems to be studied are ceramic materials in
              which control  of the microstructure has direct bearing on material  proerties.
               Of special interest in this research will be  ferroelectric materials which
              have applications as sensors  and optical components.  ***
