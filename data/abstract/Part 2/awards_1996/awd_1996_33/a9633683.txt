Abstract    :
              The generation of basalts at mid-ocean ridges starts deep in the  mantle and
              progresses as the mantle convects upward.  The  composition of the basalts
              depends on the composition of the  mantle, the minerals present, the
              temperatures and pressures of  melting, and the speed of melting and movement
              the melt through the  mantle.  Trace elements in the basalts can be used to
              explain much  about the melting, but the explanations require that we know the 
              ratio of the trace element in mantle minerals to the amount in the  melted
              mantle.  These ratios (distributions) are determined in  laboratory experiments
              on mantle minerals at high temperature and  pressure.  This project is to
              extend the range of pressures at  which we know the distributions of several
              elements.
