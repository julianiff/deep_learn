Abstract    :
              Abstract - Edgar - 9633104      The World Congress of Chemical Engineering, held
              every five years, brings together the international chemical engineering
              community.  It will be held in the United States during the summer of 1996,
              possibly the only time in the foreseeable future that the Congress will be held
              in the U.S.  There will be 112 technical sessions in area including:  (1)
              energy, safety, environment; (2) future chemical process technologies, products
              and materials; (3) agriculture, food, biotechnology and biomedical; (4)
              technology management and transfer; and (5) advanced fundamentals.     
              Chemical engineers in the United States face global challenges that will
              continue to affect both the industries in which they work and the world in
              which they live.  By focusing on innovations and applications of chemical
              engineering technologies, the World Congress is expected to advance the
              profession's knowledge and the nation's industrial competitiveness.
