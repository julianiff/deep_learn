Abstract    :
              9633154  Tucholke  These investigators from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
              in Massachusetts will study existing oil industry and academic geophysical data
              and well samples to understand the history of the early opening of the North
              Atlantic Ocean.  They will emphasize the conjugate rifted margins of
              Newfoundland and Iberia.  Their specific study will focus on the Newfoundland
              margin, and specifically on the rift basins along the preimeter of the Grand
              Banks.  They will analyze the character and structural variability of basement,
              along-strike segmentation of the rift, the magnitude, timing and spatial
              distribution of extension in each rift segment by means of seismic-sequence
              analysis, and they hope to establish timing of initial seafloor spreading and
              the location of the continent-ocean boundary on this margin.  They will model
              the margin rift history, using their data as constraints, and they will
              integrate these data with similar work ongoing on the Iberia margin which
              includes ocean drilling.  One expected outcome of this work will be the
              identification of appropriate drilling sites on the Newfoundland margin to test
              hypotheses regarding rifting history of the conjugate pair of Newfoundland and
              Iberia.   ***
