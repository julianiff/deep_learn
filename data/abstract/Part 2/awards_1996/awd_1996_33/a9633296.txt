Abstract    :
              9633296  Sharp    In recent years marine chemists have come to realize that
              dissolved  organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) may 
              account for a significant portion of the total organic carbon and  nitrogen
              respectively in the marine environment. Even before this  was known, these
              scientists also realized that identical seawater  samples analyzed by different
              laboratories for DOC and DON often,  if not usually, yield disparate results.  
               In four previous years of NSF-sponsored research, the principal  investigator
              established a seawater standard reference material and  an interlaboratory
              cross-comparison for DOC. In this project, he  will continue the very
              successful DOC seawater standards program at  a reduced level and establish a
              similar standardization and  intercalibration project for DON. This work is
              expected to help  bring substandard analytical practices in some laboratories
              into  line so that global DOC/DON datasets of high quality can be  assembled
              for use in global-scale studies of (for example) marine  carbon and nitrogen
              cycling and ocean chemistry-climate  relationships.
