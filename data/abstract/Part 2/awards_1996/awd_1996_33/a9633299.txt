Abstract    :

              Antonio    CISE Minority Institutions Infrastructure:  Building an Academic
              Pipeline for Minority Scholars    This project builds a pipeline of minority
              students, focusing on the retention of qualified undergraduate and graduate
              students by appropriate financial support and mentoring activities.  The goal
              is to involve students directly in ongoing faculty research projects and thus
              prepare them for graduate studies and research programs.  Graduate minority
              students involved in the program will help faculty in mentoring undergraduates,
              in addition to their own studies and research obligations.    The project
              encompasses two main thrust designed to improve the pipeline of minority
              students prepared for graduate programs.  The first goal is to aggressively
              recruit and develop minority students interested in computer science by
              providing preparatory training, tutoring, and mentoring at the pre-college and
              lower-division undergraduate levels.  The second goal is to provide
              upper-division and graduate students with funding support and increased
              involvement in faculty research in order to improve minority retention and
              graduate enrollment.    Students will be involved in faculty research within
              five important areas:     1) parallel and distributed algorithm design for
              applications in high-performance         scientific computing     2) software
              visualization, and program execution monitoring;     3) parallel compiler
              technology;     4) network routing and scheduling algorithms;     5) parallel
              and distributed simulation techniques.
