Abstract    :
              9633778  Longhi    Title: Collaborative research: experimental determination of
              trace  element distributions between melts and mantle phases at P,T, and  X
              relevant to MORB genesis.    The generation of basalts at mid-ocean ridges
              starts deep in the  mantle and progresses as the mantle convects upward. The 
              composition of the basalts depends on the composition of the  mantle, the
              minerals present, the temperatures and pressures of  melting, and the speed of
              melting and movement the melt through the  mantle. trace elements in the
              basalts can be used to explain much  about the melting, but the explanations
              require that we know the  ratio of the trace element in mantle minerals to the
              amount in the  melted mantle.  These ratios (distributions) are determined in 
              laboratory experiments on mantle minerals at high temperature and  pressure.
              This project is to extend the range of pressures at which  we know the
              distributions of several elements.
