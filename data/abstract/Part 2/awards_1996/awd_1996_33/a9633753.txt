Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT      Swann  EEC-9612765    The proposed research will study the
              reuse and recycling of industrial waste products. This research thrust is
              important for our national economy and supports our ecological  survival. The
              outcomes of this research should generate new and beneficial options for the
              sound management of contaminated soils by communities as well.
