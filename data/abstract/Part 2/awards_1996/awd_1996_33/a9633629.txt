Abstract    :
              This three-year program will construct helmet streamer solutions containing a
              cavity flux rope and a prominence in its closed field region.  The solutions
              will study the initiation and propagation of coronal mass ejections by
              investigating their dynamical evolution due to photospheric shear motion. 
              Using a 2 1/2 dimensional MHD code (incorporating the characteristics in the
              boundary conditions), the PI will construct a quasi-static helmet-streamer
              solution.  This solution will be used to quantitatively study the equilibrium
              structure, force balance and energy content in detail and compare with
              observations.  Using the helmet streamer as an initial state, the PI will also
              study its dynamical evolution due to photospheric shear motions.  The shear is
              anticipated to cause the streamer to erupt impulsively, and the helmet dome,
              cavity and prominence will form typical three-part looplike coronal mass
              ejections.  In all, this work will generate a more physically realistic
              pre-event coronal atmosphere, reveal the physical mechanisms that cause the
              initiation of coronal mass ejections, and address the fundamental question of
              the energy source of coronal mass ejections.
