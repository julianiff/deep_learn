Abstract    :
              Stanley  9633772   This proposal seeks funding for production of a document that
              will offer recommendations for an NSF initiative in the field of paleontology
              under the title Geobiology of Critical Intervals.  The intervals in question,
              representing a broad range of temporal and spatial scales, include times of
              unusual environmental conditions, such as global warmth or widespread oceanic
              anoxia.  They also include important biotic transitions, such as biogeographic
              shifts and episodes of evolutionary turnover.  The initiative should generate
              studies that provide valuable insights relating to possible future changes in
              the ecosystems of our planet.  It should accomplish its goals in part by
              promoting interactions between researchers who would not otherwise collaborate
              with one another-- geobiologists of various types and researchers in such areas
              as geochronology, physical stratigraphy, paleoceanography, paleoclimatology,
              geochemistry.   Funding is sought for a workshop to be held in Washington, D.C.
              in the spring of 1996.  A diverse group of participants will review a variety
              of relevant topics, extract general themes, and assemble an outline for a
              document.  A subset of the participants will then write the document after
              seeking input from the general research community, and experts will review a
              draft before the final documentation is assembled.
