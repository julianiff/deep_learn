Abstract    :
              Previous work indicates that the particulate organic matter (POM)  in sea ice of
              the Weddell Sea is strongly enriched in 13C and 15N  relative to seawater POM. 
              This project will test the hypothesis  that stable isotopic values in Southern
              Ocean sediments are  significantly affected by ice-algal input, which may have
              been  misinterpreted as variations in nutrient utilization and  productivity. 
              The project will examine transects of surface  sediments to determine if a
              north-south gradient exists consistent  with the hypothesis, and will also
              determine stable isotope  variations in several cores spanning the last glacial
              to track  possible changes in ice-algal input.
