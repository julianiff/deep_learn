Abstract    :
              9633667  Menyuk  It is proposed to study high-speed, long-distance NRZ
              communication systems theoretically and computationally.  The focus will be on
              studying the physical effects that limit the attainable data rates and
              distances in parallel with developing reduced models that allow us to study
              these systems more efficiently and over a parameter range than is presently
              possible.  Our work will be characterized by close cooperation with
              experimentalists.  ***
