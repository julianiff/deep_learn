Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division,  
              Professors Sanford Asher, Rob Coalson, and Anthony Duncan will conduct   
              theoretical and experimental studies leading to an understanding of  
              electrostatic interactions in strongly interacting colloidal dispersions.   
              The project will explore the possibility of exploiting these   interactions to
              produce novel colloidal crystalline materials. In part   the work will study
              colloidal crystals composed of mixed positive and   negative colloidal
              particles. The primary techniques to be employed are   photothermal diffraction
              spectroscopy, fluorescence bleaching, molecular   dynamics simulations, and
              other theoretical treatments. The weaknesses in   DLVO
              (Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek) theory, applicable to weakly   interacting
              colloidal systems but substantially flawed when interactions   are strong and
              particle densities high, are expected to be overcome by a   new lattice field
              theory (LFT) approach.   The crystalline colloidal arrays represent an unusual
              arrangement of   matter and are of importance to material science. The work
              deals with   interfacial chemistry of large charged colloidal particles and
              with the   consequent electrostatic potentials and electric fields. 
              Electrostatics   are crucially important in membrane biology. Models developed
              for   colloidal particles at high density, although not necessarily directly  
              applicable, may thus also have biological relevance.
