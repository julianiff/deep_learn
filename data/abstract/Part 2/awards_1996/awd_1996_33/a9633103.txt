Abstract    :
                This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), funded by  the Informations
              Technologies Office, DARPA, addresses the  following problems in the new area
              of Biomolecular/DNA Based  Computation:(a) Determining correct models for 
              biomolecular/DNA computations;(b) Developing techniques that  make
              biomolecular/DNA computations error tolerant;(c)  Determining a set of
              ``practical'' solution techniques for  certain NP-hard problems (such as,
              breaking DES cypher and  ``accurate'' pattern matchings for the human genome
              project)  that exploit the massively parallel biomolecular/DNA  computations. 
              One of the goals of this SGER project is to  initiate and develop collaborative
              efforts with the  Biochemistry Department at Princeton University.***
