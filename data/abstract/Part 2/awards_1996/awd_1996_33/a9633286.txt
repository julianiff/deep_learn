Abstract    :
              Central to the task of understanding a natural language text is determining its
              predicate-argument structure -- the Owho did what to whomO information about
              the text.  Determining this information requires knowledge about the argument
              structure of words in the text.  COMLEX Syntax, developed at NYU for natural
              language processing, provides detailed information about the syntax of verbs,
              but there is no comparably rich resource for nouns.  This project develops a
              design for such a dictionary and creates entries for approximately 1,600
              commonly occurring nouns which take arguments.  The dictionary entries are
              created using a menu-based interface which provides access to a large text
              concordance and allows coders to capture relevant citations during the entry
              process.  This is the first step to providing the natural language research
              community with a broad-coverage resource for text analysis.
