Abstract    :
                The interactions between multi-bodies (particles) will be investigated when
              the interstitial fluid is at a such low pressure that the continuity equation
              does not hold.  Analytical solutions to the gas kinetic equations ware proposed
              to describe the interaction of two spheres by considering the entire range of
              the Knudsen number.     Molecular dynamics methods, including the time
              correlation formalism and generalized Brownian dynamics, are used for more
              complex systems of particles moving in gases.    The work has relevance to
              aerosol science and technology.
