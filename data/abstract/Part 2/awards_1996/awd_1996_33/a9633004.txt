Abstract    :
              ***  9633004  Shaula Yemini               Network event correlation's goal is to
              identify a networked system's problems before they disrupt applications.
              Current approaches to automating event correlation are slow, sensitive to noise
              in their data, and cannot dynamically adapt to a networked system's topology
              changes. The Codebook approach uses coding theory as the base of a novel
              correlation process that is high speed, robust to noise, and dynarnically
              adapts to system changes. The key idea is that since problems are characterized
              by the symptoms they cause, it suffices to monitor the minimal set of symptoms
              that uniquely identify ("encode"") the problems of interest. Real-time
              correlation processing is thus reduced to a fast process of minimal distance
              "decoding" of symptoms. Symptoms can be added to make codes "error-correcting",
              for robustness with respect to noise in the event stream.             
              Potential market areas for this project are:  1.automated problem management
              products for enterprise networks, reducing exposure of mission critical
              applications to network down time. 2. Automated network management solutions
              for network service providers, increasing quality of service while reducing
              operations costs. 3. Selfhealing network, system and application  ***
