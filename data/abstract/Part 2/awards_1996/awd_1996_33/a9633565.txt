Abstract    :
              9633565  Brady  The past several years have seen continuing improvement in 
              materials and techniques for persistent spectral holeburning  (PSHB).  These
              improvements have in several cases yielded  demonstration projects
              tantalizingly close to marketplace viability  but no immediate plans for
              deliverable products are known.  This  workshop will consider how the community
              might overcome this  roadblock and begin to address real and compelling
              applications.   The workshop will include focused presentations on key issues 
              identified by the organizing committee and active working group  sessions on
              specific problems.    PSHB is applicable to both large market applications like
              digital  data storage and optical communications and to smaller market 
              applications like transient data sensors and analog signal  processing.  To be
              applied in practice, PSHB must overcome one of  two barriers:    o To be
              applied where there exist competing technologies, such as  data storage, a PSHB
              system must carry sufficient advantages to  overcome the natural bias against
              changes in fundamental hardware  technology    o To be applied where there
              exists no competing technologies, such  as transient signal capture, the
              advantages of the application must  be sufficient to support its development.  
               In general, the barrier to development for new applications is  lower than the
              barrier to development for established applications  and once a technology,
              such as PSHB, is established for a new small  market application, the barrier
              to transferring it to an  established larger market application is reduced.
