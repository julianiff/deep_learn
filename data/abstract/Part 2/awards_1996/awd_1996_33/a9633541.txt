Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to provide a flexible framework for supporting
              multiple time granularities.  The targeted use of the framework is for
              automatic evaluation of user queries and for discovering temporal patterns
              (i.e., data mining) in an environment where either the user queries or temporal
              patterns involve granularities that do not match the granularity of the stored
              data. The basic idea is to add the necessary functionalities so that the
              database system is able to understand and reason about information involving
              multiple time granularities.  Algorithms for efficiently evaluating user
              queries and discovering temporal patterns will also be investigated, and an
              experimental prototype will be built.  The impact of this research should be
              twofold: Firstly, the proposed framework should provide the basic tools for
              database systems to support flexible user queries, which would free users from
              the unnecessary tasks of writing complex queries or changing their pattern 
              descriptions to fit the specific granularity used to store temporal data in the
              database. Secondly, the optimization techniques explored should provide
              strategies and algorithms for efficient evaluations of queries and discovery of
              temporal patterns. The proposed experimental work should provide insights into
              the subject and into the practicality of the proposed theory as well as
              methods.
