Abstract    :
              9633958  Sheares  The exploitation of the synthesis by the PI of a soluble 
              poly(p-phenylene) derivative is proposed for gas permeable  membrane
              applications.  The first polymer of this class  synthesized in our laboratory,
              poly (2,5-benzophenone), is a  thermally stable polymer as one would expect
              given the rigid  poly(phenylene) backbone.  However, the material is also 
              amorphous, soluble, and film-forming.  These results point  to the potential
              for the synthesis of a variety of  processable, thermally stable polymers using
              a facile, mild  nickel catalyzed reaction.  Additionally, the chemistry will 
              allow the freedom to vary the substituent polarity and chain  packing density
              for the purpose of studying fundamental  structure/property relationships in
              polymeric membranes.  The ability to make systematic modifications in the
              polymer  sidegroups may lead to membranes with improved permeability  and
              selectivity.  The effort is divided into two tasks:  (1)  synthesis and
              characterization of new 2,5-benzophenone and  2,5-diphenylsulfone-based
              polymers and (2) gas permeability  analysis and polymer modification.  %%% 
              This research will provide the basis for new polymer  synthesis aimed at novel
              gas-permeable membranes with  potentially improved permeability and selectivity
              for  environmental applications.  ***
