Abstract    :
              INT 9633040  Ringo        This U.S.-Hungary research project involves Dr. John
              Ringo of Washington State University and Dr. Gabor Temes of Oregon State
              University and their Hungarian counterpart, Dr. Kalman Tarnay of the Technical
              University of Budapest.  Their collaborative efforts will feature improvement
              of design techniques for accurate high-linearity switched-capacitor circuits.  
               Specifically, the researchers will study the underlying problems associated
              with shrinking dimensions of components for CMOS switched capacitor designs. 
              Focus will be on determining: 1) approaches for making novel mixed-mode CMOS
              circuit operation less dependent on the exact characteristics of devices; 2)
              the influence of thermal and quantum-mechanical device effects on these
              circuits; 3) modeling and simulating these effects; and 4) identification of
              ways to minimize their influence.  The intent of this joint research is to
              apply the device-level results obtained at the Technical University of Budapest
              to the optimization of the circuits developed at Oregon State University. 
              Overall, results are expected to yield improved models for computer-aided
              circuit analysis and scaling rules.    This engineering project in solid state
              and microstructures research fulfills the program objective of advancing
              scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Eastern
              Europe to combine complementary talents and  share research resources in areas
              of strong mutual interest and competence.    ??
