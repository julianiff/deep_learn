Abstract    :
              9633094  Federoff  This award provides support for a small workshop to consider
              the implications for NSF of changes underway in how both the public and the
              government view the role of research universities in society, and how, in turn,
              the universities and their faculty view their roles.  Although such change is
              normal and healthy, increasingly the impetus for change comes from lack of
              growth in support for faculty research by Federal agencies joined with
              increased emphasis on teaching and changing patterns of employment among
              graduates.  Recent and rapid development of electronic information storage and
              exchange provide another important impetus.  The workshop will bring together
              faculty, administrators and students to provide information about the effects
              of these and other factors, and on the kinds of change in government and
              university practices that are appropriate responses.   ***
