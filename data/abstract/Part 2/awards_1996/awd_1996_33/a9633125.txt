Abstract    :
              9633125  SANTSCHI    The various naturally-occurring radioactive isotopes of
              thorium  (Th) have come to prominence in chemical oceanography because of 
              their utility in determining the rates of flux of large particulate  and
              colloidal subparticles.  The tendency of Th to preferentially  come out of good
              tracer for particle dynamics (production,  destruction, sinking, mixing). 
              However, the computations involved  are model-based, and the models currently
              used are rather  simplistic. In this research, the PI and his coworkers at
              Texas A&M   University will conduct laboratory experiments to determine the 
              sorption-description kinetic properties of Th in seawater with  particles,
              organic molecules, and colloids aggregate into larger  and larger aggregates, a
              process responsible for the formation of  new particles in marine and other
              natural waters.  The results will  finally be folded into a more realistic
              model of Th behavior that  should help marine chemists and geochemists use the
              Th tracer more  confidently and with a better understanding of its limitations
              as  well as its utility.
