Abstract    :
              9633674 Najafi  The National Science Foundation in the 1980's made the first
              award in the MEMS area to 'seed' the research of this interdisciplinary
              technology.  The Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) Workshop provides
              opportunities for students and faculty to meet and explore the frontiers of
              research in this exciting field.  The size of the Workshop provides and
              intimate forum for researchers to discuss the latest advancements in the field
              and expose the students to a highly imaginative field.  The US currently enjoys
              a lead in the MEMS technology development and there is considerable potential
              for commercialization of MEMS devices and circuits.  For example, the 'airbags'
              and 'seatbelts' in automotive vehicles use MEMS accelerometers and there are
              many applications of piezoresistive pressure sensors.  The request for graduate
              student funding will clearly help expose students to this exciting field and
              benefit in their own research. ***
