Abstract    :
              963330  Sample    The study will attempt to characterize the temporal and
              spatial  evolution of sources of pore fluids in SOP sites 891 and 892 on the 
              Cascadia accretionary prism. Various mass spectrometric techniques  will be
              used to characterize the chemical and isotopic composition  of authigenic
              carbonates on microdrilled samples across large vein  and vug linings. The
              samples will be dated radiometrically through  Th230 method.
