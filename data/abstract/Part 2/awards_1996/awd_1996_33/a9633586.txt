Abstract    :
                  9633586  Berelson    In order to understand the chemistry of the ocean one
              must somehow  measure the rates that substances enter and leave the ocean at
              its  boundaries. In this study the principal investigator will design, 
              construct, and test a "test-series lander" (TSL) - a device that  directly
              measures the flux of dissolved substances across the  sediment-water interface
              by taking a series of overlying water  samples in sequence. The TSL will use
              each of its eight 'spider  arms' to implace an upside-down chamber on the
              sediment surface at  preset times. By sampling the seawater inside the chambers
              over  time (up to five programmable times, spaced over sampling periods  of
              minutes to months) one can collect data to calculate the flux of  solutes of
              interest across the sediment-water interface.  An  important time-and
              money-saving feature of the TSL to be developed  in this study is its ability
              to operate as an unattended 'free  vehicle' that can be programmed, deployed
              from shipboard, and  retrieved weeks or months later.
