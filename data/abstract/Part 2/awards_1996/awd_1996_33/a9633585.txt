Abstract    :
              HRD-9633585  Stevens    The Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR) requests
              funding in the  amount of $25,000 for travel grants for underrepresented
              minorities  to attend its Sixth National Conference to be held at North 
              Carolina Central University (NCCU), June 27,-29, 1996.  This is the  first time
              CUR's biennial conference has been held either at a  public institution or an
              historically Black institution.  This  affords an unprecedented opportunity
              both for the Black academic  community and the growing Hispanic community to
              network within the  undergraduate research community at the national level. 
              The theme  of the June 1996 Conference is:  Enriching Science through 
              Partnerships:  Academics, Industry, Government."  Targeted mailings 
              administered by both CUR's National Office and NC Chancellor Julius  Chambers
              have promoted the conference nationwide to science faculty  at historically
              Black and Hispanic institutions.  Funds are now  being sought to provide travel
              assistance to these targeted  groups.The objective of encouraging
              underrepresented minorities to  attend the conference is three-fold.  The first
              objective is to  provide the opportunity for underrepresented minority faculty
              and  administrators at primarily undergraduate institutions to learn  more
              about funding opportunities and successful undergraduate  research programs
              through networking and attending workshops at the  Conference.  The second
              objective is to bring the voice and  perspective of the underrepresented
              minority community into the  national dialogue on undergraduate research.  And
              the third  objective is to foster the involvement of underrepresented 
              minorities in the organization of the Council on Undergraduate  Research.
