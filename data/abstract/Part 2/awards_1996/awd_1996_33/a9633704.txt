Abstract    :
              This award in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program  supports the
              attendance of several graduate student and post-  doctoral researchers at the
              Eighth International Conference on  Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy.  This
              conference brings  together a multi-disciplinary group of scientists and
              engineers  interested in the use of tuned lasers to selectively and 
              sensitively ionize atoms and molecules for analytical measurement 
              applications.  The focus of the conference in 1996 is on the use  of these
              methods in surface analytical chemistry.  The  participation of graduate
              students and post-doctoral researchers  in this conference is important to the
              future of this important  analytical methodology.   This award enables the
              participation of several young researchers  in the Eighth International
              Conference on Resonance Ionization  Spectroscopy.  Applications of this
              methodology to surface  analytical chemistry is the focus of this year's
              conference.
