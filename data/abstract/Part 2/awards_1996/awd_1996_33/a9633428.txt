Abstract    :
              This research is investigating specification and design  support for software
              evolution by applying hierarchical  abstractions based on intent rather than
              the aggregation and  information-hiding abstractions commonly used in software 
              engineering. Cognitive psychologists have shown that intent  abstraction is
              consistent with human problem-solving  processes. The hypothesis being
              evaluated in this research  is that new types of specifications and designs
              based on  this concept can assist in understanding existing software,  capture
              the most important design rationale information in  an efficient and economical
              way, and support the process of  identifying and analyzing required changes to
              minimize the  introduction of errors during maintenance. To evaluate these 
              hypotheses, protocol analysis techniques are being used to  explore the
              processes involved in software evolution tasks,  and other empirical studies
              are being used to evaluate the  impact of this new form of specification and
              design on these  processes.  ***
