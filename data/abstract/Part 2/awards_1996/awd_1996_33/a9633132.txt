Abstract    :
              Circulation of seawater through the ocean crust has a major effect  on the
              chemistry of the oceans.  The composition of the water that  exits from hot
              springs (hydrothermal vents) can tell us what  processes occur in the ocean
              crust to form the water.  Key features  of the vent water, including the pH,
              the abundance of hydrogen  sulfide, and temperature, can tell what types of
              minerals form in  the ocean crust, and whether biologic activity is occurring
              there.   Presently, however, pH, H2, and H2S can not be measured because we 
              have no  sensors capable of making the measurements at the high  temperatures
              and pressures of the sea floor.  These investigators  have a prototype
              instrument and plan to develop, test, and deploy  it to make these important
              measurements.
