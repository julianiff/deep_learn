Abstract    :
              9633177  Larason, Katherine S  Navajo Community College    CISE Minority
              Institutions Infrastructure:  Computer Information Systems Programs for The
              Navajo Nation    The goal of the project is to update and expand two-year
              computing curricula and courses for Navajo students based on regional
              employment needs, students' educational experience, and recommendations of the
              Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).    Governmental, educational, health
              services, and private employers in the Four Corners region will be surveyed to
              assess current and projected needs for information science employees.  Survey
              results will be presented to high school and college information science
              educators and employers at a Tsaile meeting.  The CS and CIS programs at Navajo
              Community College will be modified and expanded - based on survey findings,
              recommendations from the meeting, and ACM suggested curricula for two-year
              programs in computing - to better prepare Navajo students for further education
              or to find employment in the information industry.    The project is
              significant for several reasons, such as:     - including the first survey of
              information science employment ever done in this area;     - establishing
              communications among high school and college computing educators, and        
              employers that do not currently exist; and     - enhancing students'
              educational and employment prospects
