Abstract    :
              9633811  Oblas    Northeastern University is working with twenty school
              districts in New England to change their curriculum and pedagogy to meet the
              NCTM Standards.  These school districts are joining with the New England
              Regional Center for the Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP), the Center for
              Enhancement in Science and Mathematics Education, the Center for Innovation in
              Urban Education and the Mathematics Department at Northeastern University to
              implement the IMP curriculum in their schools.  Teachers of mathematics at the
              participating schools receive intensive professional development workshops
              during the summer and periodic workshops during the school year.
