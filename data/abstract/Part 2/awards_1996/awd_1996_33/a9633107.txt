Abstract    :
                9633107 Boone  This project address a key issue, p-type doping in II-VI
              semiconductors, utilizing nuclear reactions and homoepitaxy to prepare thin
              film crystalline ZnSe with As dopant atoms 'trapped' at Se lattice sites.  The
              approach is based on growth of ZnSe using isotopically enriched 74Se exposed to
              thermal neutrons before growth to allow the doping process to be decoupled from
              crystal growth, and other processes which can lead to compensation effects. The
              idea is that most of the resulting 75Se will decay to As after growth is
              completed, and ZnSe will have been synthesized by a process 'guaranteeing'
              substitutional As doping. The aim of the research is to provide unique material
              to gain fundamental insight into fundamental doping mechanisms in II-VI
              materials. %%% The project is multidisciplinary combining fundamental materials
              physics and materials processing studies with advanced characterization tools
              and analysis methods to address basic issues in a topical area of high
              scientific value and potential technological benefits.  The research will
              contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level important
              to several aspects of advanced electronic/photonic device fabrication and
              operation.  The knowledge and understanding gained from this research project
              is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of
              advanced devices by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for
              designing and producing improved materials.  An important feature of the
              program is the integration of research and education through the training of
              students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***
