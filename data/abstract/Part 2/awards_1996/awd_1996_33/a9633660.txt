Abstract    :
              9633660    Mellor    This is a collaborative project to develop a regional,
              prognostic, three-dimensional numerical model of the Indonesian Seas
              Archipelago to investigate circulation and mixing, particularly related to the
              exchange between the Pacific and Indian Ocean.  The overall goal is a model
              capable of describing both the steady state and time variations of the
              circulation for a given external forcing.  Specific objectives include
              investigation of the effects of inter-ocean pressure differences and local
              forcing on transport and thermohaline characteristics, the role of bottom
              topography in partitioning the throughflow, and the influence of tidal
              oscillations on turbulent mixing.  The Blumberg-Mellor model will provide the
              basis for the modeling effort.  The team at Princeton will provide the model,
              along with the expertise to apply it to the specific region.  The team at
              Columbia University will provide the expertise for analysis of the available
              data and model output.    ??
