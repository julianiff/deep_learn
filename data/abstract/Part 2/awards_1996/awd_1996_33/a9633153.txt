Abstract    :
                9633153  Jackman     Each year increasing numbers of young fathers spend time
              in prison.  This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement study will examine the
              meaning and practice of fatherhood for these young men and explore how
              incarceration and parole affect their understanding of fatherhood and their
              ability to fulfill fatherhood responsibilities.  Particular focus will be
              placed on the areas of paternity establishment, child support, visitation, and
              in-kind support.  The study is also intended to explore variations in fathering
              patterns for different groups of young parolees.  It is expected that a number
              of factors, including race and education, are important in explaining
              differences in fathering attitudes and behaviors among parolees. The research
              questions will be approached by examining attitudes and experiences of white,
              black and Latino parolee fathers in the California Youth Authority System.  To
              collect data from the young men a multi-stage design will be employed. The
              stages will include observations in parenting classes, a probability survey,
              and in-depth interviews.  The data generated by this multi-method design will
              be conducive to both quantitative and qualitative analytic techniques.  The
              information obtained from this study will provide a broad understanding of
              fathering in a young parolee population.  ****  ??
