Abstract    :
              9633470    Gordon    This  is a collaborative project to develop a regional,
              prognostic,  three-dimensional   numerical  model   of   the   Indonesian  
              Seas  Archipelago  to  investigate circulation and  mixing,  particularly 
              related to the exchange between the Pacific and Indian Ocean.   The  overall
              goal is a model capable of describing both the steady state  and  time 
              variations  of  the circulation  for  a  given  external  forcing.  Specific
              objectives include investigation of the  effects  of  inter-ocean pressure
              differences and local forcing on transport  and thermohaline characteristics,
              the role of bottom topography  in  partitioning   the   throughflow,  and  the 
              influence   of   tidal  oscillations on turbulent mixing.  The Blumberg-Mellor 
              model  will  provide  the basis for the modeling effort.  The team at 
              Princeton  will provide the model, along with the expertise to apply it to the 
              specific region.  The team at Columbia University will provide  the  expertise
              for analysis of the available data and model output.
