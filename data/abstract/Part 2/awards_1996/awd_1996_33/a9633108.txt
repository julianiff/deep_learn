Abstract    :
              DMI-9633108  Mazumder   This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will
              investigate the surface finish, dimensional accuracy and residual stress in
              components made of H13 tool steel by a process called Laser Aided Direct Metal
              Deposition (LADMD).  The innovation in this new approach to rapid prototyping
              technology is fabrication by direct metal deposition of tool steel.  This makes
              it possible to produce tooling, for example, dies and molds, by deposition
              rather than removal methods.  Key questions for those using this technology for
              tooling are the dimensional accuracy and residual stress state of tooling,
              because of their affect on the life of the tooling and fit of components
              produced by it.  Another issue in die and mold manufacture is surface finish, a
              place where most of the layered manufacturing technologies are weak, but
              surface finish is important to the appearance of components and flow of
              material in a die or mold cavity.  This project will provide experimental data
              on dimensional accuracy, surface finish, and residual stress, by producing and
              measuring a standard rapid prototyping test part using LADMD.  Materials
              evaluation will be done in cooperation with Doehler Jervis and DCD Technology,
              firms that make and use dies.   The impact of this new approach will be
              reductions in lead-time for the manufacture of production parts that need
              special tooling, leading to more competitive and customized products to satisfy
              customer needs.
