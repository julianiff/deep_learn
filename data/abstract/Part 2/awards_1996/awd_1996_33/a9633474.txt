Abstract    :
              OCE 96-33474  Peterson    The project will continue investigation into southern
              ocean  anomalies in sea surface temperature, sea level pressure,  surface
              winds, and ice extent which appear to be related to  El Nina - Southern
              Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena.  In  preliminary work these anomalies have been
              interpreted as  an Antarctic circumpolar wave propagating eastward, and 
              generation by ENSO activity in the western tropical Pacific  has been proposed.
               In this project, a variety of  historical data sets will be obtained, merged,
              and analyzed  to allow examination of southern ocean anomalies over a two 
              decade interval. The spatial and temporal characteristics  of the anomalies
              will be described.  Emerging hypotheses  about the link between the circumpolar
              waves and ENSO  forcing will be investigated.
