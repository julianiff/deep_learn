Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to study, design and evaluate control mechanisms
              for  time-multiplexing optical interconnection networks in multiprocessor 
              applications.  Such mechanisms decouple the relatively slow network control
              from  the high optical data transmission bandwidth. The research will assess
              the  advantages, capabilities and limitations of time-division multiplexing. 
              Specifically, models will be developed to specify the communication
              requirements  of applications, to express and measure the communication
              locality present in  communication loads, and to estimate the communication
              cost in multiplexed  interconnection networks.  Different control protocols
              will be simulated and  tested on traces collected from actual parallel
              applications, and on synthetic  traces generated with the help of the
              communication locality model. Centralized,  distributed and pipelined control
              strategies will be implemented and compared.    This project is motivated by
              several observations. First, without multiplexing,  the control overhead of
              establishing end-to-end connections in a network may be  prohibitive. Second,
              applications exhibit communication locality which amplifies  the benefits of
              multiplexing. Third, the high bandwidth of optical paths allows  for
              multiplexing with minimal effect on the transmission rate on individual 
              connections.  Finally, the nature of massively parallel programs allows
              compilers  to determine, with current technology, the multiplexing sequences
              that satisfy  most of the communication requirements.
