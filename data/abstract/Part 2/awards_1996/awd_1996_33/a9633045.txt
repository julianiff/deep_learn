Abstract    :
              9633045  Jackson    There exist a multitude of theories which seek to answer the
              question:  Why do people commit crime?  The most prominent theories can be
              categorized under three headings: control theory, socialization/learning
              theory, and stress (anomie) theory.  This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement
              research seeks to conduct a secondary analysis of data to test Gottfredson and
              Hirschi's 1990 theory of criminal behavior.  In particular this research will
              test Gottfredson and Hirschi's assertions that (1) self-control, combined with
              opportunity, is the main independent cause of crime and delinquency, and (2)
              the major competing theories of crime--control, socialization/learning, and
              stress--have erroneously concluded that certain social variables (i.e., social
              bonds to family and school, association with delinquent peer groups,
              unemployment or social class, and dropping out of high school) are the
              independent causes of crime and delinquency when in fact they are actually the
              result of low self-control, and thus, are only correlated with crime.  This
              research will conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of the Youth and
              Transition data set to test each of the three major theories of crime,
              introducing self-control as an independent variable.  If Gottfredson and
              Hirschi's prediction is correct, then the explanatory power of competing
              theoretical models should be reduced or eliminated entirely.  These results
              would suggest that self-control combined with opportunity is a significant
              predictor of crime and various other correlates of crime.  ***  ??
