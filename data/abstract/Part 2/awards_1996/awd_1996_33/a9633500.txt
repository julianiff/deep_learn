Abstract    :
              9633500  Herrero-Bervera    This grant provides $60,000 as one-half support of
              the costs of  acquiring a 2-G superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) equipped 
              with DC SQUIDS for the paleomagnetics laboratory at the  University of Hawaii. 
              The acquisition of a state-of-the-art SRM  at the University of Hawaii will
              provide for high sensitivity  measurements of the relative paleointensity
              recorded in weakly  magnetized marine sediments for research on the behavior of
              the  Earth's geomagnetic field.  Furthermore, its reduced operating  costs
              relative to continued operation of their antiquated ScT  SRM, due to the high
              boil off rate of liquid nitrogen and helium  associated with its operation,
              will be economically beneficial in  the long run for the health of the
              paleomagnetic research program  at Hawaii.  This acquisition provides a
              valuable institutional  and regional resource for paleomagnetic studies which
              will  include studies of geomagnetic field behavior, marine and  lacustrine
              magnetostratigraphy and polarity transitions observed  in igneous rocks.  ***
