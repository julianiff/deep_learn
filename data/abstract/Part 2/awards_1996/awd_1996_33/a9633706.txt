Abstract    :
                     Conrey 9633706   This award provides partial funding for the conference
              "In Celebration of the Centenary of the Prime Number Theorem: A Symposium on
              the Riemann Hypothesis." One hundred years ago, Hadamard and de la Vallee
              Poussin independently gave the final arguments in the proof of the Prime Number
              Theorem. They followed a plan that had been mapped out by Riemann some 37 years
              earlier. However, Riemann's goals for understanding the prime numbers are still
              not realized as the famous Riemann Hypothesis remains  tantalizingly unsolved.
              Speakers at this conference will present many of  the interesting developments
              that have arisen from Riemann's original  work, with an eye to understanding
              future research directions regarding the zeros of the Riemann zeta-function and
              related L-functions.  This research falls into the general mathematical field
              of Number Theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the
              whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing with the
              divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches
              of mathematics and  was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic
              reasons. However, within  the last half century it has become an indispensable
              tool in diverse  applications in areas such as data transmission and
              processing, and  communication systems.
