Abstract    :
              9633529  Langseth  This collaborative project between researchers at
              Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University in the City of New York
              and the University of Illinois at Chicago will prepare and produce a synthesis
              on CD-ROM of geothermal data collected over ten years of the Ocean Drilling
              Program.  The investigators will evaluate the quality of all measurements of
              downhole temperature and thermal conductivity of the sediments and rock.  They
              will prepare a report on the quality of the data, a discussion to place them in
              global context, and a bibliography.  The completed CD-ROM will be provided to
              the Ocean Drilling Program and the National Geophysical Data Center for
              distribution to interested researchers, as well as to the International Heat
              Flow Commission for inclusion in their worldwide database.  ***
