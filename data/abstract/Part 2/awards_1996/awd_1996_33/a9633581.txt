Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of new chiral catalysts.   
              Neutral bis(oxazoline) bidentate and pyridine-bis(oxazoline) tridentate  
              ligands will be employed in conjunction with cationic copper(II),   zinc(II),
              and aluminum(III) salts for the generation of new families of   chiral Lewis
              acids. These chiral complexes will be investigated in the   enantioselective
              catalysis of bimolecular and intramolecular Diels-Alder   reactions, Mukaiyama
              aldol reactions, cunjugate addition reactions of   unsaturated imides and
              alkylidene malonates and the reduction of   beta-ketoesters.  Enantioselective
              olefin cyclopropanation, and   aziridination will also be explored as will
              approaches to the synthesis   of new chiral multi-dentate ligands bearing
              stereogenic P-chiral   phosphorus and S-chiral sulfur ligands where chirality
              at the metal-bound   heteroatom is either defined or induced from proximal
              stereogenic carbon   centers.  During the course of the above studies, relevant
                target-oriented natural products syntheses will be used to illustrate the  
              generality of the reactions being developed.  With this renewal award,   the
              Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of  Dr. David A.   Evans
              of the Department of Chemistry at Harvard University.   Professor   Evans will
              focus his work on projects that center on the development of   new
              stereoselective organic reactions with an emphasis on absolute   stereocontrol
              through asymmetric catalysis.   Development of this type of   methodology has
              an important impact on the fields of medicine, biology   and materials science.
