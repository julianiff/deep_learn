Abstract    :
              HRD-9633078  McIntyre    The 1997 NCBPS meeting is scheduled to b held February
              of 1997 with  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as the tentative host 
              institution.    The 1996 Conference will be the tenth consecutive meeting of
              NCBPS.   The objective of the NCBPS meeting is to assist and encourage Black 
              students who have shown interest and ability in physics to enter  and complete
              Ph.D. programs, and to initiate research, teaching, or  technical careers
              commensurate with their educational achievement  in physics.    NCBPS
              originated with a group of Black graduate students at the  Massachusetts
              Institute of Technology.  The conferences have  organized and implemented by
              students with faculty and staff  assistance at the various host institutions
              throughout the country.    Information is presented through the following
              mechanisms (1)  lectures by distinguished scientists and engineers, (2)
              technical  presentations by Black graduate and undergraduate students, (3) 
              workshops on the graduate admission process, (4) seminars on  financial support
              to students for science education at the  university level, (5) forums on
              successfully completing a graduate  programs in physics, and (6) career
              opportunities at all degree  levels.  The primary audience for the Conference
              consists of  undergraduate students who are majoring in physics and/or who have
               expressed a sincere interest in physics.  A principal goal of the  Conference
              is to permit these students, ho are in the process of  making career decisions,
              the opportunity to discuss with graduate  students and scientists their
              concerns regarding a scientific  career and to seek recommendations and advice
              about educational  paths.
