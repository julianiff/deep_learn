Abstract    :
              9633477  Erikson      This  Dissertation Improvement project examines  the
              emergence, growth and activities of  a gay/lesbian  community church in San
              Francisco and its relationship to the larger San Francisco gay/lesbian movement
              and community.  This case study will advance sociological analysis and
              understanding of the interconnections among social movements, religion, and
              collective identity.  The research employs a variety of qualitative methods,
              including semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and
              archival/document analysis.  It seeks to fill an empirical gap in the
              sociological literature on gay and lesbian religious communities and will test
              the general hypothesis that gay and lesbian religious participation and
              organizations, in interaction with the larger gay and lesbian community,
              facilitate the creation of new personal and collective identities, and thereby
              increase participants' sense of personal and collective efficacy and
              empowerment.
