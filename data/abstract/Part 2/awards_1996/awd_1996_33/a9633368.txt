Abstract    :
              The focus of this work is fourfold. First, methodology will be developed  
              whereby biocatalytically synthesized inositol hydroaromatics are   abiotically
              converted into pyrogallol, phloroglucinol,   hydroxyhydroquinone, hydroquinone,
              catechol and resorcinol.  Second, the   uptake of D-glucose in E. coli will be
              altered to increase the percent   yield of D-glucose into 3-dehydroshikimic
              acid, a key intermediate in the   biocatalytic synthesis of adipic acid,
              catechol and gallic acid.  Third,   a biocatalytic route to hydroquinone will
              be created by expressing the P.   chrysosporium gene encoding vanillate
              hydroxylase in   p-hydroxybenzoate-synthesizing E. coli.  Fourth,  a
              biocatalytic   synthesis of resorsinol will be developed using genes encoding  
              gallate-synthesizing and gallate-degrading enzymes from P. blakesleeanus,   K.
              pneumoniae, P. acidigallici and E. oxidoreducens.  With this   Environmentally
              Benign Chemical Synthesis and Processing award, the   Synthetic Organic Program
              is supporting the research of Dr. John W. Frost   of the Department of
              Chemistry at Michigan State University.  Dr. Frost   will focus his work on
              developing synthetic methodology that allows a   variety of chemicals to be
              economically derived from carbohydrate   feedstocks.  In this way, nontoxic
              D-glucose, D-xylose and L-arabinose,   derived from renewable corn starch and
              fiber,  can replace carcinogenic   benzene, derived from nonrenewable fossil
              fuels, as a synthetic starting   material.
