Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9633752    This is an extension of studies on reduction of
              nitrogen oxides by methane.  It has been established that certain rare-earth
              oxides, with or without promotion by strontium, have high specific activities
              for this reaction and activity is enhanced by excess oxygen.  In this work, 
              lanthana and neodymia (excellent catalysts in the bulk form) both with and
              without strontium promoter, are dispersed on high-surface-area supports such as
              alumina, silica, or zirconia.  Catalytic behavior and rate expressions over a
              range of oxygen partial pressures are determined  using a variety of reductants
              including methane, methanol, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide.  The supported
              rare-earth-oxide catalysts are characterization by BET measurements,
              chemisorption of nitric oxide and other gases, X-ray diffraction, diffuse
              reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS), electron-spin
              resonance, thermal analysis, and isotopic kinetic studies.    This work is
              directly relevant to the current efforts to control emissions of nitrogen
              oxides and reduce occurrence of   acid rain.  This technology is suitable for
              emission control in both stationary boiler (power plant) sources and lean-burn 
              mobile (automotive) sources.
