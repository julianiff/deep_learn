Abstract    :
              9633105  Fisher         The overall goal of this study is to quantify the 
              productivity and biomass of the tubeworms, associated free-  living bacteria,
              and associated fauna, and to identify and  quantify trophic pathways within and
              out of the tubeworm  communities in a singel hydrothermal vent system.  The 
              experimental design will allow modeling of these parameters  with temporal
              variability of venting, and the data will be  suitable for inclusion in larger
              scale modeling efforts of  vent field scale productivity.       The study site
              is a portion of the Endeavour segment of  the Juan de Fuca Ridge, where many
              other programs are  underway and planned in conjunction with the seafloor 
              observatory component of the US RIDGE program. Valuable  input from other
              studies and the results from this project  can be interpreted in the larger
              context of understanding  the variability of the geochemistry, biology and
              geology of  ridge systems.  ***
