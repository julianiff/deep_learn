Abstract    :
              Rizzoli    OCE-9633145    The general circulation, biogeochemical cycling and
              plankton  dynamics of the  lower trophic level of the Black Sea will be
              investigated  using a hierarchy of  increasing complex interdisciplinary
              numerical models. First  a one-dimensional  coupled physical-biological model
              will be used to improve  our understanding of  the biogenic element cycling,
              pelagic ecosystem carbon and  energy flow and  microbial processes within the
              deep interior and shelf  regions of the Black Sea.  Then three-dimensional
              studies will look at (a) the pathways  of nutrient transport  and plankton
              productivity on the regional scale; (b) the  patchiness of chlorophyll 
              concentrations in relation to mesoscale features of the  general circulation;
              and  (c) the exchange of nutrients and biogenic materials between  the shelf
              and  interior. The model results will be compared with in-situ  observations
              collected  by several international programs.
