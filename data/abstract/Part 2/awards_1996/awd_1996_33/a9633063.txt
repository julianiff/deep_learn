Abstract    :
              Whitehead  9633063  A laboratory and theoretical study of buoyancy-driven flows 
              involving pairs of  driving forces, either from temperature and salinity, or 
              from temperature and  surface stress, will be conducted to see if multiple
              states  predicted in simple  models also exist in more complex system. To that
              end  additional physical  processes known to be important in the ocean, such as
               vertical transport,  rotation and surface stress will be included in later 
              experiments. The results will  more clearly quantify the interdependence of
              salt forcing  and heat flow in the  ocean and the role of double diffusion and
              wind stress.
