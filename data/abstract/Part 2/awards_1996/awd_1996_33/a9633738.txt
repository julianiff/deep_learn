Abstract    :
              9633738  Smith    What explains the explosive growth of home schooling and
              Christian schooling among conservative Protestants in America?  This Doctoral
              Dissertation Improvement research proposes to investigate the relationship
              between religious identities and educational choices with data that are
              representative of religious conservatives throughout the nation.  It will
              explore how the symbolic boundaries of family, faith and schools are
              constructed by conservative Protestants, and how these cultural constructions
              interact with changing social conditions, including the social mobility of
              conservative Protestants and the increasing differentiation of the educational
              field, to determine schooling decisions.  NSF support will fund the creation of
              a nationally-representative dataset of conservative Protestant schoolers, which
              will include information from 71 personal and 240 telephone interviews.  This
              dataset will provide data to address questions such as: (1) which conservative
              Protestants from what social positions are attracted to alternative education?,
              (2) what are the motives behind the decision to leave the public schools?, (3)
              what role does religious identities and traditions play in parents' rationales
              for leaving the public school?, and (4) what impact does broader social and
              cultural forces (e.g., "cultural war" and privatization of religion) have on
              the involvement of conservative Protestants in alternative education.  ****  ??
