Abstract    :
              The PIs will install a 24-station magnetometer array at low latitudes across
              China to study:  (1) magnetic pulsations and their causative substorms, (2)
              magnetospheric control of the equatorial electrojet, (3) low latitude magnetic
              pulsations, and (4) traveling current vortices at low latitude.  Chinese
              scientists, collaborating with this project, will operate the array.  Since the
              instrument has been developed by UCLA and NASA, the NSF funding will cover the
              cost of fabrication and analysis in the US.  The apparatus will study the
              region below L=2, where no large two dimensional array is currently deployed.
