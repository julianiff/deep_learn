Abstract    :
              9633300  Spilhaus  This award will help four graduate students attend an AGU
              Chapman Conference to be held next November in the Canary Islands.  A number of
              recent studies have shown that crustal modification of ocean island basalts may
              be quite common.  the question that then arises is whether crustal
              contamination is simply noise affecting otherwise robust mantle signatures, or
              whether the characteristics currently attributed to mantle reservoirs reflect
              some combination of crustal and mantle input.  The Conference will address this
              question from a number of perspectives.  Four broad discussion subjects have
              been proposed, which will hopefully correspond to four days of focus at the
              meeting.  They are:  1.  The state of the science in chemical geodynamics, as
              determined from studies of oceanic magmas.  2.  The pressure-temperature-time
              constraints on ocean island magmatism.  3.  The physical process of magma-crust
              interaction.  4.  The geochemistry of magma-crust interaction.
