Abstract    :
              The naturally-occurring radionuclids Th234, Pb210, and Po210 have  in the past
              proven to be useful as tracers of particles dynamics in  the marine water
              column, especially so for the estimation of the  vertical flux of particulate
              organic matter.  In this project,  investigators at the estimation of the
              vertical flux of particulate  organic matter.  In this project, investigators
              at the University  of Washington will study how these radiotracers interact
              with  colloidal organic matter (i.e., organic material traditionally, if 
              somewhat artificially, defined as being smaller than particulate  but larger
              than dissolved material) in the coastal waters of Santa  Barbara Basin.  After
              isolating and chemically characterizing the  colloidal organic matter, the
              investigators will determine how  these two isotopes are partitioned been
              particulate, colloidal, and  dissolved phases.  The results are expected to
              lead to a better  kinetic understanding of the role colloidal material plays in
              the  generation of particulates and in the marine geochemistry of tracer 
              isotopes.
