Abstract    :
              An adaptive computing system is one that evolves its behavior  based on changes
              in the environment. For an adaptable system  built on a distributed
              architecture where multiple machines are  connected by a nework, such changes
              can range from site failures  to updated application requirements. The
              evolutionary action  taken when a change occurs can vary as well, ranging from 
              dynamically reconfiguring the system software to maintain the  same service
              guarantees under changed conditions, to negotiating  new service guarantees
              with the application.    The goal of this project is to develop fundamental new
              techniques  for designing and implementing adaptive distributed computing 
              systems.  The specific focus is on providing a distribution  support layer, a
              software layer implementing strong execution  guarantees regarding the
              distributed state of the application,  that can adapt to changes. The research
              concentrates on two lines  of investigation: (1) the development of a
              conceptual model for  systems of this type and (2) a new approach to
              implementing  adaptive distributed systems based on fine-grain code modules 
              called micro-protocols. The framework is being extended to  support dynamic
              evolution of software, including reconfiguration,  dynamic code linking, and
              runtime code generation.  ***
