Abstract    :
                This award provides funds to the Scientific Committee on Oceanic  Research
              (SCOR) in order to assist qualified ocean scientists from  developing countries
              attend various planning workshops and  international scientific meetings that
              are sanctioned by SCOR and  of interest to the National Science Foundation. 
              This ongoing  project has become the corner stone of SCOR's efforts to provide 
              assistance to marine scientists in the third world and, more  recently in
              Russia and Eastern Europe.  All recipients of funds are  informed that this
              assistance is made possible through a grant to  SCOR from the US National
              Science Foundation.  The NSF funds are  used to broaden international
              involvement in these activities in  the preliminary phases; once the value of
              an individual's  participation is demonstrated, he or she will be invited to
              join  the relevant group and will then be supported from the basic SCOR 
              budget.  Project objectives include: broadening traditional  participation in
              ocean-related international scientific meetings to  include more scientists
              from developing countries; enhancing the  exchange of detailed regional
              knowledge or expertise in planning  for large-scale oceanographic experiments;
              and providing greater  opportunities leading to the involvement of developing
              countries in  international collaborative programs, such as JGOFS and GLOBEC.
