Abstract    :
              OCE 96-33423   Jessup      The project will determine the role of microscale
              wave    breaking as a forcing mechanism in air-sea gas transfer.    The
              breaking of very short surface gravity waves without    air entrainment, known
              as microscale breaking, disrupts the    diffusive sublayer which governs the
              flux of gas across the    air-sea interface.  Thus, microscale breaking has
              been    proposed as a dominant mechanism for gas transfer.  This    proposal
              will establish a new approach for the prediction    of air-sea gas transfer
              velocity based on quantitative    measures of microscale breaking derived from
              infrared (IR)    imaging techniques in the laboratory.
