Abstract    :
              9633479  Bennett  This award supports graduate student participation in the "
              Hysteresis Modeling and   Micromagnetism" to be held on May 20-22, 1996 at the
              Ashburn, Virginia campus of     George Washington University.  Hysteresis is a
              widespread phenomenon, studied most   intensively in magnetism, but also found
              in ferroelectricity, mechanical behavior   including shape memory effects,
              adsorption, and many other fields.  This workshop will   focus its main
              attention on magnetic hysteresis, but some seminal work in nonmagnetic  
              hysteresis will be brought into the discussion by leading practitioners in
              these areas.    Micromagnetism is a theoretical formulation which permits the
              prediction of domains and   domain walls, and their movement in changing
              magnetic fields.  Micromagnetism is   currently in a very high state of
              world-wide activities.  This workshop is unique in that it   addresses not only
              the statistical modeling (i.e. hysteresis), but the relationship between   
              hysteresis and micromagnetism.  ***
