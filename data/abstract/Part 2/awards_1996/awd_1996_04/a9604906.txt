Abstract    :
                 The goal of this project is to equip the National Magnetic Resonance 
              Facility at Madison (NMRFAM)  1  with a Customized Desk-top Experiment 
              Management System (CDEMS) that will provide users with adaptable  desk-top
              access to the software and hardware resources of the facility.  This project is
              a joint effort between members of NMRFAM (in the  Biochemistry Department) and
              the ZOO team (in the Computer Sciences  Department, University of
              Wisconsin-Madison); the latter group has  developed the tools to be used in
              constructing the CDEMS. NMRFAM is a  shared instrumentation laboratory
              dedicated to NMR investigations of  structure- function relationships in
              biomolecules. Hardware at NMRFAM  includes five high-resolution NMR
              spectrometers (with proton resonance  frequencies between 400 and 750 MHz), a
              Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI)  Power Onyx computer system, and a number of SGI
              workstations, the  associated software encompasses a wide variety of commercial
              and  academic software packages used for processing and analyzing NMR data  and
              for retrieving and examining other information available on the  systems
              studied. The proposed desk-top access capabilities will enable  NMRFAM to
              project these assets beyond its walls and to make them freely  available to
              collaborators and other consumers of its technology. The  CDEMS will facilitate
              collaborations of scientists over the Internet  and will enable users to
              interact with NMRFAM staff members in planning  and scheduling experiments and
              in processing and analyzing data. Users,  regardless of their physical
              location, will be able to execute, from  their own desk-tops, not only
              simulations and data analyses, but actual  data collection runs. In addition,
              the CDEMS will be designed to  maximize able the efficiency of available
              computational resources.       .
