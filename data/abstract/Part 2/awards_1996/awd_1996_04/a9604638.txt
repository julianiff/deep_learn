Abstract    :
                  9604638  Fryxell  Complex organisms evolved from simpler ancestors through a
              process that included gene duplication and divergence.  After duplication, the
              additional genes may have been relatively free to vary and take on new
              functions.  This genetic flexibility has helped many organisms adapt to new
              environments.  The DNA sequences in humans and other organisms provide a rich
              record from which a detailed evolutionary history of gene duplication and
              divergence may be deduced.  This record will be mathematically analyzed in
              multicellular animals.  The primary goal of this project is to help illuminate
              the history and genetic mechanisms of evolution, as well as the fundamental
              question of how complex organisms arose from simpler ancestors.  Evolutionary
              relationships among genes, such as the descent of several modern genes from a
              single ancestral gene, provide a powerful basis for predicting molecular
              function and three-dimensional conformation.  Thus, the basic knowledge gained
              from these evolutionary studies will be used in many other fields, including
              biochemistry, pharmacology, biomedical sciences, and biotechnology.
