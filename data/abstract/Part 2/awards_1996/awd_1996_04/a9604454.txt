Abstract    :
                    Cameron    9604454        In this project, Dr. Cameron examines the
              development of indirect developing sea urchin larvae, a life stage that arises
              from the embryo after the onset of feeding and bears little morphological
              resemblance to the adult into which it will eventually metamorphose. He focuses
              particularly though not exclusively on those larval developmental processes
              that lead to the formation of adult primordial structures.  He will employ
              modern techniques of confocal microscopy, blastomere injection, lineage
              tracing, in situ hybridization and genetic chimeras to illustrate the
              developmental mechanism that lead to the formation of larval structures. The
              studies that he proposes fall into the following categories:  1) The mapping of
              set aside cell populations through the use of vital dyes, DNA stains and
              bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. 2) Experiments to alter larval division
              patterns and to test the cell number regulation in structures stemming from set
              aside cells.  3) The contribution of isolated animal-half embryos, vegetal-half
              embryos and the skeletogenic cells to adult structures and the larval primordia
              from which they arise using genetic chimeras detected by genomic microsatellite
              markers.  4) The examination of expression in larvae of genes likely to be
              involved in the formation of adult structures. 5) Observations on the adult
              rudiment to determine the earliest incidence of pentameral symmetry and the
              manner in which it is established.
