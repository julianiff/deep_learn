Abstract    :
              9604915  Wu    This award supports cooperation between Yue Wu and Daxing  Han,
              University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and Kong  Guanglin, Institute of
              Semiconductors, Chinese Academy od  Sciences, Beijing, on the role of hydrogen
              in the  metastability of hydrogenated amorphous silicon.  The  research problem
              is an important one that has not been  satisfactorily addressed despite much
              research over the  years.  The investigators propose a joint study of infrared 
              absorption and nuclear magnetic resonance to explore the  metastable
              photostructural effects associated with extended  illumination. The Chinese
              group has recently published  results that are somewhat controversial;
              cooperation in  further research in this area will allow the US team to 
              advance current understanding by attempting to replicate  results on other
              samples of amorphous silicon produced by  other growth techniques.    Advances
              in this research could contribute to improved  technology in both photovoltaics
              and flat-panel displays.  This project is jointly supported by NSF and the
              Chinese  Academy of Sciences and the National Natural Science  Foundation of
              China.
