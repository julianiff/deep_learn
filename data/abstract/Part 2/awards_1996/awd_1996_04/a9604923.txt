Abstract    :
              9604923  Cheng  Genomic instability causes genetic changes including chromosome
              loss, translocation, recombination and point mutations and plays an important
              role in genetic diversity and evolution. The long-term goal of the proposed
              work is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that control genomic stability in
              vertebrates. A unique screen, developed in this laboratory, creates an
              opportunity to render heterozygous mutations homozygous in one step using
              parthenogenesis in the zebrafish. A screen for genetic instability mutants
              (gin) is based upon the detection of abnormally high rates of somatic loss of
              heterozygosity (LOH). The screen allows frequencies of LOH as low as 10-5 to be
              detected.  Mutagenesis of male zebrafish with ethylnitrosourea has resulted in
              1-2 mutations per average gene per 1000 haploid genomes. One gin mutant has
              been identified and will be characterized, as will other such mutants as they
              are isolated, by Mendelian inheritance, complementation testing, quantitation
              of the effect of mutations and genetic mapping.    Genomic instability mutants
              in unicellular organisms gave the first significant insights into the
              mechanisms of mutation. However, until now, such studies have not been possible
              in vertebrates. It is now possible to identify new genes that may be specific
              to vertebrates. The information to be gained from this study may enhance our
              understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved in genetic mechanisms
              operative in vertebrates and also contribute to an understanding of some
              genetic diseases.
