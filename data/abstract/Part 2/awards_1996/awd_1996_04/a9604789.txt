Abstract    :
                   It is proposed that a Rigaku R-Axis IV imaging plate  system for collection
              of protein crystallographic and fiber  diffraction data, a Silicon Graphics
              Indy XGE computer to  drive the imaging plate system, and a Silicon Graphics 
              Indigo2/R10000 workstation with Solid IMPACT graphics for  computations using
              the collected data be purchased for use in  structural studies of viruses,
              proteins, and nucleic acids by  Drs. Stubbs, Newcomer, Kim, and others.  The
              new equipment  will replace an antiquated data collection system mounted on  an
              x-ray generator that is almost 30 years old, and will  upgrade an existing area
              detector that is not capable of  handling many of the crystallographic problems
              or anv of the  fiber diffraction problems under study
