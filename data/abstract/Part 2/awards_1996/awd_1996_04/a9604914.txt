Abstract    :
                We propose the development of a new instrument which builds  upon  established
              institutional strengths and combines the  advantages of  fluorescence lifetime
              measurements with those of two-photon  excitation  microscopy. Lifetime
              measurements also provide the  opportunity to study  the rotational mobility of
              a fluorescence lifetime probe  using time  resolved emission anisotropy
              (providing the lifetime of the  excited  state is long enough), and can also be
              used to gain  information about  the kinetics and degree of interaction of
              cellular  constituents on a  molecular scale. Two-photon excitation microscopy
              provides  the  advantages of greatly reduced photobleaching and photodamage 
              greater  detection efficiency and deeper penetration into tissue  specimens.
              The  proposed instrument will thus provide the unique advantage  of  generating
              2- or 3-dimensional maps of the fluorescence  lifetime with  high spatial and
              temporal resolution and minimal  phototoxicity.    There is a pressing need for
              instrumentation that will allow  the real  time observation of the molecular
              activity of cells and  tissues under  native conditions. The proposed
              instrumentation will provide  new views  of physically distinct environments
              within living cells,  tissue and  whole embryos. The availability of such
              instrumentation will  provide  many benefits to the large number of academic,
              medical and  industrial  scientists.
