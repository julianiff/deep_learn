Abstract    :
                PI:  DAVID ACKERLY  PROPOSAL:  IBN96-04030    This project will investigate
              the physiology, growth and population biology of palms in the genus
              Chamaedorea.  In Guatemala and southern Mexico, the leaves of these species are
              harvested by local communities for sale as greenery in the international
              florist industry.  The research will address the effects of leaf harvesting at
              three different levels:  1) individual leaf physiology and carbon gain, 2)
              plant growth and leaf production, and 3) population dynamics (e.g. seed
              production, and mortality).  Long-term experiments with different levels of
              leaf removal will be established  in the field, at the Chajul Biological
              Reserve in southern Mexico, and in the greenhouse at Stanford University.  This
              research will provide a significant contribution to ecological research by
              linking leaf, individual and population responses in a single experiment
              system.  In addition, the results will be used to evaluate the sustainability
              of leaf harvesting practices at the individual and population level. 
              Sustainable harvesting of Chamaeodorea palms will contribute to rain forest
              conservation by providing an economic incentive for maintaining the population
              and the forest environment in which they occur.
