Abstract    :
                    PI: Gibson  IBN: 9604668    This project will investigate the relationship
              between  social behavior and genetic relatedness in lek-breeding  bird, the
              Sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus).  This  species serves as a model
              system for the analysis of mate  choice (sexual selection) in animals because
              breeding takes  place at easily-observed  leks , spatially-predictable  groups
              of males visited by females for mating.  The study  will isolate polymorphic
              DNA markers from sag grouse blood  that can be used to measure paternity and
              relatedness, and  use these markers to (I) test inferences about paternity of 
              broods derived from behavioral observations, and (II) survey  patterns of
              genetic relatedness within and among natural  social groups.  This research
              involves a combination of  observational field studies and genetic analysis in
              the  laboratory.  The results will address fundamental questions  about the
              biological basis of choice behavior in animals.
