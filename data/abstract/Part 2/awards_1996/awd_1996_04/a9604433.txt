Abstract    :
                   Inside the nose of mammals, the sheet of cells that contains olfactory  
              receptors also contains many sustentacular cells.  The function of these  
              sustentacular cells is not well understood, but their secretions may modulate
              the   handling of odorant molecules in the moist coating of the epithelium. 
              There now   an active interest in how functions of receptors in chemosensory
              tissues are   influenced by such peri-receptor mechanisms.  This limited study
              is a Minority   Research Planning Grant that uses molecular tools to identify
              gene expression,   and so clarify mechanisms by which the proteins produced by
              these cells are   regulated.       Results will have an impact on chemosensory
              research by laying groundwork   for further analysis of this important class of
              cells.  By helping to establish an   independent career for a young
              investigator, teacher and mentor from a group   that remains underrepresented
              in science, this award also will have an impact on   the infrastructure of
              science and education.
