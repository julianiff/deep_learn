Abstract    :
              This proposal is for funds to upgrade an existing 2-channel 500 MHz NMR 
              spectrometer to a 4  channel spectrometer with triple-axis gradients,
              high-order shims,  shaped pulses and new  probes, within the Center for NMR
              Spectroscopy at Washington State  University. The WSU  NMR Center is a central
              University facility, currently with three NMR  spectrometers, newly  remodeled
              space for 5 spectrometers, and a Ph.D.-level Facility  Manager. The Center
              services 13  Departments in 4 Colleges at WSU, with a typical annual usage by
              some  100 students, postdocs  and faculty. The research described here build on
              existing strengths at  WSU, and in particular  within the Departments of
              Biochemistry/Biophysics and of Chemistry, and  represents a major  initiative
              to establish the area of structural biology at WSU. The  projects in this
              proposal, the  majority of which are funded by NSF, include the use of high
              resolution  liquids NMR to the  study of enzymatic reaction mechanisms; the
              application of standard  triple resonance 3D and 4D  NMR to the structure
              determination of a protein-DNA complex, a complex  of a partially  unfolded
              protein with a chaperone, and a protein-RNA complex; the  application of 
              paramagnetic relaxation effect studies to characterize a ligand-enzyme 
              complex; and the  application of gradient-induced diffusion-filtered triple
              resonance NMR  to locate bound water  molecules in a model iron-sulfur protein,
              and use of 2D selective  excitation experiments to  characterize synthetic
              natural product diastereomers.
