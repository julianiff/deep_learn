Abstract    :
              Reynolds  9604931    The disappearance of the natural biota is especially 
              apparent in Vietnam.  Few collections have been made form  this region of SE
              Asia.  Knowledge of the apparently rich  endemism and high diversity is very
              incomplete.  The canopy  of this and other tropical regions is a distinctive
              habitat  for large numbers of nonvascular cryptogams.  The focus of  this work
              is an inventory of these organisms that will  reveal the distribution patterns
              and the taxic diversity of  bryophytes and phylloplane fungi.  The
              collaborators on this  project are at the University of  Hanoi and the
              University  of Cantho.  This award supports a planning visit to Vietnam  to
              undertake face to face discussions with the new contacts,  to discuss the
              details of the proposed project, to evaluate  local resources and study sites,
              to arrange logistics, and  to generate a written understanding for a
              collaborative  study of the forest canopy bryophytes and phylloplane fungi  of
              Vietnam.
