Abstract    :
              Hedgecock  96-04145      The life history of an animal describes the sequence of
              global developmental stages from egg to adult. The most dramatic event is the
              transition from embryonic to larval development. Larval organ systems undergo
              coordinated growth and possibly remodeling at specific stages. The adult stage
              itself may have early and late components associated with reproductive
              senescence or increased mortality. Dr. Hedgecock proposes to characterize a
              novel family of nuclear receptor genes, designated ESCKA, implicated in life
              history regulation. Endocrine tissues secrete long-range chemical signals, or
              hormones, to coordinate development over large regions. Many hormones,
              typically steroids or other lipophilic molecules, act through an ancient family
              of proteins called nuclear receptors. In the model Caenorhabditis elegans,
              which is a nonparasitic nematode, the ESCKA receptor gene daf-12 is required to
              coordinate development of the entire organism at specific life stage
              transitions. He believes the proteins made by this gene, plus two other ESCKA
              genes discovered in this organism, provide tissues throughout the animal with a
              means of 'remembering" their current developmental age. Moreover, hormonal
              activation of these nuclear hormone receptors may allow these diverse cells to
              advance in unison to new stages in the nematode life history. Interesting, at
              least one ESCKA gene has been identified in insects, suggesting this family of
              nuclear receptors can tell us about life history regulation in all higher
              animals.
