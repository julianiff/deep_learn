Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry at UNC-CH proposes to establish a  laboratory for
              molecular modeling and simulation in support of a wide  range of biologically
              related projects, many of which have NSF support.  The proposed computing
              facility would consist of a six processor SGI  R10000 Challenge server, a
              single processor SGI R4400 Solid Impact  workstation and a HP color/bw printer.
              The system planned would have  adequate memory and disk storage to provide for
              molecular dynamics  simulations on very large solvated biomolecular systems and
              electronic  structure calculations on large molecular systems some of which
              include  transition metals ions. The workstation will provide for high 
              resolution molecular graphics to support the planned research. Software 
              necessary to accomplish molecular graphics, molecular modeling and  electronic
              structure calculations is also included.
