Abstract    :
                    This proposal requests funds to purchase equipment that will  benefit a
              diverse group of researchers at Texas A&M University.  Sequencing equipment
              requested consists of: a Perkin Elmer 377-01 ABI  Prism Automated DNA Sequencer
              & Plates; a Perkin Elmer Stretch Upgrade  for the existing Model 373A Automated
              Sequencer & Plates; a Beckman  384-Pin Tool & Kit for an existing BioMek 2000
              robot, and an HP Deskjet  855CXi Color Printer. For downstream analysis, the
              following equipment  for imaging and data recording is requested: a Zeiss
              Axioplan 2  Microscope; a Meyer Instruments Color Chilled 3-Chip CCD Camera and
               Imaging System; CCD Camera software, firmware and connective computer 
              hardware for PC & Mac and a Pentium P586/166 Computer to run the CCD  camera.  
                   The listed equipment is requested to facilitate research in  animal, plant
              and microbial science undertaken by several members of  the Department of
              Biology. Additionally, the facilities of the Gene  Technologies Laboratory
              (GTL) which is a service entity within the  Institute of Developmental and
              Molecular Biology (IDMB), is available  to all members of the Texas A&M
              University community. Since the use of  the available DNA sequencing facilities
              has reached saturation level,  studies of the named researchers, and others,
              will be inhibited unless  additional equipment is acquired. There is a
              widespread need to  characterize the functionality of many of the isolated
              genes. Our  present imaging facilities provide only limited resources towards
              this  need and acquisition of the requested equipment would represent an 
              important step towards enabling the IDMB to provide services for  downstream
              analysis that will complement those of the present  sequencing service. The
              requested items represent more sophisticated  equipment than can usually be
              acquired by an individual PI's  laboratory, and will greatly enhance the
              quality of data gathering and  reporting.
