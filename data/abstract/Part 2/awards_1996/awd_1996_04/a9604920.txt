              9604920  Howard  Description:  This award supports the U.S.-  India Cooperative
              Research: Analysis of  Kodikanal Solar Images, Award in U.S. and  Indian
              Currency.  The collaborators are Robert  Howard, National Solar Observatory,
              Tucson,  Arizona and K.R. Sivaraman, Indian Institute of  Astrophysics,
              Bangalore, India.  The  researchers will use two unique data sets, the 
              Kodaikanal and Mount Wilson sunspot data.  The  Kodaikanal data go back to
              1906.  These data  sets constitute a particularly valuable set of  fundamental
              data on solar surface motions.   Using the combined data, the investigators
              will  study solar surface motions that are important  for answering many
              unsolved questions about the  solar dynamo processes within the sun.  The use 
              of complementary data will greatly improve the  precision with which to infer
              subsurface  physical conditions related to the solar  activity cycle.    
              Scope:  This project supports a collaboration  between two highly competent
              solar astronomers  and deals with a difficult but important  scientific
              problem.  Solar astronomy is a field  of Indian strength.  This award supports
              the  analysis of data collected under a project  previously supported by the
              Division of  International Programs (INT).  The project is  mutually beneficial
              and meets INT criteria for  support.      ***
