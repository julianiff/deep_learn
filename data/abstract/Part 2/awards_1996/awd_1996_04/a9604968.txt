Abstract    :
              ***  Thews  Opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in  ongoing
              research projects in experimental physics are  structured in a summer REU
              program at the University of  Arizona.  Students may choose from a wide variety
              of  forefront physics activities, under the direction of senior  faculty
              members from the Department of Physics.  The main  student audience will be
              those who have finished the  equivalent of the first or second year curriculum
              in science  or engineering at Pima Community College, in preparation for 
              transfer to a 4-year degree program.  This program is also  available to
              similarly prepared students from regions  outside southern Arizona who will be
              resident in Tucson  during the summer.  Graduate Teaching Assistants from the 
              physics department serve as mentors for the students.  Special orientation and
              skills activities are individually  tailored to enable the students to continue
              their  associations with the research project after the completion  of  the
              summer REU program, most often as paid laboratory  associates.  Recruitment
              activities place special emphasis  on women and underrepresented minorities. 
              Because most  students will start in this program at a very early point in 
              their scientific education, we encourage continuity in their  development by
              allowing past participants to apply for  admission in subsequent summer
              sessions.  ***
