Abstract    :
              9604134  Hildebrand    Many insects, including significant agricultural pests,
              use  their olfactory system to recognize and select plants for  egg-laying
              sites and food. This multidisciplinary project  analyzes the way volatile
              chemicals emitted by plants are  used by insects to do this. Parallel studies
              analyze the  release and chemical composition of plant chemicals and 
              investigate the behavior of insects during odor guided  recognition,
              orientation, and flight towards plants or their  released chemicals. This
              project is one of the very few to  address the important issue of insect-plant
              interactions  comprehensively with attention given to the biology of  plants,
              the chemistry of plant compounds, and the behavior  and neurobiology of
              insects. Findings of this research will  benefit ongoing basic research into
              plant chemistry and into  the way organisms recognize, analyze, and respond to
              complex  odors. It addition, the project should yield insights into 
              insect-plant interactions that will be useful in the  agricultural arena for
              designing new strategies for  protection of crop plants from insect predation.
