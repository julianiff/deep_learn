Abstract    :
              Abstract  9604589  Miller      This research is  concerned with the B-G family
              of highly  polymorphic genes which are located in the major  histocompatibility
              complex, and which may represent one of the  elements in vertebrate immune
              defense particularly subject to  specialization and evolutionary change. B-G
              genes have been  detected in only a few species, and have been examined in the 
              chicken.  This gene family encodes surface molecules that have a  structures
              suggesting a receptor/signaling function.  B-G gene  expression in the chicken
              indicates that some of the genes of  this group are expressed together in a
              tissue specific manner.  The experiments here will look at the patterns of
              expression of  the B-G molecules in the chicken, the sequence differences  in 
              the intracellular and extracellular portions of the molecules,  and the ability
              of these molecules to enhance the immune  response. These experiments will
              provide information about  another poorly studied component of the immune
              system and its  function in the chicken.  %%%  These experiments are dealing
              with a group of genes which are  present within the major histocompatibility
              complex of some  species, and which are important in the immune response. This 
              work will be done in chickens and will provide information about  the immune
              system of other species.                      ***
