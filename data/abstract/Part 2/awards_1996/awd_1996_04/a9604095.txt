Abstract    :
                 Fundamental for the sense of smell is the molecular binding of odorant 
              molecules to appropriate receptor molecules in chemosensory organs.  Molecular
              techniques recently have allowed identification of the genes encoding odorant
              binding proteins in the vertebrate nose, but we know very little about such
              genes in invertebrates.  Insects have highly sophisticated chemosensory 
              antennae for detecting odorants, but we know very little yet about the
              molecular   receptors used by insects, to compare with vertebrate olfaction. 
              This project  uses molecular biology and antibody labeling techniques to
              isolate the genes for  olfactory receptors in the model system of a moth
              antenna.     Results will be extremely important for understanding insect
              olfaction, and so have will impact beyond neuroscience to evolutionary and
              environmental biology and to agriculture.
