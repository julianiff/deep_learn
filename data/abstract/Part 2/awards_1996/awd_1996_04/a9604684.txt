Abstract    :
              Abstract  96-04684  PI:  Joseph F. Labuz, University of Minnesota "Behavior of 
              Rock in Multi-Axial States of Stress"      This CONACyT award supports a
              collaborative research project  planned between faculty at the University of
              Minnesota and  the Engineering Institute of the National Autonomous  University
              of Mexico.  The project will combine analytical  modeling from Mexico and
              experimental testing and field  monitoring from Minnesota.  The project is
              associated with  work currently underway under NSF grant CMS-9532061 entitled 
              "Assessing the Onset of Failure Through Acoustic Emissions."    The research
              involves multi-axial compression testing of  soft rock-like materials,
              establishing the peak and post-  peak behavior and shear strength parameters,
              and using  acoustic emission techniques to monitor an excavation likely  to
              develop failure or progressive failure during  construction.  A novel piece of
              equipment, the University of  Minnesota Plane-Strain Apparatus will be used in
              the  testing.    ****
