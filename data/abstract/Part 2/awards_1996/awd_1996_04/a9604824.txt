Abstract    :
              Blood vessels in vertebrates have a thin lining of cells termed the endothelium,
              which was generally thought to provide little more than some protection against
              the adhesion of blood cells (RBCs, platelets, etc.) to the vascular smooth
              muscle which underlies the endothelium on the vessel wall.  However, in recent
              years, it has become apparent that endothelial cells produce a variety of
              chemical messengers that no only protect against blood clotting but also
              control the diameter of the vessel itself by stimulating contraction or
              relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle.  The most famous of these is the
              so-called "endothelium-derived relaxing factor", which is not thought to be
              nitric oxide.  This gas is now considered to be the dominant EDRF in mammals,
              despite the fact that the endothelial cells produce other dilatory substances,
              such as the prostaglandins PGI2 and PGE.   Dr. Evans' preliminary evidence has
              shown that this may not be the case in early vertebrates such as the dogfish
              shark.  In this species, the endothelial nitric oxide system appears to be
              absent, and PGE, not PGI2, appears to be the only EDRF.  The PI is interested
              in delineating the evolution of the EDRF control system, determining which it
              appeared and what role it plays in cardiovascular control in various groups of
              fishes.  This NSF award will allow him to make these determinations.
