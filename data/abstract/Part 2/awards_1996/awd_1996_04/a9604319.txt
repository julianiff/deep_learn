Abstract    :
                    Funds  are requested to purchase a rotating anode X-ray generator  in
              order to measure  diffraction data from biological macromolecular crystals.
              This  instrument will provide a  source of X-rays urgently needed for our
              existing imaging plate  detector system and will  directly support the research
              of 3 major investigators as well as  instruction in protein  crystallography.
              Projects that will utilize this X-ray source include  DNA methylation; the 
              bleomycin hydrolases and their complexes; transcription complexes; and  RNA
              splicing  factors, for all of which crystals are currently available.         
              The crystal structures elucidated in the course of these projects  will 
              provide  structural frameworks, along with  the  biochemical  and  genetic  
              studies,  for  interpreting  the  functional  and   molecular  properties  of 
              this  diverse range of biochemically  and  biomedically  significant
              macromolecules. In addition, the equipment is necessary for  teaching  an
              advanced course in macromolecular crystallography  offered  in  the fall of
              every year at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory as well  as  training  our  own 
              graduate  students and  postdoctoral  fellows.  The  advanced course in
              macromolecular crystallography has a wide impact  on  the  field of structural
              biology and thus in addition to its importance  for the specific
              crystallographic studies described here, the value  of  a  properly  operating 
              X-ray facility to the field  of  macromolecular  crystallography in general
              would be substantial.
