Abstract    :
              9604398  Estelle  The long-term goal of the proposed work is to understand plant
              growth and development as they are regulated by the hormone, auxin. 
              Specifically, the work focuses on auxin transport mechanisms and the regulation
              of auxin movement through the plant.  A large number of Arabidopsis mutants
              with defective or altered auxin distribution and transport characteristics are
              available.    The proposal is based on the order of mutants at different points
              in the transport process, as revealed by altered responses to inhibitors of
              auxin transport - several mutants will be characterized beyond the effects they
              have on cell, tissue, and organ morphology and development.  The proposed
              experiments include biochemical studies to gauge auxin binding, and
              measurements of auxin (IAA) transport and distribution.  Also included is the
              analysis of known auxin-regulated genes in the mutants.  Finally, the
              microscopic analysis of the expression of several of the transcripts and
              proteins that have been mutated will be analyzed and additional genes will be
              cloned.  The proposed work represents a large body of work - the goals are
              selected to provide a complete picture of the movement of auxin from the shoot
              meristem to root cells in plants.
