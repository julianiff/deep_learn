Abstract    :
                  9604231  Blonder    Lay Abstract         Identification and understanding of
              the emotional  content of faces and language are essential part of human 
              cognition and behavior. As yet, there is little  understanding of the brain
              areas that underlie the  interpretation of emotion expressed in facial
              expressions or  in words. This project addresses this fundamental problem 
              using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to map patterns  of activity in the
              human brain associated with this process.  A series of studies describe the
              neuroanatomical circuits  that underlie the recognition of emotional content in
              facial  expression and speech and examines how the brain organizes  and
              processes different types of emotional information. The  project exploits a
              powerful technological development in  neuoimaging to increase our knowledge of
              how the normal  human brain processes and analyzes emotional information.
