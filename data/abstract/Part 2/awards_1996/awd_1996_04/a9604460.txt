Abstract    :
              9604460  Phinney  The overall research goal of this laboratory is to understand
              the biochemical, genetic and molecular basis for gibberellin (GA)-dependent
              shoot growth in maize. The program is important to the advancement of science
              in that the results define control elements for the growth of maize, an
              important economic plant for the welfare of society. Gibberellins are plant
              hormones that are controllers of shoot growth. They are present throughout the
              plant kingdom. The Principal Investigator (PI) has pioneered the use of single
              gene mutants to unravel the details of the GA-biosynthetic pathway; these
              mutants have also been used to evaluate the biological significance of specific
              gibberellins in their control of growth. The projected program will continue
              studies on the gibberellins of maize which will (i) define the biosynthetic
              origin and metabolism of specific maize gibberellins, (ii) locate specific
              steps in the pathway that are blocked by dwarf mutants (GA-mutants) and (iii)
              screen for transposon tagged GA-dwarf mutants with a goal of cloning and
              expressing the genes that control steps in the maize biosynthetic pathway.    
              This project addresses the biological routes for synthesis of gibberellins,
              plant hormones that regulate shoot growth. The way gibberellins are made in
              corn will be studied using combination of chemical and genetic experimental
              approaches. The work is important because it will lead to a greater
              understanding of how plant growth is controlled. This work has both basic and
              practical importance and may eventually lead to increased crop productivity and
              an increase in the world's food supplies.
