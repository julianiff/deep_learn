Abstract    :
              Two-photon excitation, using a red to infrared  wavelength femtosecond laser, is
              a newly-developed  technique that overcomes some of the problematic  features
              of conventional confocal laser scanning  microscopy.  This is joint proposal by
              a group of 17  developmental and cell biologists at UCSD to acquire a 
              two-photon laser scanning microscope (TPLSM) for  monitoring the dynamics of
              cellular and subcellular  events in living cells and organisms.
