Abstract    :
                          Grabel  9604367    The long term goals of this investigation are to
              identity the genes involved in making, early lineage decisions during mammalian
              embryogenesis and to define how the products of these genes interact.   Dr.
              Grabel propose that the Indian hedgehog (Ihh) gene is involved in initiating
              both extraembryonic endoderm and mesoderm differentiation. Evidence accumulated
              by us using the P9 teratocarcinoma system, as well as ES cells and mouse
              blastocyst cultures, suggests a role for Ihh in establishing extraernbryonic
              endoderm. Proposed studies will substantiate this role, begin to define the
              molecular mechanism of action of Ihh in early mouse embryogenesis, and
              determine if mesoderm induction involves Ihh action.   Specific Aims are:  1.
              To substantiate the role of Ihh in extraembryonic endoderm differentiation.
              These studies will include  situ hybridization analyses and
              immunocytochemistry, generating an Ihh-deficient P9 cell line by targeted
              mutagenesis, and testing the effect of hh peptides.  2. To identify gene
              products involved in the hh signaling pathway active during early mouse
              embryogenesis. These studies will test the role of the patched (ptc) gene and
              of protein kinase A as downstream mediators of Ihh.  3. To determine if Ihh
              provides a signal that acts via BMP-2 or BMP-4 to induce mesoderrn.  Hedgehog
              genes clearly play a critical role in patterning the embryo. These studies
              promise to define the role of Ihh in signaling the earliest lineage decision in
              the  mammalian embryo, distinguishing embryonic from extraembryonic and
              establishing primary germ layers.
