Abstract    :
              Funds are requested for the acquisition of a stopped-flow spectrometer  for
              absorbance, circular dichroism and fluorescence measurements.  Projects will be
              conducted by six major users from the Departments of  Physiology & Biophysics
              and Chemistry. The instrument will be used in  investigations of protein
              folding, enzyme mechanisms, peptide and  protein interactions with membranes.
              Prof. McLaughlin will study the  interactions of the proteins Src and MARCKS
              with membranes. Prof.  Miller will study the folding and assembly of
              multidomain proteins.  Prof. Raleigh will use this instrumentation to help
              elucidate the  folding pathway of two proteins. Prof. Sampson will study the
              mechanism  of the important enzyme cholesterol oxidase.  Prof. Scarlata will 
              investigate the activation of phospholipase C by G proteins. Prof.  Wishina
              will study the dynamics of molten globule states of proteins.  The instrument
              will be housed in a shared instrumentation laboratory  located in the Chemistry
              Department and operated as a user-accessible,  operator maintained shared
              facility.
