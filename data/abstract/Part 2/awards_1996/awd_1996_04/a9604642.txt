Abstract    :
                   The middle ear is the chamber containing the tiny bones that link the
              eardrum   to the neuronal structures of the inner ear.  Its mechanical
              performance is a   major factor determining hearing range and sensitivity.  We
              know very little   about how middle ear anatomy in different mammals may be
              adaptively   specialized for different environments.  This interdisciplinary
              collaborative study   combines a bioengineering and theoretical approach with
              comparative anatomy   to derive and test models for middle ear mechanics. 
              Hearing physiology is well   known for the domestic cat, but the whole cat
              family (Felidae) includes a large   range of sizes and a wide diversity of
              habitats.  This work compares the anatomy   across a range of felids to obtain
              precisely measured dimensions, mathematical   scaling factors for size, and
              construction of models of acoustical mechanics.   Predictions from these models
              will be tested by non-invasive recordings from   diverse representatives,
              including some rare species only available in zoos.       Results will be
              important not only to auditory biology, but to bioengineering   and to
              evolutionary biology.
