Abstract    :
              9604287  Karr  The proposed research investigates the effect of a bacterial
              infection on reproductive success of the host it infects.  Because the bacteria
              influences reproduction, it profoundly impacts both the population and
              evolutionary biology of its host.  The bacterium, Wolbachia, reduces or
              abolishes the ability of male hosts to father offspring with uninfected
              females.  Research preliminary to this proposal establishes that mild heat
              shock such as that encountered in the wild can reduce the reproductive
              incompatibility.  The research would: (1) Determine the frequency with which D.
              simulans larvae naturally experience heat shock; (2) Determine the range of
              temperatures and the developmental stages at which the incompatibility can be
              cured; (3) Distinguish whether CI-abatement occurs via outright
              killing/suppression of Wolbachia and/or is mediated by increased expression of
              heat-shock proteins; (4) Experimentally examine whether natural heat shock
              actually cures the reproductive incompatibility in natural populations.  The
              proposed research promises to integrate diverse aspects of ecological and
              evolutionary physiology, reproductive biology, molecular biology, population
              biology, and bacteriology, and is likely to yield results significant to each
              of these areas.  Ultimately, this information could be useful for the rational
              design of new forms of biological pest control.
