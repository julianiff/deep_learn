Abstract    :
              Working with others, we developed biospecific self-assembled  monolayer (SAM)
              chips that increased, by more than an order  of magnitude, the sensitivity,
              accuracy, and range of  measurements made with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) 
              instruments. We have extended the strategies developed for  our biospecific
              nitrilotri-acetic acid (NTA) SAM chips to  the development of a DNA presenting
              monolayer chip. This new  chip should extend the sensing enhancements
              demonstrated by  the NTA-SAM to the study of DNA-protein complex  interactions.
              We will also explore how a highly ordered  surface of known structure might be
              used to probe  macromolecules of unknown structure. SPR determined kinetic 
              measurements will be calibrated against solution based  measurements obtained
              with fluorescence anisotropy. As with  the development of the NTA-SAM, we will
              employ the power of  genetics to assess the accuracy of our experimental 
              surfaces. We have available arrays of well characterized  proteins and variants
              thereof, whose activation potential  can be measured in vivo, so that the
              relevance of in vitro  measurements can be ascertained.
