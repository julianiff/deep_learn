Abstract    :
              9604833  Graumlich  Description:  This award supports the U.S.-  Nepal Workshop:
              Dynamics of Land-Use/Land-Cover  Change in the Hindu-Kush Himalaya, April 1997,
               Kathmandu.  The conveners, Lisa Graumlich,  University of Arizona and Sharad
              Adhikary,  Himalayan Climate Center, Kathmandu will  assemble a group of U.S.
              and Asian researchers  from the social sciences, biophysical sciences,  and
              remote sensing to evaluate the impact of  land-use/land-cover change on the
              environment  and global climate.     Scope:  The principal purpose of the joint
               workshop is to evaluate the state of knowldege  for the HKH region and to
              describe a plan of  action for the development of key  interdisciplinary,
              integrative studies that  will allow credible projection of future  changes. 
              The Himalayan Climate Center is the  principal promoter of research on climate
              and  environment in the Himalayan region.   Proceedings of the workshop
              including review  articles and contributed papers will be  published.  ***
