Abstract    :
              9604555  Ashe    Everyday limb movements can be described both in terms of  the
              forces that the muscles produce and in terms of the more  spatial, descriptive
              aspects of the movement such as  trajectory, direction, position, and velocity.
              The brain  controls all aspects of limb movement, but it is not known  how the
              brain codes the different aspects of movement. The  basis of this project is
              the hypothesis that the brain  controls both muscle force generated during a
              movement and  the spatial aspects of that movement together by regulating  the
              stiffness (force/position), viscosity (force/velocity)  and inertia
              (force/acceleration) of a moving limb. To test  this, the project monitors the
              activity of cells in the  motor control area of the brain during the execution
              of a  trained arm movement performed under different conditions.  Sophisticated
              statistical techniques developed by the  experimenters are then used to extract
              the rules used by  cells in this brain area to control arm movements. Potential
               long-term significance of this work includes the application  of the
              understanding of brain codes for movement to the  development of prosthetic
              devices, the treatment of movement  disorders, and the development of robotic
              systems.
