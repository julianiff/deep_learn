Abstract    :
              9604782  DeLong  Reversible protein phosphorylation plays a crucial role in the
              control of cellular processes that govern growth, development and interaction
              with the environment.  The protein kinases and phosphatase establishing a
              pattern of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation must be tightly controlled
              through their presence and activity.  The work focuses on the protein
              phosphatase 2A family in Arabidopsis and utilizes yeast mutants in the
              catalytic and regulatory subunits of PP2A to isolate the plant homologs.  The
              potential usefulness of this yeast complementation approach has been documented
              in preliminary data.  Building on this success the work will characterize the
              plant PP2A and use transgenic plants to affect the amount, location, and
              activity of PP2A in whole plants.  The results, considering that very little
              information is available for plants, are expected to shed light on the
              multitude of PP2A isoforms and their various functions at the cellular, tissue
              and whole plant levels.
