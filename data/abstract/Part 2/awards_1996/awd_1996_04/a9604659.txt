              ABSTRACT  9604659  WALTHALL   The production of a functional neural circuit
              begins with the differentiation of nerve cells and ends with synaptic
              communication between cells.  Comparative studies of the mechanisms and
              molecules that orchestrate cellular differentiation and that mediate
              communication at synapses have revealed a tremendous amount of conservation
              across evolutionarily diverse animals.  Much less is known about a critical
              intervening step, the selective formation of synapses as the circuit is
              assembled.  The award will allow Dr. Walthall and his students to investigate
              the genetic and molecular mechanisms that create the synaptic patterns that
              distinguish two related classes of motoneurons in the nematode Caenorhabditis
              elegans.  Unique features of C. elegans make it ideal for an experimental
              approach that integrates the roles of genetic and cellular programs involved in
              establishing orderly synaptic patterns.  Two classes of locomotory neurons in
              C. elegans, the dorsal D motoneurons (DD mns) and the ventral D motoneurons (VD
              mns), make up a cross-inhibitory network that plays a critical role in the
              animal's serpentine movements.  The DD and VD motorneurons share many
              structural and neurochemical features, but they are distinguished from one
              another by their synaptic patterns.  The similarities between the two
              motoneuron classes appear to be due to the expression of ge
