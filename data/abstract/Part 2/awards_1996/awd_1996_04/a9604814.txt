Abstract    :
                 Support is requested to purchase an ABI Prism 377 automated DNA  sequencer to
              be used as a primary research tool for five molecular and  evolutionary
              biologists in the Biology Department at Vanderbilt  University.  Our research
              group currently relies heavily on manual  sequencing, but recent research needs
              and new research developments  require the use of high-throughput automated
              sequencing. The ABI Prism  377, which is capable of sustained, accurate data
              throughput of up to  10 times what we can now accomplish, would represent a
              quantum  improvement in research capability for our laboratories.       The
              five PIs / Major Users will conduct a series of projects on the  ABI377
              autosequencer that explore diverse problems in organismal and  molecular
              evolution: 1) Phylogenetic and mechanistic studies of  organelle DNA evolution
              in photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic plants  (dePamph1lis), 2) Molecular
              phylogenetic studies of species  interactions and coevolution (Pellmyr), 3)
              Evolution of genes  underlying circadian clocks in plants and cyanobacteria
              (Johnson),  4)  Organelle DNA polymorphism and the genetics of metapopulations 
              (McCauley), and 5) Evolution of development in chordates (Swalla).
