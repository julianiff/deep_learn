Abstract    :
              9604264  Buchanan  The overall goal of this project is to enhance our
              understanding of seed germination with particular reference to cereals.  In
              both wheat and barley, a ubiquitous regulatory protein, thioredoxin, appears to
              play an important role in triggering mobilization of carbon and nitrogen during
              early stages of germination.  Current evidence indicates that thioredoxin
              exerts its effect in three ways: (1) by reducing major storage proteins thereby
              increasing their susceptibility to proteases; (2) by activating a protease,
              thiocalsin, that is specific for the storage proteins themselves reduced by
              thioredoxin; and (3) by reducing and thereby inactivating disulfide proteins
              that inhibit individual enzymes which affect carbohydrate breakdown.  The goals
              of the present study are to complete our projects on (1) the protein found in
              our earlier NSF-supported research to inhibit pullulanase, an enzyme
              responsible for breaking down starch during germination, and (2) protein redox
              changes occurring during development of wheat.
