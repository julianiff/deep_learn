Abstract    :
                                        Abstract                                              
                                      This proposal has been developed to replace and expand 
              growth facilities that were purchased more than 20 years  ago.  These present
              facilities have waiting lists for use.  The existing chambers are seriously
              rusting and the lighting  and control systems have constant problems and even 
              occasional short circuits that have started fires.  Futhermore, they have
              inefficient control systems and  utilize city water for cooling.  Modern
              proportional control  systems operated with central chilled water cooling will 
              provide significant energy conservation.  Thus, these old  units can meet only
              a portion of the needs of the research  of this decade and succeeding decades
              as detailed in this  project.
