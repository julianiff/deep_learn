Abstract    :
              9604476  Grodzicker  This service to the plant biology community provides
              continued funds for support of the Cold Spring Harbor Course on "Arabidopsis
              Molecular Genetics".  In this course, to be held for three weeks in the summer
              of each year, plant biologists will be provided hands-on experience in
              techniques of molecular analysis of plants, with a strong emphasis, but not
              exclusively, on working with Arabidopsis as a model.  Concepts are transmitted
              through intensive lectures and discussion periods by invited speakers which
              deal with their specialty area.  The value of the course lies in the training
              of young scientists who often continue to collaborate for years after they
              attended this course and in its function in the dissemination of new techniques
              and conceptual approaches to study plants.
