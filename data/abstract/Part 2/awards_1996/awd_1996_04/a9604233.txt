Abstract    :
              IBN-9604233  Curras    The task of the nervous system is to receive, send,
              process,  store, and retrieve information.  Communication between  neurons are
              accomplished through electrical and chemical  signals.  Glutamate is a
              neurotransmitter which serves as a  chemical messenger in transmitting
              excitatory information  between neuronal connections known as synapses.  It is 
              released into synaptic space, diffuses across the narrow  gap, and binds to
              specific protein receptors.  NMDA (N-  methyl-D-aspartate) is a class of
              glutamate receptor that is  involved in fundamental processes like development
              of the  brain  and learning and memory as well as brain disorders  such as
              epilepsy and excitotoxic neurodegeneration.  Recently,  molecular cloning
              studies have identified five  subunits which can be used to form NMDA
              receptors.  Dr.Curras is using state-of-the-art electrophysiological, 
              molecular-pharmacological, and anatomical technology to  first identify the
              subunit composition in individual neurons  and then to delinate each subunit's
              contribution to the NMDA  receptor function and NMDA-mediated processes.  She
              will  examine the NMDA receptor properties in magnocellular  neurosecretory
              neurons located in the supraoptic nucleus of  the hypothamus.  This brain
              region produces and releases  vasopressin, an antidiuretic hormone essential
              for body  water regulation.   Dr. Curras will determine the changes in  subunit
              expression of these neurons under various  physiological conditions.  These
              results will  provide novel  information on how specific NMDA receptor
              phenotypes  contribute to the plasticity displayed by these neurons in  order
              to adapt to different physiological processes. It will  not only lead to a
              better general understanding of how  neurons communicate but will help define
              the relation  between NMDA receptors, neuroendocrine function and  regulation,
              and water balance.
