Abstract    :
                    K.A. Feldmann  9604439    A collection of dwarf (cell elongation) mutants
              have been isolated from T-DNA and EMS mutagenized populations. They have been
              mapped to seven complementation groups (dwfl -dwf7); in three of these (dwfl,
              dwf3, and dwf4) there is at least one allele that cosegregates with a T-DNA.
              Recently, three dwarfs, dwfl, det2 (dwf6) and cpd (dwf3) were shown to be
              complemented by the exogenous application of brassinolide (BL). The dwarf
              phenotype in all the other dwarfs except dwf2 (bri) was also complemented by
              BL. Sequences of cloned dwarf genes (DEI2, CPD and to a lesser extent DWFI)
              indicate that they are involved in BL biosynthesis. bri
              (brassinolide-insensitive) is hypothesized to be a receptor for BL. This leaves
              three BL-complemented loci, DWF4, DWFS and DWF7, that remain largely
              uncharacterized at any level. The collection of dwarfs described here very
              likely represents near saturation of the Arabidopsis genome for this type of
              dwarf phenotype.  The objectives of this proposal include: 1) saturation of the
              Arabidopsis genome for brassinosteroid-related dwarfs; identify interacting
              loci; 2) further characterization of dwfS, dwf6 and dwp (morphology, anatomy,
              and physiology); 3) test hypotheses about BL biosynthesis by examining double
              and multiple mutants of all six BL-responsive dwarfs; 4) identify and
              characterize full length DWF4 cDNA and genomic clones utilizing a 3' genomic
              clone from a T-DNA tagged mutant; this includes sequencing several alleles and
              molecular complementation; 5) define the tissues in which DWF4 is expressed and
              localized; 6) analyze the expression of BL biosynthetic and BL-regulated genes
              in dwis and other cell expansion mutants, and 7) study the effect of ectopic
              expression of BL biosynthesis genes on cell size and morphology.  This analysis
              will allow the development of a more precise biosynthetic model for BL. In
              addition, the cloning of DWF4 will add another molecular tool for studying the
              BL pathway. Completion of these objectives will pro vide substantial
              information on what role brassinosteroids have in cell elongation and other
              processes in plant growth and development.
