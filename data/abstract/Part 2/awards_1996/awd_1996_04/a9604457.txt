Abstract    :
              9604457  Singh      These studies are aimed at understanding the molecular
              mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of potassium currents, which
              are important for many cellular functions.  Larval muscles of Drosophila have
              two voltage activated and two calcium activated potassium currents. Two of
              these channels have been investigated with mutations that selectively disrupt
              them.  This investigator has identified 6 mutations in the other channels: the
              Z66 mutant which disrupts IK, and P40 which affects IA.   This project will
              clone and sequence these genes.  This information will indicate the nature of
              the gene products and whether they are structural subunits of the channels or
              regulators of them. Electrophysiological studies will also be done with the P40
              mutant to confirm the mapping of this gene, and provide information on the
              functioning of IA channels.  These studies will provide important information
              to aid our understanding of these potassium channels.  %%%    K+ channels play
              a key role in a wide variety of cellular processes.  With an excellent
              repertoire of available genetic tools, Drosophila is useful in the study of
              many biological phenomena including ion channel function.  The result of this
              research will aid in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in
              the function and regulation of potassium channels.        ***
