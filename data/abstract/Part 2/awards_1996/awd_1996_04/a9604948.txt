Abstract    :
                The objective of the proposed research is to continue to develop  ultra-high
              resolution, Superconducting Quantum Interference  Device (SQUID) magnetometers
              (UHRSM) that are optimized for the  imaging of the magnetic fields produced by
              action currents,  remanent magnetization, and magnetic susceptibility in
              isolated  living tissue and small experimental animal preparations at the 
              scale of 100 m. Such measurements are not yet in wide spread use,  primarily
              because of the limitations and costs of existing  instrumentation. This project
              is designed specifically to address  these points. The proposed instruments
              will be capable of making  measurements that are impossible with any other
              technique, and  should lead to new insights into cellular biology, 
              electrophysiology, botany, embryology, magnetoreception,  immunodiagnostics,
              and neurophysiology.
