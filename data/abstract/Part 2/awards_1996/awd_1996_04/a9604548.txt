Abstract    :
              Abstract  9604548  Kaattari        The International Society of Developmental
              and  Comparative Immunologists, meets triennially, and is the only
              international organization dedicated to examine the diverse defense mechanisms
              of disparate phylogenetic groups of organisms.  Comparative models in
              immunology attempt to provide a phylogenetic link between the immunity in
              vertebrates with the immunity of invertebrates.  Comparative models may also
              provide unique micro environments to study isolated immune functions. 
              Important discoveries have been made exploiting differences among species, e.g.
              the  function of B cells was first characterized   in birds, while phagocytic
              cells were first observed in sea stars.    In this meeting, which will be held
              in July 1997 in Williamsburg, Virginia, there will be a special emphasis on
              antibody and T cell receptor evolution, newly discovered cytokine-like
              molecules in invertebrates and phylogeny of the immune neuroendocrine immune
              system interactions.        ***
