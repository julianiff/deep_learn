Abstract    :
              9604605  Paterson  The sixth bi-annual Gordon Research Conference on Mammalian
              DNA Repair will be held in Ventura, CA, Feb. 2 - Feb. 7, 1997.  The invited
              speakers are experts in the fields of DNA repair and related cellular processes
              (e.g. DNA replication, transcription, cell cycle control and apoptosis). 
              Besides providing a forum for these experts to present their most recent
              results and ideas, the Conference will facilitate wide-ranging interactions
              among all attendees through plenary discussion sessions and poster
              presentations.  The attendees will be chosen globally from universities,
              research institutes, and government and industrial research labs.  Every effort
              will be made to select a well-balanced mix of individuals ranging from leaders
              in mammalian DNA repair to students and younger scientists new to the field. 
              %%%  This Conference will examine mammalian DNA repair as a key component of
              the genomic surveillance machinery crucial to the overall integrity and
              function of higher organisms.  Recent discoveries have catapulted DNA repair
              into a pivotal position in fundamental biological studies.  ***
