Abstract    :
              9604622  PI:  VanBerkum    After neurons are born, they must extend axons over
              great distances to innervate their target cells.  The tip of the extending
              axon, called the growth cone, detects a variety of molecular cues along its
              path which guide the neuron to its target.  These cues are converted inside the
              neuron into signals regulating axon outgrowth, steering and ultimately the
              formation of a functional connection (a synapse) with a target cell.  Calcium
              ions are critical to this conversion process inside a neuron.  In his previous
              work, Dr. VanBerkum established that the inhibition of calcium signaling in
              selected outgrowing axons causes these axons to stall or follow abnormal
              trajectories.  The goal of the present experiments is to elucidate which
              proteins are used inside the axon to correctly convert calcium-dependent
              guidance information into proper pathway formation.  A combination of cell and
              genetic experiments are being conducted to specifically inhibit individual 
              components of the calcium signaling pathway inside these neurons.  The
              inhibition of a protein component is expected to elicit similar developmental
              defects as previously observed.  Thus the results of these experiments will
              elucidate the molecular mechanism by which calcium regulates the development of
              functional connections in the nervous system.  Moreover, since calcium is also
              used in the adult to modulate synaptic activity, these experiments will shed
              light on how calcium is used during learning and memory.
