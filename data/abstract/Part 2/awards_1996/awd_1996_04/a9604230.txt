Abstract    :
              9604230  Silk    Plant habit, the positioning of plant organs, is in the focus
              of the proposed research.  The work originates from a unified hypothesis, based
              on existing models for the functioning of wood fibers, to explain twining of
              vines and the unique monocot leaf display.  Early in development of a twining
              organ transient axial curvature and torsion are produced by gradients in the
              primary growth rates.    The work focuses on several experimental strategies to
              support and test the central hypothesis.  First, measurements in situ of forces
              that are produced by vines around a supporting pole and measurements of leaf
              curvature in wild type and mutant plants during development are monitored using
              unique equipment.  The data are correlated with fiber production, orientation
              and distribution in the cell walls and measurements of lignification are done.
              Forces of elasticity and  springback  are determined.  Macroscopic measurements
              are correlated with data after ultrastructural analysis.  The results will be
              correlated with light capture by plants.  Results will shed light on how plants
              use changes in habit to optimize their performance under particular
              environmental conditions.
