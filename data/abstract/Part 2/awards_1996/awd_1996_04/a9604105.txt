Abstract    :
                   Visual pigments provide the molecular machinery to  capture the energy of
              light  for detection by photoreceptors of the eye.  Differently  structured
              proteins in the  different pigments confer best sensitivity to different 
              wavelengths of light, and so  to different colors.  We know a great deal about
              color  vision in primates, but  whales and dolphins also are reported to use
              color vision  and we know very little  about their visual adaptations to a
              predominantly blue  underwater world.  This  project uses molecular biology
              techniques to explore the  visual pigment proteins,  called opsins, that are
              used in dolphin vision.  Determining  the genetic sequence  for these opsins
              will provide useful data for comparisons  with terrestrial  mammals and with
              deep-sea fishes, to see what ways visual  pigments may have  evolved adaptively
              to capture the predominant spectral  energies in the marine  environment.    
              Results from this work will be important not only to  visual science, but to
              better  understanding of cetacean biology, the diversity of marine  organisms,
              and  evolutionary biology.
