Abstract    :
              9604124  Barnes  Diadenosine tri- and tetra- phosphates (Ap3A and Ap4A) are
              present in all organisms examined.  They may serve one or more functions, and
              they are degraded by specific enzymes in those organisms.  In humans, a gene
              designated FHIT encodes a candidate tumor suppressor, Fhit.  Fhit is an Ap3A
              hydrolase that catalyzes the degradation of Ap3A.  The goal of this research is
              to determine the catalytic mechanism of specific enzymes from yeast and humans
              that degrade these dinucleotide phosphates.  The hydrolases will be analyzed
              for formation of covalent enzyme intermediates during catalysis as has been
              indicated for Ap4A phosphorylase I.  The amino acid residues required for the
              binding and catalysis of substrate will be identified.  Participation of
              postulated histidine residues and others will be tested by site-directed
              mutagenesis.    Enzymes that process dinucleotide polyphosphates (ApnA) and
              related compounds in yeast and mammals will be examined. The roles of
              dinucleotide polyphosphates in regulation of cell growth and proliferation are
              postulated, but not known. These include, intracellularly, regulation of DNA
              replication and the stress response. Extracellularly,  they act via
              purinogenic-type receptors. This area has become important in the past few
              years with the discovery, by Barnes,  that the tumor suppresser gene FHIT
              encodes an Ap3A hydrolase (Fhit).  Abnormal FHIT transcripts are found in 50%of
              some common cancers. The hydrolase enzymes are a family of nucleotide-binding
              proteins whose catalytic action is likely to be linked to regulation of cell
              proliferation.   ***
