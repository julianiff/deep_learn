Abstract    :
              IBN-9604238  PI:  Jen      During sensory signal processing, the brain has the
              built-in ability to edit and   adjust the flow of information that reaches it. 
              It is known that the cortex has   neural pathways, called corticofugal
              pathways, that descend to influence the   neural activity carrying information
              coming up to the cortex by the ascending   sensory pathways.  We know very
              little about how and when these descending   pathways exert their influence,
              but in the auditory system they are believed to be   important in functions
              such as pattern recognition and localization of acoustic   signals.  This
              project uses a physiological approach to determine how   descending cortical
              pathways can affect the response activity of single auditory   nerve cells in a
              midbrain auditory structure called the superior colliculus.   
              Electrophysiological recordings will examine corticofugal regulation of
              intensity   coding, frequency tuning, and auditory spatial sensitivity of these
              neurons.  This   system may be a way for the brain to 'focus in' on important
              but faint auditory   signals in a noisy environment, for example in
              echolocation behavior.     Results from this work will be important for
              developing a more realistic and   dynamic model of central auditory processing.
               It also will enhance our   understanding of active regulation of signal
              processing by the brain, and so will   have a potential impact on understanding
              other sensory systems, as well as on   fields such as neuroethology, animal
              behavior, and on bioengineering including   development of aids for hearing.
