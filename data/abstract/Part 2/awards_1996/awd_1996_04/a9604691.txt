Abstract    :
              INT 9604691  Weiss      This U.S.-Slovak research project between Dr. Richard
              Weiss of Georgetown University and Dr. Pavol Hrdlovic of the Slovak Academy of
              Sciences' Polymer Institute will feature development of methodologies for
              studying light-induced dynamic processes within polymeric systems. 
              Specifically, the researchers intend to: 1) synthesis cross-linked
              interpenetrating network (IPN) polymers with luminescing reporter groups
              covalently attached at selected sites; 2) form copolymers containing groups
              capable of enhancing or inhibiting direct and molecular oxygen-mediated
              photodegradation; and 3) measure diffusion rates of small guest molecules
              within these polymers.  This cooperative effort builds upon the expertise of
              Dr. Weiss in photochemistry and the Slovak institute's capacity for polymer
              synthesis and is expected to yield new information on polymer photodegradation
              with potential application in industrial materials.    This joint project
              fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
              leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe  to combine
              complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
              competence.    ??
