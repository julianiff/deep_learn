Abstract    :
                9604537  Belanger    Many cultivated and wild grass species are hosts to
              fungal endophytes of the tribe balansieae.  These associations are ecologically
              and agronomically significant, yet little is know about the physiological
              aspects of the interactions.  One benefit for the plant hosts that results from
              the interaction is reduced herbivory due to the production of toxic alkaloids
              by the endophytes.      The investigation targets the physiology of the
              interaction between fungus and host grasses in a model system.  In particular,
              the role of a subtilisin-like proteinase is in the focus of the investigations.
               This protease is an abundant protein only when endophytes are present.  It is
              homologous to proteases that are considered virulence factors in pathogenic
              interactions between fungi and plants.  The focus of the work is on the
              expression of the enzyme, its importance to the mutualistic association and
              evolutionary implications of the protease gene family in relation to
              mutualistic interactions across kingdoms.
