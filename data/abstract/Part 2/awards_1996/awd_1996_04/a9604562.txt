Abstract    :
              9604562  Bennett  This proposal is on research to genetically alter the 
              metabolism of anaerobic solventogenic clostridia  (Clostridium acetobutylicum
              and related species) to  determine their potential applications for producing 
              solvents (butanol and acetone) and other oxychemicals.   This requires further
              understanding of the applied  molecular genetics and associated methods needed
              to  redirect the cellular metabolism.  This research is  aiming to (1)
              establish the techniques needed for the  generation of stable overproducing
              strains (such  strains are necessary for batch or continuous processes  without
              using any antibiotics to maintain genetic  stability), (2) develop a more
              detailed molecular  understanding of the regulation of a cluster of genes 
              known as the sol locus, (3) develop the means which  would allow one to express
              clostridia genes in other  hosts or heterologous genes in clostridia in order
              to  form products not normally produced by the respective  cells, and(4)
              develop additional tools for flexible  carbon-flux control.  Specifically, this
              research will  develop methods needed for:  desirable gene expression  (in
              terms of strength and timing), single or multiple  chromosomal gene
              inactivations in order to inactivate  or eliminate undesirable pathways or
              traits, and stable  chromosomal integration (of one or more copies) of  genes
              in order to increase the protein activities (and  presumably carbon fluxes) of
              desirable pathways.  ***
