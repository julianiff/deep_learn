Abstract    :
              9604977  O'Day    This Americas Program award will fund a 3-year cooperative 
              research project between Dr. Peter O'Day, University of  Oregon, and Dr. Juan
              Bacigalupo, University of Chile,  on a  study of the role of IP3-Receptor in
              visual transduction,  the orchestration of retinal biochemistry that generates 
              visual excitation. The investigators will focus on the  question of how two
              specific biochemical signaling pathways  interact in visual transduction in
              retinal cells from  Drosophila.  Whether direct interaction between the two 
              pathways is fundamental to transduction is an important  question whose
              examination may provide models for other  transducing systems. The researchers
              intend to use  biophysical and biochemical approaches with mutational  analysis
              to examine the connection.    The proposed work is important, not only for
              understanding  the biochemical orchestration of invertebrate visual 
              transduction, but also for bringing out some fundamental  issues of signal
              transduction  The collaboration will  facilitate the exchange of scientific
              information,  technologies, and strategies, thereby enhancing and  broadening
              the experimental approaches available for the  long term programs of both
              groups.    ***
