Abstract    :
              Rapid kinetic analyses are essential for biochemical research Important 
              information on the mechanism and regulation of enzymes, the mechanism  of
              interaction between proteins and nucleic acids, and on the binding  of signal
              transduction molecules (i.e., ligands) to receptor proteins  can be derived
              from the use of stopped-flow spectrophotometry. Most  enzymes have turnover
              numbers between 1 and 106 s-1, which implies that  the rate constants for the
              reactions between intermediates will be  usually greater than 1 s-1 and that
              each step will take less than 1  second to occur. In this proposal we will
              detail the use of rapid  stopped-flow spectrophotometry for the investigation
              of specific  biochemical reactions and the development of a Rapid Kinetics
              Analysis  Center that will facilitate its use and be capable of upgrading the 
              instrumentation.
