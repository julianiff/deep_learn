Abstract    :
              9604563  Raines  This proposal is on research to better understand the 
              disulfide formation process in vivo and to consequently  maximize heterologous
              protein secretion.  In this  context, it is proposed to manipulate oxidative
              folding  in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the yeast  Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae.  Three aspects will be  studied with respect to their effects on
              heterologous  secretion:  (1) optimization of the levels of two key  ER redox
              foldases (PDI, Eug1p), (2) development and  testing of novel small molecule
              redox folding  catalysts, and (3) alteration of the concentration and  redox
              potential of the natural ER small molecular  weight redox buffer, glutathione. 
              The effects of these  manipulations on heterologous secretion will be studied 
              with expression and secretion systems for: bovine  pancreatic trypsin
              inhibitor, a small 58 amino acid  protein with three disulfide bonds, and RNase
              A, a 124-  residue enzyme that contains 4 disulfide bonds.  ***
