Abstract    :
              9604988  Katiyar  Description: This award supports the U.S.-India  Cooperative
              Research: Processing, Properties,  and Characterization of   Ferroelectric
              Films.  The collaborators are  R.S. Katiyar, University of Puerto Rico, S.B. 
              Desu, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and D.C.  Agrawal, Indian Institute of
              Technology,  Kanpur.  The researchers will study thin films  of novel
              optoelectronics and ferroelectrics  with the aim of enhancing understanding of 
              synthesis and processing, materials  characterization and modelling of thin
              film  growth and properties.  Various techniques will  be used to probe the
              micro-to nano-scale  compositions, structure and characterization in  order to
              establish structure-property  relationships in these novel materials.  
              Fundamental research on ferroelectric thin  films holds great potential for
              eventual  application in electro-optical devices,  microwave electronics, micro
              sensors, and high  density packaging.    Scope: This project supports a new 
              collaboration between two U.S. research  institutions and the Indian Institute
              of  Technology, Kanpur.  All facilities are  equipped with state-of-the-art
              instrumentation  for the proposed synthesis, characterization  and modelling
              work.  The research is expected  to stimulate a long-term science and 
              engineering link among three centers-of-  excellence.  The project is mutually
              beneficial  and meets INT criteria for support.     ***
