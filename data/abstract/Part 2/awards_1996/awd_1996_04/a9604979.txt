Abstract    :
                This dissertation enhancement grant supports a US graduate student, Kimberly
              P. Pfeifer, working under the guidance of Dr. Goran Hyden, Professor of
              Political Science at the University of Florida, to do field research in
              Tanzania.  The project will study the Fumba, Chakwa, Nungwi and Mkwajuni
              communities in Zanzibar to determine how they use their ethnic identities to
              influence the development and implementation of sustainable development and
              resource management policies created by Tanzanian state and nongovernmental
              organizations.  The results of this study should provide valuable information
              on ways policy-making organizations can incorporate the concerns of local
              communities into their strategies and policies to address global change
              problems.  The principal methods used will be interviews, focus group sessions,
              and archival research.  Staff members of the Institute of Development Studies
              at the University of Dar es Salaam will collaborate with Ms. Pfeifer on this
              project.  This study will make an important contribution to the understanding
              of how different ethnic groups contribute to the success or failure of national
              policies on conservation and resource distribution and management.  The grant
              will also provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong,
              independent research career.  Funding for this project is being provided by the
              Division of International Programs and by the Division of Social, Behavioral,
              and Economic Research.
