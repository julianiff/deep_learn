Abstract    :
              With the advent of Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) large  stretches of
              DNA can now be readily manipulated  thereby facilitating  MAR mapping. Three
              independent research projects within Massachusetts  General Hospital are
              embarking on such mapping. The first, headed by  Carl S. Shelley, will identify
              the MARs associated with the CD43 gene,  the second, headed by M. Amin Arnaout
              will map those associated with  the genes encoding the, 2 integrin family and
              the third, headed by  Mason W. Freeman, will map the MARs which flank the
              scavenger receptor  gene. The CD43 and alpha chain 2 integrin genes encode
              molecules which  mediate the adhesive functions of leukocytes. Since these
              genes are  clustered on the pll.2 region of chromosome 16, PFGE will also be
              used  by Dr. Shelley's and Dr. Arnaout's groups to generate a physical map of 
              this cluster. It is anticipated that mapping of the MARs within this  cluster
              will define transcriptional domains and provide the basis for  determining the
              molecular mechanisms which in vivo control the  coordinate and differential
              regulation of these functionally related  genes. Drs. Shelley, Arnaout and
              Freeman currently do not have access  to a PFGE system and here funding is
              requested of the National Science  Foundation for its purchase.
