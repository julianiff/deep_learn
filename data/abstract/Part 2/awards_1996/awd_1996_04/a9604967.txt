Abstract    :
                9604967  Barrett    Under this cooperative research project, Dr. Bruce R. 
              Barrett of the University of Arizona and Dr. Serdar Kuyucak  of the Research
              School of Physical Sciences, Australian  National University (ANU), Canberra,
              Australia, will  investigate the M1 properties of rare-earth nuclei within  the
              proton-neutron Interacting Boson Model for even-even  nuclei and the
              proton-neutron Interacting Boson-Fermion  Model for odd-A nuclei utilizing the
              1/N boson-expansion  technique.  The research groups at the University of
              Arizona  and the ANU will be significantly aided in their studies by  close
              interaction with the nuclear experimental research  group at ANU.
