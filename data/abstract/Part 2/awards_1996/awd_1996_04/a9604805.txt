Abstract    :
                         This is a proposal to purchase an optical biosensor    instrument for
              research in molecular and cellular biology.    The proposed instrument uses a
              cuvette-based design to    measure, in real-time, the interaction between
              different    molecules.           The technology is based on an optical
              biosensor which    detects macromolecular binding due to changes in refractive 
                index at the boundary of the biosensor surface. This    instrument permits
              real-time, analysis of molecular    interactions. A variety of molecular
              interactions will be    studied. These include both kinetic and thermodynamic  
               analyses of hormone-receptor, enzyme-substrate, receptor-    cell, DNA-DNA,
              DNA-protein, and protein-protein interactions.           These interactions are
              central to processes in molecular    and cellular biology such as cell
              motility, genetic    recombination, protein transport, RNA transcription, and  
               signal transduction. These interactions can now be studied in    real time
              over a wide dynamic range of size and    concentration, and without the need
              for radioisotopic, or    other, labeling.           Application   of   this 
              new  technology   will   greatly    facilitate fundamental research on cellular
              function and  will    contribute to the training of future biological
              scientists.
