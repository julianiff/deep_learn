Abstract    :
              9604561  Clark  This proposal is on research to examine two key issues  in the
              development of enzymes and other proteins from  thermophilic microorganisms
              which are to: (1) develop  processing methods to obtain significant quantities
              of  these enzymes for further investigation and potential  application, and (2)
              examine the mechanisms of  pressure-induced stabilization of proteins from
              extreme  thermophiles and devise approaches to manipulate the  thermostability
              of these enzymes.  Site-directed  mutagenesis is to be used in a systematic
              way, along  with biocatalytic studies at elevated pressures to  elucidate the
              effects of pressure on protein  thermostability and the interaction of subunits
              in  these multimeric enzymes.  ***
