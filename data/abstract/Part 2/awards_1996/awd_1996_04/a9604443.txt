Abstract    :
              9604443  DasSarma  This research tests the hypothesis that specific regions of
              the genome of Halobacterium halobium adopt supercoil density-dependent Z-DNA
              conformations that function as regulatory switches for the control of gene
              expression.  Halobacterium halobium is an extremely halophilic Archaea in which
              the left-handed Z-DNA conformation is favored by a highly negative DNA
              supercoiling density, a high G+C content including alternating CG sequences,
              and a high cytoplasmic salt concentration (5M).  A combination of mutagenic and
              biochemical analysis will determine if  expression of the bop gene encoding the
              H. halobium purple membrane protein is controlled by B-to-Z DNA
              conformation-dependent switch at a potential Z-DNA sequence located 23 base
              pairs upstream from the bop gene transcription start site.  Preliminary
              evidence indicates that bop gene transcription is induced under conditions of
              highly negative DNA supercoiling, and reduced when supercoiling is relieved by
              inhibition of DNA gyrase.  Therefore, the DNA gyrase inhibitor novobiocin will
              be used to determine the role of DNA supercoiling in mediating DNA
              conformational changes and bop transcription, including the development of an
              in vitro transcription system for studying the effects of DNA supercoiling on
              transcription.  %%%  This research will evaluate the role of DNA conformation
              and conditions that affect DNA conformation in the regulation of gene
              expression in Halobacterium halobium, a Archaea bacteria that exists under
              conditions of extremely high salt concentration.  ***
