Abstract    :
                The principal theoretical methodology proposed here is Brownian  dynamics
              (BD). The basic idea in Brownian dynamics simulations is  to model the
              complexation of two proteins undergoing relative  motion according to Brownian
              motion under the influence of  interprotein forces.  The forces are often
              electrostatic in  origin and continuum approaches such as the Poisson-Boltzmann
               (PB) method have been employed.  In most BD calculations, the  associating
              proteins have been described by simple models and  while this has yielded
              qualitatively correct results, it has been  difficult to predict absolute
              association rate constants.  Also,  only simple models of hydrodynamic
              interactions have been  considered.      We propose here to a) develop a
              detailed residue-level model for  substrate/target and b) incorporate more
              accurate hydrodynamic  effects into the method. It is increasingly recognized
              that  simulations would serve as a valuable companion to experimental 
              investigations and we want to establish the validity of Brownian  dynamics as a
              useful method for studying kinetics of  macromolecular association.
