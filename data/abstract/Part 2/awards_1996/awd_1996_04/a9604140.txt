Abstract    :
              9604140  Coughlin      Fish provide an elegant system for the study of muscle
              function.  Variations in the location and usage of the different muscle fiber
              types (slow, intermediate and fast) of fish permit evaluation of how each
              muscle type contributes to locomotion.  Rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss,
              show a number of interesting characteristics of muscle function during steady
              or sustained swimming (i.e. swimming that employs the slow, aerobic muscle
              fibers only).  Dr. Coughlin will explore how distinct patterns of body
              curvature and electrical activation in the muscle of swimming trout affect
              muscle function and locomotion.  Also, through comparison of the discrete life
              history stages observed in trout, such as the parr and smolt stages, the PI
              will examine how developmental changes in body shape and muscle kinetics effect
              swimming performance.  Lastly, through hormone manipulation, rainbow trout
              development will be manipulated to allow comparisons of swimming at the
              different life history stages with control for natural differences in size at
              each stage.  The study of fish swimming increases the understanding of muscle
              function in all vertebrates.  While this study will focus on aerobic muscle
              function in swimming fish, it has implications for our understanding of aerobic
              muscle function in other systems, especially other cyclically active muscle
              such as bird flight muscle and the power generating muscle of mammalian limbs.
