Abstract    :
              PI:  Furneaux  IBN-9604174  Furneaux   Brain cells respond to stimuli by rapidly
              changing the expression pattern of a small subset of genes.  Recently, it has
              become clear that the alteration of mRNA stability is an important contributor
              to this rapid response.  The mechanisms that regulate the stability of mRNA in
              brain cells are poorly understood.  Dr. Furneaux will investigate the factors
              that regulate the stability of GAP-43 mRNA.  GAP-43 is an important protein
              that is crucial for neuronal function.  Dr. Furneaux has previously cloned a
              family of neuronal specific RNA binding proteins (the Elav-like proteins) which
              specifically bind to GAP-43 mRNA.  In this project he will test the hypothesis
              that these proteins are the factors that regulate GAP-43 mRNA stability.  To do
              this he will use a biochemical approach.  A cell-free system has been
              established that can recapitulate the regulation of mRNA stability in vitro. 
              Dr. Furneaux will now directly test whether the addition of the Elav-like
              proteins will affect the stability of GAP-43 mRNA.  If the hypothesis is
              correct, the Elav-like proteins can be used to identify other components in
              this important signaling pathway.  In addition he will investigate the
              structure of the Elav-like protein/GAP-43 mRNA complex.  These studies will
              provide a more detailed picture of how the Elav-like proteins selectively bind
              to GAP-43 mRNA.
