Abstract    :
              9604599  Finlay    This U.S.-Brazil award will support collaborative research 
              between Dr. Barbara L. Finlay of Cornell University and Dr.  Luiz Carlos de
              Lima Silveira at the Universidade Federal do  Para, Centro de Ciencias
              Biologicas, to study the  development and evolution of the primate retina.   
              Drs. Finlay and De Lima Silveira will investigate the  development and
              evolution of the visual system, using New  World primates.  The developmental
              mechanisms that produce  the eye must use mechanisms, which are defined at a
              cellular  level, to solve functional problems, such as color  perception and
              night vision.  Finlay has expertise in the  developmental neurobiology of eye
              growth, and control of  neuron number and topography.  De Lima Silveira has 
              experience in comparative anatomy and physiology of the New  World primate
              retina, with particular attention to the  differences in eyes associated with
              color vision and  nocturnal and diurnal niches.  In addition to the benefit of 
              combining the unique resources of the two labs, access will  be gained to the
              National Research Center for Primates which  is located near Belem.  This
              facility has established  breeding colonies for all the monkeys needed for this
              study.  Facilities such as this one, with a such a diversity of  species, are
              not available in the United States.    ***
