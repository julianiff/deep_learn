Abstract    :
              9604250  Suki    This U.S.-Brazil award will support collaborative research 
              between Dr. Bela Suki of Boston University and Professor  Jose Andrade at
              Federal do Ceara, on the project entitled,  "Threshold Phenomena and Avalanches
              in Physiological Tree  Structures."          A curious phenomenon has been
              noted during procedures such  as heart surgery, where the clamping off of blood
              vessels  stops the blood flow to parts of the body other than the  part being
              operated on.  It was thought that the flow would  be diverted, taking another
              course.  This project will  address this problem.  Specifically, the PIs
              believe that  vessels and airways are parts of a tree structure and the  the
              opening and closing is influenced by the closing or  opening of other segments
              of the tree.  They describe this  as a highly discontinuous avalanche
              phenomenon.  The goal of  their project is to further the analytic procedures 
              necessary to solve this problem.  ***
