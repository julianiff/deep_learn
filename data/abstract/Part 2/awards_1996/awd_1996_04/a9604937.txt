Abstract    :
              Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans has  helped improve our
              understanding of the neuroanatomical  organization of behavior. Unfortunately,
              fMRI in animal  studies has not kept pace with human work. Experiments are 
              limited because animals must be anesthetized to prevent  motion artifacts,
              precluding most studies involving  neuroimaging of brain activity during
              behavior. Since the  level of arousal is inextricably linked to behavior, the
              use  of awake animals will produce a clearer understanding of the  neural
              circuitries underlying behavioral responses to  different sensory modalities
              like olfactory and visual  stimulation. This proposal will develop and test a
              new head  and body holder for performing fMRI in fully conscious  animals.
              Using this non-invasive method of imaging brain  activity, it will be possible
              to perform developmental fMRI  studies in animal models.
