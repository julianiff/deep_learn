Abstract    :
              9604408  Berridge    This project investigates how neural systems in the brain 
              control the sequential order of movements so as to produce  effective,
              coordinated action. The neural system targeted by  the project, the striatum,
              is known to control movement and  some aspects of natural behavior, and in
              humans it also  appears to help coordinate the sequence of words in language 
              and the sequence of thought patterns. The goal of this  project is to reveal
              the identity and characteristics of the  crucial neural circuits within the
              striatum that are most  involved in controlling sequential patterns of
              behavior, and  to understand how they provide normal coordination.  Experiments
              test the hypothesis that the sequencing circuit  uses the neurotransmitter
              dopamine to communicate between  neurons in the striatum in order to increase
              the strength of  particular natural sequential patterns of action in an 
              adaptive, goal-directed way. The project also examines how  the striatum uses
              modulation of sensory processing and  responsiveness to control sequential
              coordination of  movements. The results of the project improve the 
              understanding of how the brain coordinates normal behavior.  They may also
              provide insights into the processes that are  disturbed in human diseases that
              are characterized by  abnormal sequences of movement or thought (for example, 
              Huntington's Disease, Tourettes Syndrome, or obsessive-  compulsive disorder),
