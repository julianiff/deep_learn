Abstract    :
              Funds  are  requested  to purchase a Finnigan-MAT  LCQ  Ion  Trap  Mass 
              Spectrometer and  associated Hewlett Packard HPLC for use by a group of seven 
              independent, federally  funded investigators from three different basic science
              departments  (biochemistry,  pharmacology, and cell biology) at the Medical
              University of South  Carolina. It is  proposed to use this highly sensitive,
              efficient equipment in the  isolation, purification,  and synthesis of
              insulin-like proteins, retinal pigments and binding  proteins, GTP-binding 
              proteins, sperm motility proteins, lens globular proteins  (crystallins), and
              regA proteins.  The research projects of six additional users who will also
              benefit  from the proposed  instrument are also briefly described. Preliminary
              data using the LCQMS  instrument are  presented for a lens protein
              demonstrating that the LCQ technology  provides not only  state-of-the-art
              sensitivity, but saves enormous amounts of time and  sample handling  through
              its capability to perform on-line HPLC-MS and HPLC-MS/MS on one 
              chromatographic run.    The  proposed instrument will become a part of MUSC's
              Mass Spectrometry  Facility which has evolved into a laboratory primarily
              devoted  to  the  study  of protein structure and function. It combines
              research  in  new  developments and applications of mass spectrometry,
              application of this  technology  to important research problems by the faculty
              and  students  associated with the facility, and service to the general MUSC
              community  as well as to national and international collaborators.
