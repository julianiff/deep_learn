Abstract    :
              IBN 9604843  PI:  Reh      The development of the eye involves several different
              interactions to organize the neural network of the retina and the related
              non-neural pigment epithelium.  During early developmental stages, cells called
              blastomeres have the potential to later differentiate into progeny cells that
              can become a variety of different types.  Later, the type of cell which can
              arise from further cell divisions becomes more restricted.  Work on
              transplanted cells from various stages has shown that both intrinsic genetic
              factors and extrinsic factors in the developing environment apparently
              influence these cell fates to some degree.  This project uses the techniques of
              cell culture and molecular biology to examine the molecular factors that
              control eye development.  Specifically, the investigators will attempt to
              understand how extracellular secreted factors, like FGF and follistatin,
              control eye development through their regulation of critical eye determining
              transcription factors, like pax6.  The results will be important for
              understanding how cell interactions bring about the self-assembly of the
              developing nervous system.
