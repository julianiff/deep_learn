Abstract    :
              9604265  Place  Chitin is the second most abundant carbon biopolymer on earth,
              after cellulose, yet the full details of its metabolism in vertebrates are not
              well know.  The goals of our proposal are to elucidate the origin of endogenous
              chitin digestion in vertebrates, to develop a nonradioactive based method for
              measuring chitin assimilation applicable to other species including man, and to
              determine whether such assimilation contributes a significant cost or benefit
              to the vertebrate ingestor.  The investigation will first focus on a detailed
              biochemical characterization of the vertebrate enzymes involve in chitin
              breakdown (specifically in rainbow trout, Leach's Storm-petrel, a
              representative seabird, and the European Starling, a representative passerine).
               Each of these species have been shown to ingest natural prey high in chitin
              content and possess extensive gastric chitinolytic activity.  However, the
              ability to breakdown chitin does not match with chitin utilization, since
              digestibilities range from near zero in the trout to nearly 59% with Leach's
              Storm-petrel.  No evidence providing chitin assimilation efficiencies in
              vertebrates is currently available.  The data obtained will explain this
              apparent discrepancy between chitinolytic enzyme activity and assimilation and
              perhaps explain why man does not digest chitin very efficiently.
