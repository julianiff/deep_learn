	This proposal explains the need to replace the current
              high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems in the Center for
              Bioremediation and detoxification at The Pennsylvania State University.  A new
              HPLC system is required because the present systems are deteriorated and
              outdated.  They lack several important features that would allow various
              essential analyses.  We have selected the instruments available from Hewlett
              Packard (HP) and Isco.  Our decision was based on the versatility, reliability,
              and reputation of the companies (i.e. one-call service, high up-time, onsite
              installation, and demonstration of the features by qualified engineers).  We
              believe the instruments described below provide the maximum versatility and
              time-cost effectiveness available in a high-performance liquid chromatography
              system needed by our Center.
	The research at the laboratories of the Center
              is mostly concerned with the fate of environmentally important chemicals and
              bioremediation of contaminated sites.  The Center's interdisciplinary program
              integrates science with engineering through the research expertise of
              engineering, chemistry, biology, agronomy, plant pathology, geochemistry,
              mining engineering, ecology, and microbiology faculty.
