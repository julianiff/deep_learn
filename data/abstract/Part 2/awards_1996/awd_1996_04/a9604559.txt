Abstract    :
              9604559  Kairiss    This project examines the connections between two brain 
              regions that are known to be involved in memory functions,  the amygdala and
              perirhinal cortex. It is not known how  these areas interact during the storage
              and recall of  memories. The project addresses this question by examining  the
              details of how these areas are connected, how they  communicate with each
              other, and how one might modulate the  ability of the other to store
              information. It is believed  that memories are formed in the brain when the
              connections  between nerve cells change their effectiveness, thereby 
              increasing or decreasing the communication between them.  This project examines
              whether signals from the amygdala  control how memories are formed in the
              cortex by influencing  this process in the cortical nerve cells. Insights
              gained  from these studies advance the understanding of the  mechanisms by
              which different parts of the brain interact  during information processing and
              storage. Such insights are  fundamental to advancing our knowledge of how
              humans and  artificial intelligence systems learn new information, store  it,
              and recall it when needed.
