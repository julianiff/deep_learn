Abstract    :
              9604972  Richards  Technical   Mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana which have a
              decrease in DNA methylation (ddm) were isolated and characterized earlier. The
              ddml mutant has only about 30% of the wild type methylcytosine although it has
              wild type levels of methyl transferase. Moreover, it has been found that if
              these mutants are continuously selfed, progressive abnormalities appear. One
              such abnormality was reduced plant size and apical dominance (ball). The ball
              mutation, which is stable, has been mapped to a genome site different than the
              ddml mutation. During the tenure of this project, the DDMl gene will be
              isolated and characterized. Additionally, the BAL locus will be isolated by a
              map-based cloning approach and characterized at a molecular level. The
              phenotypic, genetic, biochemical and molecular analysis of ddm2 mutants will
              also continue.    Non-technical  It has been observed that there are described
              genetic phenomena which cannot be explained by Mendelian genetics and
              suggestive evidence implicates DNA methylation. It has been difficult to
              document cause and effect but the information resulting from this work should
              provide greater insiqht into basic qenetic mechanisms.
