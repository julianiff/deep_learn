Abstract    :
                 Chemosensory receptor cells detect molecules and ions in the environment as  
              a signal different from the background.  There are two fundamental problems 
              olfactory systems face.  First, when the environment changes rapidly, how does 
              the chemosensory system avoid breakdown in its detecting capability?  Second,
              how do olfactory membranes that detect these chemicals function over time when
              the membranes themselves are constantly renewed? This project uses the antennae
              of an intertidal crab as a novel model system to investigate both of these
              important questions, using  a combination of physiological and microscopic
              techniques.  Experiments are designed to determine how ion levels are regulated
              in the fluid bathing the chemosensory membranes to maintain suitable conditions
              for olfactory function.  Morphological studies will define how these membranes
              react by growth or regeneration to the challenge of exposure to very different
              salinities.  The environmental change can range between seawater and freshwater
              in the tidal estuaries in which these crabs live, and this study helps to
              understand how the chemosensory system can adapt to those rapid changes.   
              Results will be important beyond chemosensory neuroscience alone, for 
              understanding the maintenance of sensory membranes in general, for cell biology
              by understanding membrane turnover and regeneration, and for ecology by
              understanding some of the biological mechanisms useful for animals to adapt to
              rapid environmental change.
