Abstract    :
              9604854  Andres    This U.S.-Mexico award will provide support for Dr. Robert 
              J. Andres, University of Alaska, to travel to Mexico to plan  a research
              collaboration with Drs. Hugo Delgado Granados and  Ignacio Galindo at the
              Universidad Nacional Autonoma de  Mexico and Universidad de Colima
              respectively, on the  improvement of volcanic emissions measurement.  During
              this  visit, Dr. Andrade will update his Mexican colleagues on  final results
              of lab experiments, work to enhance Mexico's  on-going correlation spectrometer
              monitoring efforts, and  conclude planning on a collaborative research
              proposal.    In order for this project to proceed, Dr. Andrade needs to  meet
              face-to-face with his colleagues and to visit the  volcanoes being considered
              for study.  There are two active  volcanoes in Mexico, Popocatepetl and Colima.
               In addition,  this visit is being scheduled to coincide with the PIs 
              attendance at the International Association of Volcanology  and Chemistry of
              the Earth's Interior.  It is hoped that  during this meeting the PIs will be
              able to identify others  who can be added to this collaboration, who have
              similar or  supportive interests.    ***
