Abstract    :
              9604629  Comer    Most movements are oriented toward or away from specific 
              objects in the environment. This project investigates how  cells in the nervous
              system transform sensory signals  entering the brain into coded commands that
              direct an  organism's goal directed movements.  The project  accomplishes this
              by mapping the neural circuits connecting  sensory systems to the command
              neurons controlling limb  movement, by recording the responses of these command
               neurons to different types of sensory stimulation, and by  selectively
              stimulating or blocking the activity of command  neurons in the circuitry
              controlling movement. The results  of these experiments provide information
              important to  understanding how the nervous system controls goal-directed 
              movement and should also implications for the design of  robotic controllers
              and human prosthetic devices.
