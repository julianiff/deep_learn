Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to provide powerful, state-  of-the-art
              instrumentation for the production of genetically  altered mice.  This
              specialized equipment will provide  investigators with the ability to go from a
              cloned DNA  molecule to genetically altered mice.  These animals allow  the
              biological study of gene function in developmental and  physiological processes
              in the whole organism.  This  instrumentation will enable the University of
              Michigan  Transgenic Animal Core to meet the research demands of a  growing
              number of investigators.  Demand for transgenic  technology is constantly
              increasing due to the excellent  success rate of the Core and the power of this
              technology to  enhance basic science knowledge.
