Abstract    :
              OKAMURO  9604507    Arabidopsis flower development is governed by an
              evolutionarily conserved network of genes that control the establishment and
              maintenance of flower meristem identity, floral organ development, and
              gametogenesis. However, little is known about how these genes function together
              at the cell and molecular levels. The APETALA2 (AP2) gene plays a central role
              in controlling flower development in Arabidopsis, in part, by controlling the
              temporal and spatial expression pattern of another floral homeotic gene AGAMOUS
              (AG). The AP2 protein represents the first of what is now known to be an
              important new family of plant DNA binding proteins including EREBPs,
              AINTEGUMENTA, and TINY. The goal of the experiments in this project is to
              understand how AP2 controls AG gene expression at the molecular level by
              analyzing its DNA binding activity in vitro and to identify proteins that may
              physically interact with and function together with AP2 during flower
              development. Specific goals include: (1) identifying sequences within the AP2
              polypeptide that are required for AP2 DNA binding activity in vitro, (2)
              identifying sequences within the AP2 polypeptide that are required for AP2
              function in viva, (3) determining how AP2 gene activity is regulated at the
              posttranslational level, (4) determining whether AP2 forms multimers with
              itself or with other AP2 domain containing proteins in viva, and (5)
              identifying proteins that form stable physical interactions with AP2 using gel
              filtration chromatography. The elucidation of AP2 function will ultimately
              provide new insight into the control of plant growth and development at the
              molecular level.
