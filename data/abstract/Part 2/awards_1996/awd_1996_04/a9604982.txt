Abstract    :
              9604982  Cobb    This one-year planning project will focus on the teaching of
              statistics at the middle-school level (grades seven and eight). The
              investigators will develop and assess an instructional  sequence that uses a
              customized mini-tool programmed in Java. This sequence will emphasize students'
              exploratory data analysis within the context of large-scale real world
              applications in statistics. The tool and instructional sequence will be
              designed, then field-tested via a twelve-week teaching experiment in a seventh
              grade classroom.
