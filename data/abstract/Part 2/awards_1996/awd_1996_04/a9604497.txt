Abstract    :
              9604497  Smith  The ecophysiological effects of multiple stress factors have
              been recognized as an important omission in studies of plant adaptation to the
              environment and effects on abundance and distribution patterns.  Cold
              temperatures, in combination with high sunlight levels, is a particularly
              important combination of stress factors that results in severe inhibition of
              photosynthesis in numerous agricultural and the few native species that have
              been studied.  This project will investigate the adaptive responses of native
              alpine/subalpine plants to one of the most extreme, naturally-occurring
              combinations of low temperature and high sunlight found in any habitat.  By
              evaluating plant responses to this extreme stress combination, we hope to
              establish an estimate of the maximum adaptive capabilities to this
              multiple-stress scenario that currently exists among terrestial vascular
              plants.  The study will focus on photosynthetic responses that we believe are
              critical to plant survival under these extreme multiple-stress conditions.  In
              addition, the impact of future changes in global climate on cold temperature
              photoinhibition will be evaluated using two atmospheric parameters which are
              known measures of global atmospheric change, atmospheric warming and increases
              in UV radiation.  The results will be evaluated on a leaf, whole-plant, and
              landscape level.
