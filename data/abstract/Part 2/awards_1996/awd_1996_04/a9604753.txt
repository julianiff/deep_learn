Abstract    :
              This application requests funds for the acquisition of  biophysical
              instrumentation for molecular recognition  studies.  The instrument is an
              isothermal titration  calorimeter (MicroCal).  Isothermal titration calorimetry
               directly measures the thermodynamics of protein-ligand  interaction.  The
              systems currently under study are: protein-  protein interactions in
              ferredoxin-linked chloroplast  enzymes; cAMP receptor protein (CRP) interacting
              with cAMP  and double stranded DNA; cold shock protein interacting with  the
              specific single-stranded DNA sequences; interactions of  sterol and sterol
              derivatives with (S)-adenosyl-L-  methionine;24(25)-sterol methyl transferase
              (SMT);  interactions of metallo--lactamases with -lactam  antibiotics.  Direct
              determination of the thermodynamics of  binding in these systems,
              characterization of conformational  changes upon binding, and their analysis
              will complement and  extend previous biochemical results.
