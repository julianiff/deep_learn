Abstract    :
              EPCC's research projects which will utilize the proposed  instrumentation
              include: (1) A study of the environmental  factors that affect virus survival
              in groundwater and  surface water and the structural changes associated with 
              viral inactivation and reactivation.  (2) Taxonomic studies  of rattlesnakes in
              the southwest by comparing  chromatographic profiles of snake venoms.  (3)
              Isolation and  characterization of microorganisms indigenous to the  intertidal
              zone and to the EI Paso, TX area.  (4) The use of  bacteria and peat moss in
              the design of electrodes specific  for heavy metals.  (5) A study of Giardia
              Lamblia surface  antigens will require the use of the SMART system and liquid 
              scintillation system to purify and analyze the radioactively-  labeled
              proteins.
