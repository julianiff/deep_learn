Abstract    :
              Johnson  9604527    This project is concerned with synthesis of inositol in
              plants.  While much is known about inositol phosphate signaling in animals, the
              corresponding issues in plants have not been well studied.  The overall
              long-term goal of the work is to understand inositol's role in the biology of
              subcellular organelles.  The PI has shown, in previous studies, that the key
              biosynthetic enzyme, myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase, has temporally and
              spatially controlled isoforms which is novel and unexpected.  This particular
              project will involve a detailed study of the sites of inositol and
              phosphoinositol synthesis.  A combination of immunocytochemical analyses, in
              situ hybridization studies, and enzyme activity measurements will be performed
              using Phaseolus vulgaris as a model.  This work will help in developing an
              understanding of cell signaling in plants, as well as regulation of an
              important metabolic pathway.     This project is concerned with synthesis of
              inositol in plants.  While much is known about inositol phosphate signaling in
              cells of animals, the corresponding issues in plants have not been well
              studied.  This particular project will involve a detailed study of the sites of
              inositol and phosphoinositol synthesis in bean plants.  The results will
              provide important information about processes which control plant growth,
              development, and differentiation.
