Abstract    :
              9604975  Bruno    This Americas Program award will provide support for U.S. 
              participation in "The Fifth International Conference on  Coastal Ocean Space
              Utilization" to be held in Argentina.  The coordinators on the U.S. side are
              Drs. Michael S. Bruno  and Robert B. Abel of Stevens Institute of Technology,
              and  Dr. Charles Ehler of NOAA.  For the Argentine side, the  coordinators are
              Dr. Ascensio Lara, Mr. Alberto Lonardi, and  RADM Alfredo Jung (Argentinian
              Navy).  This conference will  bring together leading ocean experts from
              science,  technology, industry, and government to consider questions  of how to
              effectively use ocean space.  The basic theme of  this meeting is that the
              world is using up all the available  space on land and needs to now consider
              how we can make use  of the ocean.  This particular component of the Symposium 
              series is especially significant because it represents the  first such forum
              for Latin American scientists and engineers  to meet their North American and
              other colleagues on matters  of special concern in South and Central America.
