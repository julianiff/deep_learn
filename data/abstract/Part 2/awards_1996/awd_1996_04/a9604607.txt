Abstract    :
                     Temperature stress poses a unique and escalating  problem to plants since
              they are immobile captives of the  environment. Plants, like all other
              organisms, respond to  increasing temperature by the specific expression of
              heat  shock proteins. These proteins are essential for the plant  to mount a
              tolerance response to many stresses including  higher temperatures.  However
              the specific functions of  these proteins in stress tolerance is largely
              unknown.  Preliminary experiments have demonstrated a role for one  specific
              and prominent heat shock protein, Hsp17.7, in  thermotolerance, by using
              antisense technology to decrease  the expression of this protein.  The proposed
              experiments  will investigate why the plants expressing an antisense  version
              of Hspl7.7 mRNA are less thermotolerant and should  provide insight into the
              overall process of plant  thermotolerance.       Antisense Hspl7.7 plants show
              dramatic decreases in the  levels of Hspl7.7 as well as other non-related Hsps.
               The  underlying molecular mechanisms by which this occurs will be  addressed
              by quantitative analysis of mRNA and protein  levels using gene specific probes
              and specific antibodies.  The analysis will focus on the processes of
              transcription,  translation and protein processing and turnover in  transgenic
              and control cells. In addition, the potential  chaperone function of Hsp17.7
              will be assessed using  standard assays.
