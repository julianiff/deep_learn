Abstract    :
              9604115  Giovannoni  Dr. Giovannoni treats ripening of the tomato fruit as a
              developmental program - in contrast to most of other analyses in which the
              tomato fruit is studied as an example of plant senescence.  Some
              ethylene-insensitive tomato mutants, indeed, indicate that the
              senescence-specific hormone ethylene can be modulated in a developmental
              fashion.  His group has isolated from tomato genes homologous to components of
              the ethylene signal transduction pathway detected in other plants.  In
              combination with his mutant collection and the detection of fruit-specific
              transcripts that do not respond to ethylene but are under other developmental
              control, the project develops.    It includes the characterization and
              transgenic manipulation of the CTR1 ethylene signal transduction modulator as
              one aspect.  Secondly, constitutive ethylene responding mutants are
              characterized physiologically and with respect to the expression of
              developmentally-regulated transcripts.  Finally, non-ethylene responsive,
              developmentally induced transcripts will be functionally characterized.  The
              work is expected to provide an integrative view of different gene expression
              programs regulating fruit ripening in general.
