Abstract    :
                                                        Funds are requested to purchase a
              Leica TCS NT confocal microscope  system to  establish a multiple user confocal
              facility. This system best fits the  needs of the user group  and the diverse
              projects and approaches proposed here. The user group  represents a cross 
              section of the Salk faculty and departmental representation. The11  listed
              users of the  requested confocal system include faculty representatives of 5 
              departments of the Salk  Institute. The 7 major users include faculty
              representatives of 4  departments, and the 4 minor  users listed include
              faculty representatives of 3 departments.        The research projects
              contained within this proposal emphasize  cellular and molecular approaches to
              study a broad range of issues in  experimental biology, including chromosome
              replication and segregation,  regulators of DNA replication, the trafficking of
              macromolecules from  the nucleus to the cytoplasm, localization of
              neurotransmitter  receptors and ion channel in the brain, and fundamental
              events in  neural development such as neural induction, cell fate and 
              differentiation, neuronal migration and axon guidance, and the  development of
              neural circuits.
