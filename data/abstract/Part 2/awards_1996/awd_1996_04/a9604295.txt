Abstract    :
              9604295  Hyman  Eukaryotic mRNA 3'-end formation occurs by a complex mechanism
              involving pre-mRNA cleavage and subsequent enzymatic addition of multiple
              adenosine residues to create a poly(A) tail.  Mutations in RNA sequences that
              direct polyadenylation also result in defects in termination of transcription
              suggesting that these two processes may be coupled in an as yet undetermined
              mechanism.  Termination of transcription by RNA polymerase II is most likely a
              complex process involving one or more accessory factors.  This research is
              aimed at understanding how the mechanisms of mRNA polyadenylation and
              transcription termination converge to form a functional mRNA 3'-end.  A yeast
              model system will take advantage of combined molecular genetic and biochemical
              approaches to identify trans-acting factors and corresponding genes required
              for mRNA 3'-end formation and determine their function.    The synthesis of a
              functional eukaryotic messenger RNA requires the formation of a mature mRNA
              3'-end, which occurs by a complex mechanism.  Mutations in RNA sequences that
              direct 3'-end formation also result in defects in the termination of
              transcription suggesting that the two processes may be coupled in an as yet
              undetermined mechanism. This research is aimed at understanding the mechanistic
              relationship between mRNA 3'-end formation and transcription termination in a
              yeast model system.
