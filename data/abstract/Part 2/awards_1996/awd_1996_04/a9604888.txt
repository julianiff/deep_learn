Abstract    :
              Floss  9604888    This award supports a three-year collaborative research 
              project between Dr. Heinz Floss of the University of  Washington and Dr. Yu Sam
              Kim of Yonsei University in Seoul,  Korea on "Stereochemical Studies of
              Malonate Metabolism."  The goals of the project are 1) to determine the 
              stereochemical course of malonate decarboxylation by the  malonate
              decarboxylases from selected species and 2) to  determine the
              stereospecificities, if any, of methylmalonate  activation.    Dr. Kim's 
              research group in Korea has a long-standing  interest in the metabolism and
              physiological role of  malonate and its derivatives in plants and
              microorganisms  and has done extensive research on this subject.  Dr. Heinz' 
              research group has extensive experience in the  stereochemical analysis of
              enzyme-catalyzed reactions and  has developed methods for the analysis of
              reactions  involving malonate as substrate.  This project will bring  these
              research groups together to study the steric course of  a number of enzyme
              reactions involving transformations of  malonate or its derivatives.  The study
              should lead to  improved understanding of enzyme reaction mechanisms.  ***
