Abstract    :
                A   major  users  group  from  the  Biochemistry  Department  at  the 
              University of Missouri-Columbia (MU) is  requesting a Beckman XL-I analytical
              ultracentrifuge. In contrast to  its predecessor (the Model E), the XL-I  is
              well-suited for sedimentation analyses by specialists and  non-specialists
              alike. All facets of instrument  operation are under computer control.
              User-friendly software is used to  configure sedimentation conditions  and
              data-acquisition parameters and to perform subsequent data  analysis. The XL-I
              is supplied with both  interference and absor-bance detection systems for
              maximum flexibility  in experimental design. The  instrument would find
              application in a variety of contemporary  biological research problems.
