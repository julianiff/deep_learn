Abstract    :
                        INT-9604831  Landau    This U.S.-Bulgarian Cooperative Research award
              is on "Computer Simulations of Polydisperse Polymer Systems."  The principal
              researchers are Dr. David P. Landau of the University of Georgia, and Dr.
              Andrey I. Milchev of the Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Bulgarian
              Academy of Sciences.  The researchers will combine their expertise to perform
              large scale Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the static and dynamic
              behavior of polydisperse systems of a broad class of "soft" condensed matter
              systems generally known as "living polymers."  They will place particular
              emphasis on understanding the behavior of model systems in confined geometries
              and under conditions of shear flow.    This research in applied condensed
              matter physics fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading
              experts in the U.S. and Bulgaria to combine complementary efforts and
              capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of
              equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.    ***  ??
