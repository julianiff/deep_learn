Abstract    :
              ***  9604872  Thumm  The scattering of positive atomic ions from metal surfaces 
              is studied theoretically using a novel technique, Weyl  wavepackets, to include
              the effect of the continuum levels  on the transition probabilities. 
              Applications of the  methodology to chemisorption and catalysis will be 
              investigated.  ***
