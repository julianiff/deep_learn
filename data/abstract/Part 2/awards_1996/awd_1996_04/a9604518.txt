Abstract    :
              9604518  Bowes  Dr. Bowes has worked on the mechanisms of carbon fixation during
              photosynthesis for many years.  His work has recently moved into a new area,
              and the laboratory is now using molecular analysis of gene expression in
              addition to biochemical analyses.  Adding to the three basic types of carbon
              fixation mechanisms, Dr. Bowes now adds another one.  His group detected plants
              which show inducible aspects of C4 metabolism without expressing the
              morphological/anatomical characteristics of this pathway.    The work proposed
              promises to provide an integration of molecular, evolutionary and physiological
              aspects of the new pathway.  The group will isolate the transcripts for key
              enzymes of the pathway, place them into an evolutionary context and study the
              biochemical characteristics of these enzymes.  The focus is on the differences
              in activity regulation that can be expected to distinguish the enzymes that are
              expressed when the plants are in different fixation modes.
