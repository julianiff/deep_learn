Abstract    :
              9604670  PADEN    The pituitary is often called the master gland of the body 
              because hormones that it releases control the function of  other glands.  One
              of these hormones is adrenocorticotrophic  hormone (ACTH), which stimulates
              production of cortisol and  other steroid hormones by the adrenal gland.  ACTH
              release  is in turn controlled by the brain, which stimulates the  pituitary to
              release ACTH in times of stress or injury.  Thus understanding the mechanisms
              by which the brain  controls ACTH release is essential for understanding how 
              stress affects the body.  It has been known for many years  that the brain
              stimulates ACTH release in part by releasing  hormones itself, but it has been
              unclear if other control  mechanisms also exist.  Dr. Paden and others have
              recently  discovered that nerve fibers of unknown origin enter the  pituitary
              gland and appear to contact the cells that make  ACTH (called corticotrophs). 
              His current studies will  determine where these nerves come from and what type
              of  chemical signals they may employ to affect the activity of  corticotrophs. 
              Other experiments will investigate whether  or not these nerves respond to
              stress.  Results from these  studies may demonstrate the existence of an
              additional  pathway by which the brain can control ACTH release,  providing new
              insights into the mechanisms of the stress  response.
