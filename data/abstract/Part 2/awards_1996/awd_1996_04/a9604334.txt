Abstract    :
              Kent  9604334         Steroid hormones are known to exert profound 
              developmental and behavioral effects on organisms ranging  from insects to
              humans. One way that steroids exert these  effects is by influencing the shape
              and structure of  specific neurons in the central nervous system.  The shape 
              of each neuron will determine, in part, the numbers and  types of connections
              it makes with other neurons and these  connections, in turn, will dictate or
              influence behavior.  As a result of  development, aging, injury, or disease, 
              neuronal connections may be altered and an individual's  behavior changed.  
              Although steroid hormones have been  implicated in playing a role in these
              processes,  the  mechanisms by which steroids  influence individual neurons 
              and their connections is still poorly understood.   Dr.  Kent's  research is
              directed towards understanding  how a  steroid hormone can influence the shape
              of an neuron.   By  using individual steroid-sensitive neurons from a simple 
              model insect system, she will define the conditions under  which steroid
              hormones exert their effects on neuronal shape  and size and then identify
              cellular and molecular mechanisms  underlying these steroid induced changes. 
              Information  gained in the course of these studies will contribute to a 
              growing understanding of steroid action on the nervous  system and ultimately
              to the development of strategies  ranging from the control of insect pests to
              the treatment of  birth defects, age-related diseases, neurological damage, 
              and psychiatric disorders.
