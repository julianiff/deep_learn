Abstract    :
                9604916  Xu and Michelli    This award supports travel costs for a group of 
              U.S.  researchers in computational mathematics to meet with  Chinese
              researchers. The workshop will be held August 1997  at Zhongshan University in
              Guangzhou, China, and is intended  to provide a forum to identify common
              priorities in  computational mathematics and to provide a basis for 
              development of collaborative research. China is increasingly  emphasizing
              computational mathematics, and while U.S.  researchers are familiar with the
              work of Chinese  researchers located outside China, there is little known 
              about what is happening inside China in this field.    This workshop is
              intended to introduce U.S. researchers to  developments in the field of
              computational mathematics in  China, and to define possible areas of future
              cooperation.  Technical topics to be highlighted at the workshop include  some
              of the most active fields in scientific computation.
