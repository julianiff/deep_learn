Abstract    :
                   The retina of the eye in many mammals has what is known as a 'duplex'  
              property, with photoreceptor cells for color vision, called cones, as well as  
              photoreceptor cells for night vision called rods.  The cones only work in
              fairly   bright light, while the rods work well in dim light.  These
              photoreceptor cells send   information via an intermediate group of retinal
              cells, called bipolar cells, then   the signal passes eventually to the retinal
              ganglion cells, which are the neurons   that give rise to the optic nerve to
              the brain.  It is thought that there are two   distinct pathways for the signal
              of light intensity from the rods to be transmitted   within the retina to the
              ganglion cells.  In one pathway the rod signal travels   directly to rod
              bipolar cells; in the other pathway the rod signal is believed to   cross a
              junction between rods and cones, then enters the cone pathway.  This   project
              uses a unique approach combining physiological recording of retinal   activity
              with specific pharmacological blockers of certain kinds of   neurotransmitters
              to isolate the contribution of these two pathways to vision. The   results will
              further our understanding of the complex visual processing that   occurs in the
              retina.     Results will be important not only to retinal physiology, but to
              understanding   visual perception and perhaps to artificial vision devices.
