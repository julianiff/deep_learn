Abstract    :
              9604528  Stewart  The proposed research will develop green fluorescent protein
              (GFP) as a whole-plant fluorescent marker for use in subsequent physiological
              and ecological research.  GFP when engineered into plants cause the plants glow
              green in the presence of an ultraviolet or blue light, thereby enabling them to
              be distinguished from wild-type pink plants.  This system would allow
              researchers to detect GFP-genetically engineered plants very easily in vivo and
              in real time in a mixed population containing non-GFP plants.  Also plant
              responses to biological or environmental stimuli could also be studied using
              such an in vivo marker.    The PI (Nature Biotechnology 14:682, 1996) has
              demonstrated the feasibility of using GFP technology for ecological work. 
              However, many of the details controlling expression and fluorescence of GFP in
              whole plant applications are unknown.  Some of the unknown factors revolve
              around the following questions:  Which GFP gene is most useful in whole plant
              studies?  What is the threshold expression/fluorescent level necessary for
              visual observation:  What are the environmental controls of expression and
              fluorescence?  How stable is GFP in plant cells, and what is the response time
              for induced expression?  Are there any fitness costs associated with high
              expression and fluorescence in GFP transgenics?  What are fluorescence patterns
              in the field?  Experiments are proposed that will directly answer all these
              questions in 2 years.  These questions must be answered before this powerful
              technology may be used effectively in physiological ecology research.
