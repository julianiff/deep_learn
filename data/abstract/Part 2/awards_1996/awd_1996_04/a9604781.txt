Abstract    :
                  A  user group consisting of twenty principal investigators  and their
              research staff at  Boston Biomedical Research Institute, is requesting a MALDI-
               TOF mass spectrometer,  the Voyager Elite BioSpectrometry Research Station
              from  PerSeptive Biosystems.  These  investigators are conducting a diversity
              of research  projects such as the investigation of  protein-protein interaction
              and structure-function  relationships of various proteins in both  striated and
              smooth muscle and the role of Ca++-binding  proteins in muscle contraction, 
              the study of submit interactions in membrane associated  energy transducing and
              transport  systems, the design of immunotoxins and nativiral agents,  the
              elucidation of catalytic  mechanisms in enzymes, and the control of gene
              expression.
