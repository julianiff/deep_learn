Abstract    :
                       Mechanistic and kinetic studies of enzymes involved  in the metabolism
              of aromatic hydrocarbons, degradation of  alkylamines, and respiration will be
              undertaken. The enzymes  include the flavocytochrome p-cresol methylhydroxylase
               (Pseudomonas putida), the quinoprotein methylamine  dehydrogenase
              (methylotrophic bacteria), copper-containing  quinoprotein amine oxidases
              (human and Arthrobacter  globoformis), and iron-sulfur flavoproteins succinate 
              dehydrogenase (mammalian and bacteria) and fumarate  reductase from Escherichia
              coli. The numbers, types, and  redox potentials of the organic and metal ion
              cofactors are  already defined.           The majority of these enzymes have
              been cloned to  allow for alteration of their properties by genetic 
              manipulation. The available x-ray structures of many of the  proteins studied
              will guide some of the research. It is  proposed that the requested
              rapid-scanning stopped-flow  spectrophotometer be used to define events
              occurring on  substrate/ligand binding to enzymes, and the properties of  the
              individual cofactors in integrated functions. It is also  proposed that the
              instrument be used as a rapid-recording,  dual-wavelength spectrophotometer for
              essential quinol  oxidation reduction assays.
