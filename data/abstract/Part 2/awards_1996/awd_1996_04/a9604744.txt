Abstract    :
                   The  goal of this proposal is to provide partial  funding for a  second
              X-ray area detector for use in the  Molecular Biophysics Department  of the
              Hauptman-Woodward  Medical Research  Institute, and  for the refurbishing and 
              modification of the existing  image plate  detector Rigaku R-  AXIS IIc. The
              requested  funds  will  be used  to purchase a  Rigaku RUH3R rotating anode
              generator, a four module  charge-  coupled  device (CCD) detector  system  from
               Area Detector  System Corporation, focusing mirrors, K  goniostat  and low 
              temperature  device,  and  a  dedicated  Silicon   Graphics  workstation.  The
              presence of a second detector will  permit  the modification of the existing
              R-AXIS IIc, which is  equipped with a graphite monochromator, to enable routine
               target changes.
