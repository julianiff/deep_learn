Abstract    :
              9604950  Fergus    This award supports initiation of collaborative research in 
              materials science between Jeffrey Fergus, Auburn University,  and Wang Yinbang,
              Beijing University of Science and  Technology.  The research involves
              evaluation of the  potential of several lanthanide fluorides in thin-film low- 
              temperature oxygen sensors.  Oxygen sensors are used in  industrial processing
              and control applications; improved  understanding of the mechanisms of
              lanthanum fluoride  sensors will be of significant value to the electrochemical
               community.    The project will make use of complementary facilities and 
              expertise at the two universities.  Auburn University will  provide expertise
              in development and testing of chemical  sensors, and will perform the
              electrochemical  characterization of the sensor performance.  Beijing 
              University of Science and Technology will provide the thin-  film fabrication
              and surface characterization expertise.
