Abstract    :
              The investigators will use data from ground-based radio-wave and optical
              instruments at the Bear Lake Observatory near Logan, Utah, to address two
              problems in atmospheric sciences.  The first is a study stratospheric warming
              events.  Measurements of winds, kinetic and rotational temperatures, and
              emission intensities made with Fabry-Perot and Michelson interferometers will
              be used to study mid-latitude effects from wintertime stratospheric warming
              events.  These effects are evidence for dynamic coupling between low and high
              latitudes.  The second task is to study gravity wave coupling between the
              neutral atmosphere and ionosphere.  This study will combine observations of
              mesospheric nightglow emissions made by the all-sky imager with electron
              density measurements made by the digital ionosonde.  The results will show if
              there is a relationship between mesospheric wave activity and the state of the
              ionosphere.  The project also includes the installation of a telephone line
              extender to increase the  phone/modem remote access to observatory instruments.
