Abstract    :
                The investigators will develop an Arctic Ocean circulation model coupled to a
              sea ice model on two spatial grids. The model numerical will allow the
              researchers to investigate the input of Pacific Ocean water and the outflow of
              Arctic Ocean water to the Atlantic so that not only the circulation within the
              Arctic Ocean is simulated but also the important inputs and outputs are
              derived. The model should produce a very realistic circulation that may be
              examined for changing climatic conditions to determine the climatic effect on
              both Arctic Ocean circulation and the effects of that circulation on the North
              Atlantic Ocean. The model will provide a framework for other studies in the
              Arctic that require a predictive capability for ocean circulation in areas of
              the Arctic ocean where no observational data exists.
