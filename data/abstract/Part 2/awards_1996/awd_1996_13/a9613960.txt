Abstract    :
              The  Grouplens research project explores collaborative  filtering  approaches to
              address information overload for users of  Internet  information  systems. 
              Collaborative filtering  is  a  technology  that  uses the opinions of some
              readers of a document to  predict  the  interest of other potential readers in
              that document.   This  project   builds  upon  the  successful  Grouplens 
              collaborative  filtering  system for Usenet news to explore in more  detail 
              the  human  factors and algorithmic issues of collaborative filtering.  This  
              project   addresses   three   fundamental   problems    in  collaborative
              filtering: how to effectively measure user interest  with  minimal  effort from
              users, how to use  these  measures  of  interest   to  produce  accurate 
              predictions  of  other   user's  interest,   and   how   to   integrate  
              non-collaborative    and  collaborative  filtering  approaches to create 
              robust  filtering  environments.    The   research  approach   relies   upon  
              three  experimental methods.  A set of controlled experimental trials is  used
              to gather complete ratings datasets to directly measure  the  effectiveness  of
              collaborative filtering algorithms.   A  small-  scale public trial is used to
              collect data on the actual usage of  the  GroupLens  system.  Survey research
              is used to  obtain  user  opinions and feedback from both trials.
