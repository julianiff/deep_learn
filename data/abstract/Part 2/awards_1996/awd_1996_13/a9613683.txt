Abstract    :
                 Abstract  9613683  Arnoldy  This project operates and analyzes the data from
              an array of induction coil magnetometers located at high geomagnetic latitudes
              in the Arctic and Antarctic.  The Sites are Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland and 
              Iqaluit, NWT, Canada in the Arctic and South Pole and McMurdo in the Antarctic.
               They also complement similar magnetometers in the US and British Automatic
              Geophysical Observatory (AGO) networks and the MACCS array in Canada.  The
              measurements of magnetic pulsations at these high geomagnetic latitudes are
              used to study the plasma physics of some the important boundaries of the
              magnetosphere, particularly those surrounding the area through which the solar
              wind enters the magnetosphere and where the magnetosphere transfers the solar
              wind's energy to the Earth's atmosphere in the form of aurora and similar
              phenomena.  This project is jointly supported by the US Arctic and Antarctic
              Programs.
