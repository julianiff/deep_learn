Abstract    :
              9613562  Braden  The project responded to the NSF/EPA solicitation for 
              proposals for research on the topic of Water and Watersheds.  The work will
              study the renewal of large floodplain river  ecosystems which are found in many
              areas of the United  States especially in the Midwestern States.  The project 
              will focus on the conditions of the Upper Mississippi River  Basin, using a
              section of the Illinois River as the study  site.  This river is one of the
              only three large floodplain  river systems that retain an appreciable annual
              flood pulse.  The river also has a high ecological potential which has  been
              diminished by water management practices.  A model that  will integrate the
              river hydrology, ecology and economy will  be developed for the simulation of
              the interactions of flood  plain and river uses, such as agriculture,
              navigation,  recreation, commercial fishing and forestry, with species 
              carrying capacity.  The model will have a policy component  that will examine
              the significance of these uses and water  management on systems outcomes.  The
              results from this  research will improve the management of the watershed 
              resources and the organizations responsible for it, and the  experience will be
              transferable to other large floodplain  river systems.  ***
