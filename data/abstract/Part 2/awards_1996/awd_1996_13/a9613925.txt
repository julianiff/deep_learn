Abstract    :
              The PIs intend to test their prediction abilities on a given day the location
              and timing of ionospheric irregularities in the high latitude F region.  Much
              of the high latitude F-region weather is cause by small scale (irregularities)
              and large scale (polar cap patches, polar cap arcs, boundary blobs, subauroral
              blobs, auroral blobs, auroral ionospheric cavities) electron density
              structures.  There is an intimate cause and effect relationship between these
              small and large scale irregularities.  The PIs will use the Global Theoretical
              Ionospheric Model (GTIM) to determine the requirements for accurately
              forecasting patches and blobs, and, in turn, using expressions for instability
              growth rates, forecast the appearance of electron density irregularities.  In
              sum, this three-year project will:  (1) test current understanding of large
              scale F-region structures and their ability to produce small scale
              irregularities, (2) confirm the role of two instability processes in generating
              small scale irregularities, (3) test current capability to specify and forecast
              conditions in the high latitudes that impact satellite communications, (4) help
              establish what processes need to be included in any physics-based ionospheric
              weather model, and (5) establish the level of detail required in the
              high-latitude electric field in order to specify and forecast ionospheric
              weather.
