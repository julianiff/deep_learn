Abstract    :
              ***  9613405  Lave        This grant provides funding for the development and
              testing of a cost accounting system that identifies the full social cost
              impacts of the energy consumption and environmental consequences of each raw
              material, process and product internal and external to the firm.  These
              management information tools will be developed in cooperation with three major
              corporations and will permit the internalization of a large portion of the
              energy consumption and environmental impact externalities.  This cost
              accounting system will allow product and process designers to represent
              material and process costs that have an integrated cost component for
              environmental consequences.        This research will provide companies with
              financial information that should motivate behavior to optimize energy usage,
              to prevent the generation of environmental pollutants and to minimize waste
              generation.  This information will help companies provide more environmentally
              friendly products and services while improving their quality and lowering their
              costs.    ***
