Abstract    :
                This project will undertake major additions to the Rice convection  Model
              (RCM) to increase its accuracy.  1.  It will add the Rice  Open Magnetosphere
              Model (ROM) -- a highly mature, physics-based  code that ties the RCM to the
              solar wind and IMF through the  magnetopause.  2.  It will add a
              magnetofriction-equilibrium  relaxation technique to achieve article and field
              self-consistency.   3.  It will ad a algorithm to take account of internal
              plasma  sources and losses.
