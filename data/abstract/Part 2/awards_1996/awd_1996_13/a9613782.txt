Abstract    :
              9613782  Harmon    Through this planning grant the Center for the Study of
              testing,  Evaluation and Educational Policy (CSTEEP) will assess the 
              feasibility of broadly implementing performance based student  assessments
              across Local Systemic Change (LSC) Projects.  One or  more prototype sites will
              be identified to determine the potential  level of interest to develop overall
              district design, to revise  assessment instruments and reporting software to
              meet state and  local needs to pilot test assessment instruments and
              accompanying  professional development strategies for teachers.  Results from 
              this planning activity would provide design elements and resource  estimates
              for a full proposal that would implement a student  assessment component across
              all LSC sites.
