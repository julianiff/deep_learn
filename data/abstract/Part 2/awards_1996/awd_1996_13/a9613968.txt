Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT  EEC-9613968  Messing    This award is to allow the
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC)at the Pennsylvania
              State University for Particulate Materials to collaborate with the I/UCRC at
              Rutgers The State University for Ceramics on research on the fundamental
              scientific and engineering methodology for identifying and implementing optimal
              routes for mixing particulate raw materials that impart controlled
              microstructure and properties for multi-phased ceramics.  The physical blending
              of chemically different particulates is fundamental to a number of core
              industries other than ceramics, for example, powder metallurgy, mineral
              processing, pharmaceuticals, etc.  The research includes processing of
              particulates, modeling of mixing, processing of electronic ceramic mixtures and
              ceramic metal mixtures, characterization of microstructure and properties of
              the resulting specimens, and modeling of the entire processing regime. 
              Transmission electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy will be one of
              the major characterization tools/techniques.    ??
