              Abstract  ATM-9613748  K.Y. Kim and G. R. North  Texas A & M Univ.  Title: 
              Studies and Applications of Cyclostationary Empirical  Orthogonal Functions   
              This study proposes to investigate climate related Cyclo Stationary  (CS)
              processes by methods developed by the PIs in an earlier pilot  project.  The
              aim here is to provide relevant understanding and  tools for analyzing CS
              processes.  CSEOFs are the basic ingredients  of this work.  These are like
              Fourier basis functions for  stationary series.  Here the PIs intend to develop
              the theory and  construct simple algorithms and apply the methods for some 
              applications.  CSEOF method of climate data analysis assists in  better
              detection prediction and interpolation of climate signals  that are generally
              mixed up with noise.
