Abstract    :
              PI: Alma Hernandez           Laredo Community College requests support from NSF
              to acquire  communications lines required to connect to the Internet.  THENET,
              a midlevel network in the in the state of Texas, will  provide operations
              management and information services and it  will give the campus access to the
              Internet, a collection of  interoperable networks that connect most research
              and education  organizations in the United States.    Laredo Community College
              needs the Internet connection to be able  to access information resources
              throughout the state, the nation  and the world.  The connection will benefit
              the faculty, staff  students of this institution as well as the community in
              general.
