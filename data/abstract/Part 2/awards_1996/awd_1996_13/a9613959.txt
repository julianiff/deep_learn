Abstract    :
              This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of 
              NCRI's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers 
              K-12 education institutions (including vocational technical schools),  public
              libraries and museums.  It provides partial support for two years  for a T1
              wireless connection between the Potsdam Central School and SUNY's  residence
              halls.  This arrangement allows them to share a T1 link to the  Internet,
              taking advantage of the high school's use of the link during the  day and the
              university residence halls' use of it during the evenings and  nights.
