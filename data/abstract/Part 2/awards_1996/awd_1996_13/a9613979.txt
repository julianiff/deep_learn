Abstract    :
              9613979  Arakawa       This award provides continued support for a research
              project devoted to the  improving the representation of the physical processes
              relating to humidity and cloud  fields in numerical models of the global
              atmosphere.  In large part, the new research   represents a continuation of
              activities and involves a broad range of topics.  Among  them are the
              development of a global version of a hybrid vertical coordinate model  which
              will be used to simulate frontal clouds ;  assessing the impact of including
              ice  phase processes in a cloud updraft/downdraft model;  improvement, based on
              cloud  ensemble model results , of the cumulus parameterization;  a statistical
              analysis of  observations with a view to cumulus parameterizability; 
              formulation of the decaying  process for ice clouds;  improving the formulation
              of the planetary boundary layer  moisture budget;  and the development of the
              parameterization of orographic gravity  waves.           Dr. Arakawa is
              acknowledged to be one of the great leaders in the field of  numerical modeling
              of the atmosphere and continues to be quite productive.  This  project is
              supported jointly  by the NSF through this award and NASA through a  separate
              award.  ***
