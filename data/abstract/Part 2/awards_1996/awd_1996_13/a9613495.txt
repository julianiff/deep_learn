Abstract    :
              Socioeconomic research has devoted considerable effort to measuring the value
              individuals attach to environmental goods and services that markets fail to
              price. The goal of this research has been to elicit the `given` or prior
              preferences of individuals and to use those data to guide policy concerned with
              maximizing individual and social well-being.  A complement to this approach has
              emerged from recent philosophical research on democracy and deliberative
              processes. From this perspective, the individual, rather than serving simply as
              a bearer of prior preferences, joins in a social process in which public values
              are constructed. Economists, sociologists, and other social scientists are now
              developing new research approaches to determine the extent to which the
              valuation of environmental goods can benefit from discursive, information-rich,
              and deliberative experimental methods.   The project intends to shape and
              inform these experimental methods in socioeconomic research by relating them to
              work in political theory and philo sophy that emphasizes processes of social
              learning, exchange, and identification.  The investigators also propose to
              analyze the policy relevance of data that emerge from group discourse,
              deliberation, and consideration of evidence - -  data which may reflect
              judgments individuals make not about their own well -being but about the
              objectives of the community as a whole.
