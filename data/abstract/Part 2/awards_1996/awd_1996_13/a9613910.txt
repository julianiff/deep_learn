Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial 
              support for an OC-3 ATM connection to the Very High Performance Backbone 
              Network Service (vBNS).  Applications include a Grand Challenge project, "A 
              Numerical Laboratory for Multi-model, Multi-domain Computational Methods in 
              Aerodynamics and Acoustics;" Chesapeake Bay Virtual Environment visual  model;
              Interactive Remote Instruction Project;  and the Distributed Object 
              Computational Testbed.  Collaborating institutions include Argonne National 
              Laboratory, National Center for Supercomputer Applications, University of 
              California-Berkeley, University of Illinois-Chicago, San Diego  Supercomputer
              Center, Cal Tech, and Cray Research, as well as several other  Virginia
              schools.
