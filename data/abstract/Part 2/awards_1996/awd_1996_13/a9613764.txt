              Diego  Title: Direct Validation of GCM Parameterizations Against TOGA-  COARE
              Observations    This grant supports a program of research that uses TOGA COARE
              data  sets for the testing and validation of physical parameterizations  used
              in numerical climate models.  The focus is on the  parameterization of
              atmospheric convection and cloud radiation  interactions.  The idea is to use a
              one dimensional diagnostic  model of the atmospheric column overlying a region
              of the size of  a single GCM (General Circulation Model) grid cell coupled to a
               mixed layer ocean model.  Horizontal flux convergences are  specified by the
              observed COARE data and the Single Column Model  (SCM) is integrated in time. 
              The SCM output like temperature,  humidity, clouds and their properties,
              diabatic heating terms,  surface energy balance terms etc. are compared with
              observations  and scientific inferences are drawn.  This work will not only 
              result in comparing different parameterizations but also in  improving them and
              in turn the climate models are also.
