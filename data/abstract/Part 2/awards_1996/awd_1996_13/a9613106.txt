Abstract    :
              Greenblatt  9613106    The object of this project is the synthesis and 
              characterization of new, reduced-transition metal compounds  with
              quasi-low-dimensional properties.  Systems of interest  include 1)  transition
              metal (Ta and W) bronzes;  2)  niobium, and rhenium cluster compounds; and  3)
              transition  metal chalcogenides with ThCr2Si2 structures.  The focus of  the
              experimental program is to synthesize new materials of  strongly correlated
              electron systems that are on the verge  of electronic and structural
              instabilities, and to fine-tune  the competing electronic interactions through
              the unstable  region in a controlled way.  Particular emphasis will be  placed
              on the preparation of single crystal specimens to  study the structural and
              orientation-dependent physical  properties.  %%%  Transitions associated with
              the onset of charge-density  waves (CDW) and/or super-conductivity will be
              sought and  characterized.  These studies are expected to yield novel 
              materials, provide fundamental insights into correlated  electronic behavior
              and ultimately allow the enhancement and  control of electronic instabilities
              that lead to interesting  and useful macroscopic properties.  ***
