Abstract    :
              9613588  Sweeney  Streamside Reforestation: An analysis of ecological benefits
              and societal  perceptions.            Streamside forests are recommended as a
              land use practice to  protect aquatic ecosystems by removing inputs of
              nutrients, sediments, and  toxic contaminants.  This project views streamside
              forests as the primary  regulator of stream width: small forested streams are
              wider than meadow  reaches.  The alteration of stream width that results from
              deforestation  profoundly influences the stream ecosystem, both locally and
              downstream  through effects on habitat and water quality. Policies to restore 
              streamside forests will require both documentation of ecological benefits  and
              an understanding of societal factors affecting their implementation. 
              Objectives are to: (I)  understand the relationship between forest buffers, 
              width, and stream ecosystem condition; (ii) develop data bases that can  help
              guide forest restoration policies; and (iii) quantify social and  economic
              issues affecting streamside forest restoration. The ultimate goal  is to bring
              natural and social science components into focus for decision  makers.
