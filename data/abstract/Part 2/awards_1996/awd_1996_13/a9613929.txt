Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist  the Department of Chemistry at University of Miami to acquire a
              300 MHz NMR  Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
              areas including the  following: (1) characterization of cryptatium and
              fullerene species, (2) aminoorganometallics  and derivatized brevetoxins, (3)
              supramolecular electrochemistry, (4) biomolecular  recognition, and (5)
              "Lantech", "Biotech" and Nitric Oxide chemistry.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
              (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown 
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
              state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying
              out frontier research. The results  from these NMR studies are useful in the
              areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
