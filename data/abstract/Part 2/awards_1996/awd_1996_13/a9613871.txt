Abstract    :
                  This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's 
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial 
              support for a DS-3 connection to the Very High Performance Backbone Network 
              Service (vBNS) for Iowa State University and the University of Iowa for two 
              years.  Among the applications are nondestructive evaluation modeling, 
              computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, virtual environments, 
              scalable computing, nuclear magnetic resonance microimaging, and  distributed
              adaptive search systems.  Collaborating sites could include the  Cornell Theory
              Center, Maui High Performance Computing Center, NASA Lewis  and Langley
              Research Centers, and the Department of Defense High  Performance Computing
              Center.
