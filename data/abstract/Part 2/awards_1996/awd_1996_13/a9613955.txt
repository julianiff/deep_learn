Abstract    :
                This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of 
              NCRI's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers 
              K-12 education institutions (including vocational technical schools),  public
              libraries and museums.  It provides partial support for two years to  connect
              three public high schools, a business technical school and a  Catholic K-12
              school district to the Internet through a 2Mb (million bit  per second) full
              duplex spread spectrum radio transmission system.
