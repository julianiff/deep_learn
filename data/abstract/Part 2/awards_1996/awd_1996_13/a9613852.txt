Abstract    :
                The objective of this project is to obtain continuous, global,  real-time
              monitoring of the auroral size, configuration, and  dynamics for use in space
              weather specification and warning systems  and for near-term forecasting as an
              input to global circulation  models.  The method is based upon the observation
              that 0.1 - 100 Hz  magnetic fluctuations appear to be a good identifier of the
              auroral  oval at satellite altitudes.  It may be possible then to utilize 
              non-science grade magnetometers used for attitude determination on  the suites
              of commerical communication and navigation satellites to  provide continuous
              monitoring of the auroral oval.  The project  will undertake a more thorough
              investigation of the magnetic  fluctuations and will examine test data from the
               RIDIUM attitude  magnetometer to test the efficacy of the proposed method.
