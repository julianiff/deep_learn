Abstract    :
                This is a proposal to study the problem of predicting the Dst index  which is
              driven by the growth and decay of the terrestrial ring  current.  The study
              will be aimed at defining a better Dst index,  creating a quick time Dst index
              for scientific investigations, and  understanding the solar wind coupling
              function.  The proposed  approach uses both historical data and new data
              available from  satellite and ground-based instrumentation.
