Abstract    :
              9613907  Prose    This project will enable Doug Prose and Diane LaMacchia, video
               producers from Earth Images Foundation, Inc., to conduct a seven-  week film 
              trip to the Nanga Parbat region of Pakistan, during  which they will document
              research activities and landscapes related  to the study "Collaborative
              Research: Crustal Reworking During  Orogeny:  An  Active System Himalayan
              Perspective."  The producers  will use 16mm film to document major field work
              activities  undertaken by an international collaboration of scientists from the
               earth science disciplines of seismology, structural geology,  geomorphology,
              petrology, geochronology, and magnetotellurics.   Scientists will be filmed
              performing field work and discussing in  on-camera interviews their research
              and the geologic problems they  are addressing.  Relevant geologic, hydrologic,
              and other landscape  features of the Nanga Parbat region, as well as local
              cultural  features, will also be filmed.  This footage will be used in a 
              planned video and CD-ROM that will depict the ways in which earth  scientists
              join forces to tackle geologic problems present in the  Nanga Parbat region.
