Abstract    :
                The Foundation for Independent Higher Education requests support from NSF to
              connect ten of their member institutions of higher education to the Internet. 
              These include:  Anderson College, Anderson, SC, Bacone College, Muskogee, OK,
              Bartlesville Wesleyan College, Bartlesville, OK, Caldwell College, Caldwell,
              NJ,  Erksine College, Due West, SC, Lon Morris College, Jacksonville, TX, Park
              College, Parkville, MO, Schreiner College, Kerrville, TX, University of
              Charleston, Charleston, WV and Ursuline College, Pepper Pike, OH.  Each of the
              institutions funded will connect to the Internet using service providers in
              within their  respective areas.    These institutions of higher education need
              the Internet  connections to be able to access information resources throughout
               the state, the nation and the world.  The connection will benefit  the
              faculty, staff students of these institutions as well as the  community in
              general.
