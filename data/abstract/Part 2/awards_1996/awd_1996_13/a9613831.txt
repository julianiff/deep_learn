Abstract    :
              This project investigates the ionospheric perturbations impacting radio
              communication systems, and the failures of electrical power companies.  Both
              practical concerns and their associated strategic and economic impacts are
              linked by the subtleties of the interplanetary magnetic filed (IMF).  Studies
              show both of these have a severity that follows a semi-annual pattern, one with
              maxima during months spanning the equinoxes.  This is a well known effect in
              geomagnetic activity linked to IMF interactions with the terrestrial
              magnetosphere.  This project will extend the concept of such
              "geo-effectiveness" to the specification of ionospheric variability, as ordered
              and predicted by IMF geometry.  The goal is to probe the fundamental nature of
              IMF linkages to the inner terrestrial environment in order to understand how
              such major impacts as power failures can occur.
