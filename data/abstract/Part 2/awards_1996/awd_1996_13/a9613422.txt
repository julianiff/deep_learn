Abstract    :
              Abstract  9613422  Sidhu      This proposal focuses on the reduction of
              hazardous air pollutants (HAP) such as hydrocarbons, hydrochloric acid, and
              polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated furans (PCDD/F), produced
              in the production of Portland cement.  Volatilization of organics from the feed
              stock during preheating and drying and conditions in the Air Pollution Control
              (APC) device and in the transfer ducting zones appear to be primarily
              responsible for the formation of these HAPs.  Several process modifications
              such as the thermal pretreatment of feed stock, elimination of hydrocarbon
              recycle, temperature reduction in the preheat off-gas transfer duct, increased
              oxidation, and modification of preheater conditions may help reduce and/or
              prevent this HAP formation.  An experimental program is proposed in order to
              determine which of these strategies is most effective and what precise process
              modifications are necessary to implement them.  A high temperature flow
              reactor, operating in the range of 200 to 700 C will be used to study the
              speciation, partitioning, and reaction of raw meal hydrocarbons and chlorine in
              an environment containing cement kiln feed stock and NOx, O2, and water.  This
              data should enable the design of specific process modifications to prevent the
              formation and emission of HAPs from Portland cement kilns without the addition
              of control devices.
