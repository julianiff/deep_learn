Abstract    :
                Abstract    CTS-9613948  John Lumley et al  Cornell University    A wavelet
              representation of incompressible turbulent flows using divergence-free vector
              wavelets will be developed.  Better results than Fourier representations are
              expected because the coherent structures in turbulent flows have a limited
              spatial extend similar to wavelet.  The Galerkin projection of the
              Navier-Stokes equations on a divergence-free vector wavelet orthogonal basis,
              and its incorporation and comparison to the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
              (POD) approach, will be also investigated.  Comparisons to detailed
              two-dimensional Particle Image Velocimetry measurements in air performed at
              NASA Langley Research Center will be performed in order to evaluate the
              capabilities and efficiency of the wavelet decomposition.  The research work
              will be performed in collaboration with Oxford University in UK and Clarkson
              University.    If successful, the wavelet representation will offer a
              fundamentally new way to describe and analyze non-uniform flows such as large
              turbulent structures.
