Abstract    :
                  This project will better determine the conditions under which near-  Earth
              solar wind monitors can be relied upon to measure the  parameters arriving at
              the dayside magnetopause.  Using upstream  spacecraft such as IMP-8, ISEE 1/2,
              and IRM, the project will  attempt to (1) determine scale sizes of solar wind
              features, (2)  compare observed and predicted time lags for tangential and 
              rotationl discontinuities, (3) determine how well IMF Bz can be  predicted from
              upstream monitors, (4) test if high time resolution  magnetic field
              measurements can proxy for dynamic pressure, (5)  determine how the foreshock
              preconditions the solar wind, and (6)  determine how the waves generated by
              discontinuities interacting  with the bow shock propagate to the magnetopause.
