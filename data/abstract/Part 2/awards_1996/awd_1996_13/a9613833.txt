Abstract    :
              9613833  Marc Rieffel     The purpose of this project is to support research on
              a number of  interconnected topics at the frontier of modern analysis, in the
              general  area of operator algebras and group representations. These topics 
              include quantization and quantum groups, aspects of quantum topology and 
              differential geometry, and harmonic analysis on Lie groups.    Attention will
              be given to relationships with applications in such areas as  quantum mechanics
              and field theory, and signal processing.
