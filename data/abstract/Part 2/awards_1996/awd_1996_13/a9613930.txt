Abstract    :
                  The Foundation for Independent Higher Education requests support from NSF to
              connect eight of their member institutions of higher education to the Internet.
               These include:  Bloomfield College, Bloomfield, NJ, Charleston Southern
              University, Charleston, SC, Florida Southern College, Lakeland, FL, Holy Family
              College,  Philadelphia, PA, Ohio Valley College, Parkersburg, WV, Peirce
              College, Philadelphia, PA, St.  Meinrad College and School of Theology, St. 
              Meinrad, IN, and Shorter College, Rome, GA. Each of the institutions funded
              will connect to the Internet using service providers in within their respective
              areas.    These institutions of higher education need the Internet connections
              to be able to access information resources throughout the state, the nation and
              the world.  The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of these
              institutions as well as the  community in general.
