Abstract    :
              An important space weather prediction tool is the ability to reconstruct the
              coronal magnetic field above solar active regions from observations of the
              vector magnetic field at the photosphere.  A variety of numerical methods for
              computing the coronal field from the boundary data have been developed over the
              last ten years.  The logical next step is evaluating the performance of the
              various existing numerical codes side by side on both synthetic and real data. 
              This project will coordinate such an effort:  test datasets will be produced
              and distributed to collaborators, tools for analyzing and comparing results
              developed, results of the analysis publicized, and a workshop organized for
              collaborators to discuss results of the comparison.
