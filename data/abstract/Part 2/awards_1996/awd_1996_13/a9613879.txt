Abstract    :
              This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of 
              NCRI's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers 
              K-12 education institutions (including vocational technical schools),  public
              libraries and museums.  It provides partial support for two years to  support a
              wireless system to allow science students to use laptop computers  in the field
              to communicate their real-time data to the school and thus to  the other
              student researchers.
