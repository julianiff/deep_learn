Abstract    :
                    9613943  Soreghan    The history of late Paleozoic climate is of great
              interest to both (paleo) climatologists and geologists.  Part of this interest
              derives from curiosity in Pangea's unique geography and correspondingly unique
              climate.  Another part derives from a more applied interest:  Upper Paleozoic
              strata of Pangea house significant resources.  Most recent studies cite
              glacioeustasy as the first-order control on upper Paleozoic strata, but
              intracyclic climate change likely accompanied late Paleozoic glacioeustasy. 
              Currently, the evidence for and character of this high-frequency climate change
              is poorly constrained.  The objective of this research is to test the
              feasibility of obtaining high-resolution paleoclimatic data from upper
              Paleozoic loessite-paleosol sequences using an integrated
              paleomagnetic-sedimentologic approach.  Recent research on Cenozoic
              loess-paleosol sequences indicates that variations in magnetic susceptibility
              correlate with changes in paleoclimate.  To investigate the application of this
              paleomagnetic approach to the Paleozoic, magnetic susceptibility will be
              measured through an upper Paleozoic loessite-paleosol sequence located in
              western Pangea (Ancestral Rocky Mountains).  Patterns in magnetic
              susceptibility will be integrated with sedimentologic observations to identify
              paleoclimatic fluctuations.  Paleomagnetic and rock magnetic analyses will be
              performed to (1) characterize the magnetization and (2) assess possible
              remagnetization.  If successful, this approach will provide data on the
              paleoclimate of low-latitude western Pangea that can be used to address
              fundamental and applied research questions.
