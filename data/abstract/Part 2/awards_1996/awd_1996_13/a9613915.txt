Abstract    :
                  This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of 
              NCRI's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers 
              K-12 education institutions (including vocational technical schools),  public
              libraries and museums.  It provides partial support for two years  for an
              inverse multiplexing system for connecting to the Internet.  Four  voice-grade
              telephone lines are multiplexed to provide approximately  100,000 bit per
              second bandwidth.  A file server is located at the school  to cache data
              retrievals made over the Internet.  For subsequent  retrievals, the server is
              checked first so that duplicate retrievals can be  eliminated, thereby reducing
              traffic over the multiplexed lines.
