Abstract    :
              The PI will conduct a three-year program to develop a short-term forecasting
              capability for propagation disturbances in the equatorial ionosphere. 
              Specifically, he will address the day-to-day variability in the development of
              plasma structure in the nighttime equatorial ionosphere.  This will be
              accomplished with a meridional chain of ionospheric stations that spans the
              magnetic dip equator.  This chain will enable simultaneous measurements in the
              plasma-density distribution as a function of altitude and dip latitude in both
              hemispheres.  Moreover, measurements of the neutral wind will not be necessary.
               Specific aims of the project are:  (1) simultaneously measure the
              plasma-density distribution as a function of altitude and dip latitude, along a
              magnetic meridian in both hemispheres, (2) measure conjugate E-region
              characteristics in both hemispheres during the development of ESF, (3) evaluate
              the precursor signature for ESF development using measurements in both
              hemispheres, (4) perform comprehensive tests of various short-term forecasting
              methods, and (5) measure the longitudinal correlation of nightly ESF
              development.
