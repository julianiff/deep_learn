Abstract    :
              9613258  Watts  Physicochemical processes that can enhance the biodegradability 
              of biorefractory organic compounds in process water can serve as  a basis for
              waste reduction, toxicity reduction, and water  conservation through the
              recycling.  The proposed research  investigates coexisting chemical and
              biological oxidations in  hybrid advanced oxidation process (AOP)-biological
              systems.  The  AOP is an iron oxyhydroxide-catalyzed Fentonlike reaction in 
              which hydroxyl radicals are generated by heterogeneous catalysis  at the
              mineral surface.  Abiotic-biotic systems containing low  microbial numbers may
              be dominated by Fenton-like oxidations.  Conversely, systems with high biomass
              would likely be  characterized by fewer Fenton-like oxidations because the 
              hydrogen peroxide would be decomposed by catalase.  However,  under optimal
              proportions of abiotic and biotic mechanisms,  hydroxyl radicals generated in a
              microenvironment at the mineral  surface would modify biorefractory compounds
              and subsequent  transformation of the oxidation products would then be promoted
               by a coexisting consortium of aerobic bacteria.    Perchloroethylene will be
              used as a hydroxyl radical probe.  13C-  labeled pyruvate will be used to 
              assay microbial metabolism.  A series of experiments will  investigate
              interactions of biomass, hydrogen peroxide  concentration, iron oxyhydroxide
              mineral concentration, and  phosphate stabilization of hydrogen peroxide in
              promoting  parallel abiotic-biotic oxidations.  Transformation reactions  will
              be confirmed by monitoring 14C-labeled perchloroethylene;  degradation products
              will be tracked by gas chromatography/mass  spectrometry and liquid
              chromatography/mass spectrometry of 13C-  labeled perchloroethylene to
              differentiate its products from the  mass spectra of natural organic compounds.
               The results will  provide fundamental data that can be applied to on site
              hybrid  abiotic-biotic systems.  ***
