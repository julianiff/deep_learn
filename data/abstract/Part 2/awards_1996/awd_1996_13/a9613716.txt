              PI: - S. Vogel    Astronomy with the BIMA Array    The
              Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Array (BIMA) is a millimeter-wave  interferometer
              presently made up of 9 six-meter diameter  antennas; at least two other
              antennas will be added to the array  during the next 5 years. located at
              Berkeley's Hat Creek Radio  Observatory, BIMA was jointly capitalized and is
              jointly operated  by the University of California at Berkeley, the University
              of  Illinois and the University of Maryland through a combination of  NSF and
              State funding.    These awards are for identical proposals submitted
              simultaneously  by each institution, and support astronomical research, 
              technological development and student training carried out at the  BIMA array.
              Astronomical research at BIMA includes high  resolution studies of solar system
              objects, stellar envelopes,  star-forming regions in the Galaxy, and molecular
              clouds in  external galaxies. Notable accomplishments during the past three 
              years at BIMA include expansion from 6 to 9 elements, and the  extension of the
              array baselines to provide angular resolutions  better than 0.5 arcsecond.
              These technical advancements permitted  BIMA scientists to obtain the first
              resolved image of a young  circumstellar disk, and to discover a molecular bar
              at the core  of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, and to confirm the discovery of 
              interstellar acetic acid. Scientific plans under the new award  will focus
              heavily on exploiting the recently-achieved higher  speed and resolution of the
              array. In the technical domain, BIMA  staff will concentrate attempting to use
              total power fluctuations  to remove the phase fluctuations caused by the
              atmosphere when  operating over long baselines.
