Abstract    :
                This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's 
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial 
              support for an OC-3 connection to the Chicago NAP and to Fermilab for two 
              years.  Among the numerous applications are those involving distributed  high
              performance computing, remote visualization, gigabit imaging,  network-based
              collaboration, simulations and modeling in astronomy and  astrophysics, and
              advanced digital video.  Collaborating sites include  Argonne National
              Laboratory and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.
