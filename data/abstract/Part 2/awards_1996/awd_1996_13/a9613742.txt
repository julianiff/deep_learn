Abstract    :
                Abstract  CTS-9613742  Juan dePablo, U. of Wisconsin - Madison    Large-scale
              atomistic computer simulations of clay swelling by aqueous electrolyte
              solutions will be performed, and compared to experiments.  The "expanded
              ensemble" molecular dynamics approach, developed by the P.I. for polymer gels,
              will be extended to clay studies.  A connection is made between the molecular
              microstructure and macroscopic behavior of the respective materials.  While the
              dynamic simulation research is performed at the University of Wisconsin
              (Madison), the complementary experimental clay research is carried out at the
              National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).  This award will provide
              support for travel between the two partners.    This project was submitted in
              response to the NSF-CONACyT Collaborative Research Opportunities Announcement
              (NSF 96-145).  A parallel proposal was submitted by UNAM to CONACyT, and an
              award was recommended by CONACyT.    The research has primary relevance to soil
              mechanics and the stability of oil recovery wells.
