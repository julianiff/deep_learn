Abstract    :
              9613865  Ma    This research deals with metallic alloys that are far  removed
              from equilibrium, namely amorphous alloys and  supersaturated nanocrystalline
              solid solutions.  The focus  is on metastable phase formation using solid-state
               processing techniques in binary systems characterized by a  large positive
              heat of mixing.  A systematic experimental  approach should lead to clearer
              understanding of the  formation of metastable phases and their transformations
              in  immiscible systems.  Scientific areas explored include the  mechanisms
              responsible for amorphization observed in some  mechanically-alloyed binary
              immiscible systems; limitations  to the extent of alloying in such systems; the
              degree of  stability in these metastable phases; the degree of short  range
              clustering; and the similarities and differences in  thermodynamic behavior of
              immiscible alloys prepared through  different solid-state techniques. 
              Measurement techniques  employed include calorimetry, transmission electron 
              microscopy, thermodynamic modeling, and extended X-ray  absorption fine
              structure analysis.  %%%  Development of the fundamentals of thermodynamic and
              kinetic  phenomena of immiscible alloy systems is needed to  understand their
              synthesis, structure, and stability.  ***
