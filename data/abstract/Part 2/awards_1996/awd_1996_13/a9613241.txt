              ABSTRACT       The project is a combined computational and experimental effort
              at developing a generic field-enhanced continuous electrophoretic separation of
              chiral pesticides.  The process is three-dimensional, and amplifies small
              electrophoretic mobility difference into large variations in azithumal
              displacement in an annulus, using an axisymmetric swirl flow.  Enantioselective
              complexation with a chiral species provides the electrophoretic mobility
              difference.  Computational work will focus on the effects of diffusion, field
              strength, geometry and swirl.  Buoyant or electrohydrodynamic secondary flows
              will also be evaluated.  The electrophoresis cell will be fabricated at NIST,
              where experiments will focus on the separation of herbicide enantiomers.  The
              project may lead to an economical alternative to chiral separation for both
              commercial production and developmental testing.  This will reduce the
              application levels of chiral pesticides and their environmental burden.
