Abstract    :
              Abstract  ATM-9613776  Wang, Bin  University of Hawaii  Title: Dynamics of the
              Coupled Warm Pool System and ENSO  Development    This study is aimed at
              understanding the coupling processes between  the atmosphere and the ocean over
              the Western Pacific Warm Pool  (WPWP).  The focus is on the Intra-Seasonal
              Oscillation (ISO) in  the Pacific which might be effecting the climate over
              longtime  scales.     The study will synthesize and utilize TC data to develop
              both  conceptual and process models suitable for describing the essential 
              physics of the warm pool system and to understand the multiple  interaction
              that extends the influence of the warm pool system to  other regions and vice
              versa.    This research is important because it seeks to improve our capacity 
              to make useful prediction of seasonal to interannual climate  variations.
