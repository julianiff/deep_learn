Abstract    :
              9613647  Rose    This Americas Program award will support a collaborative 
              research project between  Drs.William Rose, and James  Vallance, Michigan
              Technological University, and Eric  Casamiquela, Comision Ejecutiva del Rio
              Lempa (CEL), El  Salvador.  Scientists from other U.S. Universities and from 
              the U.S. Geological Survey, as well as the Universidad  Centroamericana (UCA),
              and Universidad de El Salvador (UES),  will also collaborate in the project. 
              The award includes  support   for several U.S. graduate students and a post- 
              doctoral researcher.    The study will focus on the active volcanoes of El
              Salvador.  The chief goals are to achieve an understanding of  significant
              volcanic hazards through standard field methods,  and to build an
              infrastructure for responding to, and  mitigating, volcanic hazards in the
              region.  The proposal is  aimed at El Salvador because of the abundance of
              excellent  research problems there, and because the geological record 
              indicates that volcanism of types and on scales  unprecedented during historic
              time may recur in the region.  Thus, an understanding of the  possible nature
              of such  events will be necessary in order to mitigate potential  future
              hazards successfully.  ***
