Abstract    :
              9613958  Goodman-Strauss       The 21st conference of the University of Arkansas
              Annual Lecture Series  in the Mathematical Sciences will bring together experts
              in the field of  Dehn Surgery in Three-Manifolds, which is one of the most
              vital and active  areas of topology at the present time.  This meeting will
              provide a forum  for an exchange of ideas as well as an opportunity for young
              researchers  and graduate students to interact with prominent researchers in
              their area.  Cameron M. Gordon of the University of Texas at Austin will be the
              principal  speaker and will deliver a series of five fifty-minute lectures
              entitled  Dehn Surgery.  At least a dozen forty-minute talks on related matters
               will be given by others, and a large number of shorter contributed papers 
              will round out the program.  ***
