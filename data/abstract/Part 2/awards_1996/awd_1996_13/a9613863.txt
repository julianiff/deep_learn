Abstract    :
              The PI plans to use TOPEX/POSEIDON data to analyze the spatial structure and
              temporal evolution of the ionosphere.  In particular, he is interested in TEC
              manifestations of the response of the middle and low latitude ionosphere to
              geomagnetic storms and in TEC wave signatures.  This data analysis procedure
              will also prepare TEC data for utilization in other objectives of the space
              weather program.  The data provide an excellent database for model validation
              purposes, especially important over large ocean areas where ionosonde, GPS TEC,
              or other ground-based data are not available.  TEC measurements from the
              TOPEX/POSEIDON mission are an ideal data set for the validation of the new
              understanding of ionospheric storm effect distributions.
