Abstract    :
              9613710  Hovis  The proposed research will focus on several important questions
              concerning the energies of mineral and rock processes.  The energetics of
              water-bearing magmatic systems will be investigated by measuring the enthalpies
              of solution of hydrous rhyolite, andesite and basalt glasses.  In a second
              project, the enthalpies of mixing for simple alkali-silica glasses will be
              investigate.  In a third project, heats of solution will be used to
              energetically characterize the remnant structures of decompressed amorphous
              materials.  Other projects relate to enthalpies associated with strain in
              coherently exsolved minerals and with highly precise thermodynamic mixing in
              feldspars and other mineral systems.  The principal techniques to be utilized
              for these studies include hydrofluoric acid solution calorimetry, room
              temperature/pressure and high-pressure x-ray powder diffraction, and nuclear
              magnetic resonance plus other spectroscopies.
