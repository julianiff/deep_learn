Abstract    :
              Barron   9613068         The traditional methods for alumina synthesis and
              fabrication are traditional ceramic methods and sol-gel, both of which have
              serious environmental impacts. The objective of this research project is to
              develop environmentally-benign processing for the fabrication of alumina
              ceramics.  The research  is focused on the following tasks:  (1) design of an
              alternative synthesis pathway to alumina ceramics which does not utilize toxic
              reagents or solvents; (2) applying the new materials as alternatives to present
              technology to prevent or reduce environmental harm; and (3) applying the new
              materials and processes to the development of a cost effective method for the
              highly efficient pollution prevention and resource recovery.  The scope of the
              project includes fundamental research into aqueous processing of
              alumina-precursors, their processing into a formable slip, and the fabrication
              and characteristics of solid ceramic bodies from this slip.       The research
              is targeted to two potential applications:  (1) high-density tape-cast alumina
              substrates; and (2) porous ultra- and nano-filtration membrane.   These
              improvements have potential applications in pollution prevention and control.
