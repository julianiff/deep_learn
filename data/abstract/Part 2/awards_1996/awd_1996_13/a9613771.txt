Abstract    :
              An extensive data set of Lagrangian measurements of sea  surface temperature, 
              sea surface salinity and mixed layer circulation will used  in conjunction with
               Eulerian measurements from other sources (moorings from the  Tropical Ocean 
              Global Atmosphere (TOGA) program's observing system and  moorings deployed 
              during the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment  (COARE)) to  assemble
              a space-time description of the surface circulation  and sea level of the 
              western tropical Pacific Ocean over a 40-month period. The  goal is to
              determine  the horizontal structure and evolution of the advective  properties
              of oceanic  dynamic fields in the tropical mixed layer on time scales of  days
              to months. In  addition, the hypothesis that large spatial scale variations  of
              heat and salinity at  the equator are determined by advection from wind-driven 
              Yoshida jets will be  examined. The upper ocean data set will also be used to 
              parameterize the near  surface turbulent flux convergence as a function of
              surface  fluxes, provide an  alternate way to determine surface fluxes.
