Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT  EEC-9613967  Niesz    This award is to allow the Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC)at the Pennsylvania State University for
              Particulate Materials to collaborate with the I/UCRC at Rutgers The State
              University for Ceramics on research on the fundamental scientific and
              engineering methodology for identifying and implementing optimal routes for
              mixing particulate raw materials that impart controlled microstructure and
              properties for multi-phased ceramics.  The physical blending of chemically
              different particulates is fundamental to a number of core industries other than
              ceramics, for example, powder metallurgy, mineral processing, pharmaceuticals,
              etc.  The research includes processing of particulates, modeling of mixing,
              processing of electronic ceramic mixtures and ceramic metal mixtures,
              characterization of microstructure and properties of the resulting specimens,
              and modeling of the entire processing regime.  Transmission electron
              microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy will be one of the major
              characterization tools/techniques.    ??
