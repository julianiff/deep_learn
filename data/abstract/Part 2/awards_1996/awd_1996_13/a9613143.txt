Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:  CTS-9613143  Principal Investigator:  Spall,
              Utah State    The objectives of this investigation, involving two universities,
              are: (i) To carry out complementary experimental and numerical research in
              order to explore the structure and dynamics of vortex breakdown in turbulent
              swirling flows; (ii) To elucidate the physics of the phenomena and provide
              archival-quality experimental data for the assessment and validation of CFD
              codes with anisotropic turbulence models and for current as well as future
              scientific and technological developments; (iii) To carefully assess existing
              phenomenological models; (iv) To develop an understanding of the consequences
              of turbulence on vortex breakdown for its intellectual challenge and
              technological applications in aerodynamics, in combustion, and in general, in
              the development of effective flow control strategies in devices employing swirl
              dynamics.  It is intended that this study would lead to reliable computer codes
              which might be used for industrial research and design.    This grant is for
              the numerical component.  A matching grant was made to the Naval Postgraduate
              School for the experimental phase (CTS-9612528).
