Abstract    :
              Abstract      ***    Phillips  9613883  This research undertakes ethnographic
              and ethnohistorical  analyses focusing on issues surrounding land litigation to
              study community-level negotiation and resolution within a pluralist legal
              system.  Little research has heretofore focused on local legal practices of the
              citizens in post-colonial states and the role these legal negotiations play in
              question of national  identity.  By studying contemporary and historical land
              cases, the investigators explore change in the legal and social definitions of
              custom over time.  The project explores the differing ways the indigenous
              population and the legal system use and define customs.  This work evaluates
              the theory that evolving definitions of custom are directly related to
              processes at the state level in defining national identity.  Interviews with
              local people, judges, and attorneys involved in land cases in the Commonwealth
              of the Northern Mariana Islands in Micronesia,  and archival records will
              provide data to address these questions.  This work contributes to our basic
              understanding of the development of legal rules.
