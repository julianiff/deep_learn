Abstract    :
                This proposal requests support to continue investigations of the  interaction
              of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere.   Heikkila challenges the
              most widely accepted model of energy and  momentum coupling which is the Dungey
              reconnection model later  updated by Cowley and Lockwood.  While Heikkila
              agrees that a  connection between geomagnetic field lines occurs, he challenges
               the physical reasoning behind the present reconnection paradigm.   The
              requested support would permit Heikkila to continue analysis of  data, develop
              a collaboration with a computer simulation team to  further test his concepts
              and attend scientific meetings.
