Abstract    :
              9613370  Richey    Toward an Integrated Regional Model of River Basins of the
              Pacific Rim    This research will contribute to the creation of a
              regional-scale, integrated model of the active processes and functioning of
              river basin systems within the Pacific Rim.  The PI will focus on the
              development and application of spatial modeling and data synthesis with a
              particular emphasis on East and Southeast Asia.  Data from the Changjiang
              (China), Mekong (SE Asia) and Cagayani (philippines) Rivers will be used in a
              modification of a model structure originally developed for the Amazon basin. 
              The investigation will specifically address issues related to the space and
              time scale of physical data used to define, characterize, and model large river
              basins.
