Abstract    :
              CTS - 9613489  Michael Doherty  Michael Malone  Universityof Massachusetts
              Amherst      ABSTRACT       The project is an evaluation of a generic approach
              to integrate chemical reactions with distillation.  Current designs are
              generally based on repeated simulations and cannot deal effectively with
              reactive azeotropes.  Geometric methods offer a more effective and systematic
              approach that preserves essential information on the complex interrelations
              among operating conditions, phase behavior, chemical reaction rates, and
              reaction equilibria.  The project will focus on the development of a theory and
              general methods that include the effects of chemical kinetics.  This will be
              pursued in parallel with experimental validation of geometric methods for
              equilibrium reactive distillation.  Reactive distillation offers potential
              breakthroughs in productivity, yield and waste reduction in chemical
              manufacturing.
