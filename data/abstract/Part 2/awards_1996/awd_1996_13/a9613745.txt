Abstract    :
              This project will address the physical nature of irregularities in the
              bottomside F-region equatorial ionosphere.  These processes are a significant
              contributor to equatorial ionosphere weather, and can affect the performance of
              HF communication and over-the-horizon radar systems.  The investigators will
              conduct a low-cost experimental campaign using the dual coherent and incoherent
              radar capabilities at Jicamarca to study the genre of irregularities known as
              bottomside spread-F.  They will use numerical simulation modeling of the
              F-layer in conjunction with the observational data to formulate a theoretical
              basis for observations and provide predictive capability for the occurrence of
              bottomside spread-F and full scale equatorial spread-F.
