Abstract    :
              Lee    9613937      This is a workshop award entitled "Manufacturing Polymer
              Composites by Liquid Molding" that will be held in Columbus, OH, June 13-14,
              1996.  The objective of the workshop is to identify strategic research
              activities to advance scientific understanding in Manufacturing of Liquid
              Polymer Composite.  Approximately 100 people will be invited to participate
              including speakers from academia, industry, and government.   The workshop will
              focus on the following topics: (1.) Performing Fundamentals  (2.) Performing
              Technology, and  (3.) Materials Characterization.  In addition, a computer
              demonstration session is scheduled introducing different flow modeling codes to
              the same place for comparison and evaluation.  Proceedings from the workshop
              will be prepared and published by Engineering Research Center for Net Shape
              Manufacturing.
