Abstract    :
              Abstract  9613966  Persson    This award provides funding for a two-year
              phaseout of the NSF/Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
              Energetic Materials and support of an undergraduate student to participate in
              the research of the Center.    This Center will provide an ongoing research and
              development organization for work on the safety of energetic materials,
              particularly those which are now increasingly stored, transported, and used in
              large quantities and which have relevance to RCEMOs member companies.  The main
              research focus of the projects being undertaken is directed towards reducing
              the environmental effects of large explosions, fire hazards, and increasing the
              safety in processing of energetic materials.  The Center will continue to
              collaborate with its corporate and government sponsors and it is expected that
              this support will grow.
