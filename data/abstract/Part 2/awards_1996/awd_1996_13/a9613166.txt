Abstract    :
              9613166  Russell    The proposed research has two thrusts;  one involves using 
              carbon dioxide (CO2) as either a reactant, solvent or both,  and the other uses
              enzymes as heterogeneous catalysts in CO2  to promote required reactions
              selectively at low  temperatures. CO2 will be used as the solvent during the 
              enzymatic polymerization of diols and diesters to form  polyester polyols
              (hydroxy-capped polyesters).  Polyester  polyols are important constituents of
              polyurethane  elastomers.  Presently, they are generated via the high 
              temperature reaction of diols with diacids.  Constant  removal of water is used
              to drive the reaction to  completion.  Pollution prevention will be
              accomplished  through energy savings related to low temperature operation,  as
              well as elimination of cyclic byproducts through use of  the enzyme, lipase. 
              The enzyme may enable the generation of  dihydroxy capped material without
              resorting to high  stoichiometric imbalances, thus reducing waste.    In
              addition, the use of enzymes in concert with a pressure-  tunable solvent such
              as CO2 enables the production of  polyesters with narrow molecular weight
              distributions.  Such  materials are presently unavailable using conventional 
              condensation polyester synthetic techniques. The proposed  research also will
              investigate the details of the  polymerization process in an attempt to
              rationally design a  continuous method for synthesis of polyol polyester 
              intermediates for the urethane industry.    CO2 will be used as a raw material,
              in concert with  enzymatic catalysis, in the synthesis of diphenyl carbamate, 
              the monomer for bisphenol A polycarbonate (BAPC), a widely  used thermoplastic.
              Current processes for  production of  diphenyl carbonate require phosgene as a
              raw material,  generating  large quantities of waste salt and organic  solvent.
               A two-step reaction, where CO2  is used in the  first step to generate a
              dialkyl carbonate, followed by an  enzymatically catalyzed transesterification,
              will be used to  produce diphenyl c arbonate.  If successful, the research 
              will use reactants and processes that save energy, minimize  waste and use an
              environmentally benign solvent.
