Abstract    :
                This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's 
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial 
              support for an OC-3 connection to provide access to the Very High  Performance
              Backbone Network Service (vBNS) and Collaborative Advanced  Interagency
              Research Network (CAIRN) for two years.  Among the applications  are the
              Virtual World Data Server, Data Mining of Geophysical Data, UCLA  Earth System
              Model, and Distributed Real-Time Simulation.  Collaborating  sites could
              include the Cornell Theory Center and San Diego Supercomputer  Center.
