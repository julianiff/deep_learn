Abstract    :
              This grant will support both research and continued operations of two neutron
              monitors at Climax, Colorado and Haleakala, Hawaii.  The research will
              investigate the physics of the electrodynamical processes in three dimensions
              in the inner heliosphere, with special emphasis on the solar-terrestrial
              region.  For instance, the PI's neutron monitors have discovered that as the
              Ulysses spacecraft travels towards the Sun's polar regions, the recurrent
              26-day modulation continues to be seen to extremely high latitudes, beyond the
              extent of the magnetic field and plasma structures (previously thought to
              control these variations).  The neutron monitors continued their measurements
              of these same variations, implying the mechanism for recurrent modulation must
              be a global, large-scale phenomenon, extending throughout the inner
              heliosphere.  This mechanism will be pursued over the next few years.  Further,
              the PI has the longest running neutron monitor records, covering more than two
              solar magnetic cycles.  This will enable further exploration of the role of
              gradient drifts in the modulation of galactic cosmic rays, which reach the top
              of the atmosphere.  The PI will continue long-term studies of the apparent
              bimodal character of cosmic ray modulation through the next solar minimum. 
              Finally, the PI will continue support and upgrade of the two neutron monitors.
