Abstract    :
              Abstract  9613904  Chase and Jacobs  Akron University    This a GOALI "Industry
              on Campus" project where Dr. K. Jacobs, an expert in bulk solids handling from
              Dow Chemical Co. (Midland, MI) will team with Dr. G.G. Chase, a professor at
              the University of Akron (OH), to teach and develop corresponding notes for a
              course on solids processing.  The course will cover areas of special interest
              to particle sciences and industry, including  gaseous suspension and liquid
              slurry processing, and handling and storage of bulk powders.  The industrial
              partner will bring to the classroom phenomena and mechanisms of  relevance to
              applications, and analyze case studies of significance to chemical processing
              industry.   The visiting expert from industry has extensive industrial
              experience, is internationally recognized for his expertise, and taught
              numerous courses on particle technology.  A unique feature of the proposed
              activity is the preparation of a set of  case studies showing how basic
              principles apply in practice.
