Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's 
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial 
              support for OC-3 ATM connections to Rice University, Baylor College of 
              Medicine and the University of Houston for two years.  Among the numerous 
              applications are those involving distributed parallel computing, immersive 
              collaborative environments, imaging for molecular genetics and structural 
              biology, computational biology and bioinformatics,  and computational 
              engineering.
