Abstract    :
              This project researches the energy release and particle acceleration mechanism
              in solar flares.  The source of flare energy is the current-carrying magnetic
              field, and the bulk of this energy goes into the acceleration of particles, but
              exactly how the energy is dissipated or accelerates particles is uncertain. 
              Direct heating, acceleration, and production of plasma waves or turbulence are
              possible dissipation channels.  The PI will gain insight through comparing
              microwave, hard X-ray and gamma-ray observations with theoretical results in a
              gradual process, where lower foundations of understanding will proceed to more
              complex situations.  Specifically, he will determine (1) if the background
              thermal plasma particles can be accelerated efficiently, (2) how effectively
              the observations can be explained, and (3) what new testable predictions can be
              made.  The project will support one graduate student, and result in an
              important understanding of the flare problem, as well as giving useful
              information about magnetospheric phenomena around the earth, other planets,
              compact stars, and nuclei of active galaxies.
