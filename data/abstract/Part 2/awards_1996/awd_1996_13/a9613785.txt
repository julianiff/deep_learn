Abstract    :
                  This NSF-CONACyT Collaborative Renewal Award continues to apply  techniques
              from the abstract mathematical area of simplicial  algebraic topology
              (developed under CCR-9505949) to the  problem of coordinating concurrent
              processes in a  distributed or parallel computing system.  Coordination 
              problems arise at all scales of modern distributed and  concurrent systems, way
              from synchronizing access to shared  data objects in tightly-coupled
              multiprocessors, to  allocating data paths in ATM networks.  Coordination is 
              difficult because modern parallel and distributed systems  are inherently
              asynchronous (that is, processes may be  delayed without warning for a variety
              of reasons, including  interrupts, pre-emption, cache misses, communication
              delays,  or failures).  These delays can vary enormously in scale:  (a) a cache
              miss might delay  a processor for fewer than ten  instructions; (b) a page
              fault for a few million  instructions; and (c) operating system pre-emption for
               hundreds of millions of instructions.  Coordination  protocols that do not
              take such delays into account run the  risk that if one processor is
              unexpectedly delayed, then the  remaining processes may be unable to make
              progress.  Such  problems become increasingly severe as systems scale.   In 
              the past few years, a number of researchers have developed a  range of new
              techniques, based on classical algebraic  topology, for analyzing distributed
              and concurrent protocols  and data structures.   These techniques have been
              applied  successfully, under the US-Mexico collaborative effort  supported by
              CCR-9505949, to a range of computational  problems.   This renewal
              collaborative project extends these  algebraic topological techniques to a
              range of more  difficult problems, not just for distributed and parallel 
              computing, but for any problem area that requires reasoning  about uncertainty
              and partial information.***
