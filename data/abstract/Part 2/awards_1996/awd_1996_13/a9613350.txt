Abstract    :
              9613350  Yoder      Nitrogen  is  one of the most important elements controlling
               plant  growth  in both natural and agricultural  ecosystems.  Ecophysiology 
              theory  suggests  that  the  distribution  of  nitrogen within a plant canopy
              should match the distribution  of  intercepted light; that is, there should  be
               much  more  nitrogen near the top of the canopy (where light levels  are 
              highest)   than in the more shaded areas near the bottom  of  the canopy. 
              However, when theoretical predictions have been  compared  with actual plant
              canopies, the results have  been  mixed  at best. Nitrogen distribution in most
              canopies  does  show   the same general pattern as that predicted by theory. 
              However,  the  mechanism by which nitrogen  content  changes  differs  between 
              species, and the  difference  in  nitrogen  levels from the top to the bottom
              of the canopy is rarely as  large as the theory predicts that it should be.   
              The  investigators have developed a hypothesis that explains  this  variation
              in mechanismsand also suggests some  reasons  why  the  variation  in nitrogen
              does  notalways  match  the  pattern  of light distribution, especially in
              older  leaves.  They  propose  to  test this hypothesis in  three  different 
              western    conifer   species:    Douglas-fir    (Pseudotsuga  menziesii), the
              most important timber species in the Pacific  Northwest; Pacific silver fir
              (Abies amabilis) an  important  tree  of  high altitude forests; and ponderosa 
              pine  (Pinus  ponderosa), the dominant tree in dry forests throughout  the 
              western United States.  If the hypothesis proves correct, it  will  provide  a 
              better  understanding  of  the  organizing  principles  for shoot structure and
              function within  complex  canopies,  and  will assist in efforts  to  "scale 
              up"  gas  fluxes  from  leaves  to canopies--a critical  component  of 
              attempts  to model and predict the consequences  of  climate  change in western
              conifer forests.
