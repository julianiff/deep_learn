Abstract    :
              Rothstein  9613363  A mesoscale ocean data assimilation will be developed for 
              the Coupled Ocean  Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) of the Tropical Ocean
               Global  Atmosphere (TOGA) program to produce a dynamically  consistent atlas
              of  oceanic fields to be made available to all COARE  Investigators and then
              use this  atlas to investigate upper ocean physical processes in warm  pool of
              the western  tropical Pacific Ocean. In particular, the importance of  salinity
              advection within  the thermocline and the influence of the three-dimensional 
              circulation on mixed  layer evolution will be assessed. Finally, the evolution
              of  energetic sub-  mesoscale eddies during equatorial jet spin-down will 
              studied.
