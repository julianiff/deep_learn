Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at University of Florida acquire an
              electrospray ionization ion trap  mass spectrometer. This equipment will
              enhance research in a number of areas including the  following: (1) dynamic
              measurement of neuropeptides in vivo, (2) synthesis and characterization  of
              synthetic and biological peptides and proteins, (3) electroactive polymers and
              aquathermolysis,  (4) biocatalytic synthesis and biocatalytic conversion of
              aromatic wastes into useful compounds,  and (5) analogs oligonucleotides and
              nucleosides bearing non-standard bases and modified  bridging groups.     Mass
              spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and
              to obtain  the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic,bioorganic,
              and organometallic molecules.  The addition of the technique of electrospray
              extends the range of MS to proteins and nucleic  acid molecular weights far
              beyond any other technique. The use of electrospray ionization in  combination
              with high resolution provides the latest techniques available in mass
              spectrometry.  It affords the chemist one of the most powerful tools available
              for the characterization of  compounds. The acquisition of this capability in
              mass spectrometry is essential for the  prosecution of frontier research in
              many fields of chemistry.
