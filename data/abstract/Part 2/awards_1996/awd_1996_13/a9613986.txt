Abstract    :
                This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's 
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial 
              support for two years to upgrade an existing OC-3c network to OC-12c and 
              extend the network to other Georgia research institutions.  The existing 
              network connects the Georgia Center for Advanced Telecommunications  Technology
              (GCATT) with other parts of the Georgia Tech campus.  The other  Georgia higher
              education institutions involved are Georgia State  University, Clark-Atlanta
              University, and Emory University's Crawford Long  Hospital.  The upgraded
              network also will link to Peachnet, the University  System of Georgia's
              internet.  Advanced applications are concentrated in  three strategic areas: 
              environmental technologies, advanced  telecommunications, and biotechnology,
              including human genetics.
