Abstract    :
              The PI will perform collaborative observations of the Sun with the Russian RATAN
              600 and the Very Large Array (VLA) in the US.  He will combine the high spatial
              and temporal resolution of the VLA with the broad spectral coverage and
              accurate polarization data of RATAN one- or two-dimensional scans for
              information on the magnetic fields' structure and strength in the corona, as
              well as the temperature and electron density in different plasma structures. 
              He will also localize regions of thermal and nonthermal energy release with
              these combined data sets.  Finally, he will determine the three-dimensional
              temperature, density and magnetic structure of intense, slowly-varying coronal
              regions controlled by coronal magnetic fields and electric currents.  These
              developments will all provide new insights to the emission, heating and
              acceleration mechanisms of particles trapped within the magnetospheres of solar
              active regions.
