Abstract    :
              The PIs will use extensive measurements and numerical modeling to study the
              generation and evolution of spread-F irregularity and scintillation phenomena,
              and obtain a global semi-empirical equatorial electrodynamic and spread-F model
              with predictive capabilities.  Using Jicamarca incoherent radar, global
              ionosonde and satellite measurements the investigators will determine the
              initial electrodynamic conditions for spread-F.  Their radar data set will
              determine the height dependent ambient electrodynamic conditions immediately
              prior to the occurrence of spread-F, the location of the initial unstable
              layer, and its temporal and spatial evolution for different seasons and flux
              conditions.  Height gradients in the vertical and zonal plasma drifts in the
              bottomside and topside of the F layer may play important roles in the
              generation and evolution of equatorial spread-F.  Additionally, the PIs will
              use extensive ionosonde and satellite data to determine the role of meridional
              neutral winds and magnetic declination effects, and extend the model to
              different longitudinal sectors.  Finally, they will combine the Jicamarca radar
              drift model, the AE-E satellite model and ionosonde observations with the storm
              time electric field model at Utah State and the GTIM to obtain the first global
              equatorial electrodynamic and spread-F model.
