Abstract    :
              9613653  Shiffman    This award supports a one year collaborative research 
              project between Professor Bernard Shiffman of the Japan-US  Mathematics
              Institute (JAMI) of Johns Hopkins University in  Baltimore, Maryland and
              Professor Junjiro Noguchi of the  Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan.  The
              project will  focus on several complex variables, concentrating on the 
              subjects of meromorphic mappings and intrinsic metrics in  geometry.  The main
              focus will consist of a conference and  workshop that will provide lectures for
              students and talks  on current research by Japanese experts and resident 
              experts.  They will explore the relationship between  geometry of holomorphic
              mappings and the theory of complex  manifolds, by concentrating on the topics
              of Nevanlinna  theory, complex dynamics in several variables,  hyperbolicity,
              moduli of holomorphic mappings, and invariant  metrics.    This project would
              support part of the ongoing activities of  JAMI which has annually co-sponsored
              conferences with  visitors from Japan.  The three day workshop and four day 
              conference (held the same week) are expected to include 60-  70 participants. 
              Many of the participants will include  young investigators, post-doctoral
              researchers and graduate  students.  Results of these meetings should
              facilitate  interaction and collaboration between mathematicians working  on
              these related topics in the United States and Japan.  ***
