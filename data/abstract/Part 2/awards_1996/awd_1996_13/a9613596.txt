Abstract    :
              9613596  Ohman      The abundance and production rates of Calanus finmarchicus
              and  Pseudocalanus spp. have been observed to differ greatly between the 
              shallow well-mixed crest waters of Georges Bank and the deeper  waters of the
              northeast peak and the southern flank. This project  will investigate the
              hypothesis that differing physical processes  which control the advection of
              water and zooplankton from the Gulf  of Maine onto different regions of the
              bank during the winter, and  differences in growth and mortality patterns of
              the target copepod  species within the different regions of the bank, regulate
              the  population sizes they attain during the spring and early summer. As  part
              of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Studies, Phase 2  program this
              project will focus on  egg production, growth, and  mortality of Calanus
              finmarchicus and Pseudocalanus spp.. This  project  will determine:  (1) the
              recruitment of Calanus and  Pseudocalanus on Georges Bank during the
              winter/spring period, as  inferred from the distribution of nauplii and early
              copepodites  collected with pump samples during the broad scale surveys; (2)
              the  spatial, seasonal and interannual variation in egg production and  birth
              rates for the dominant copepod species; (3) the spatial,  seasonal and internal
              variations in egg viability, egg and naupliar  mortality rates, and naupliar
              development rates; and (4) whether  egg and naupliar mortality rates are
              correlated with abundances of  potential predators.  ***
