Abstract    :
              This study will develop empirical relations to determine the probability that
              solar wind events at L1 appear in a similar form at Earth.  The PI will look at
              correlation coefficients between plasma and magnetic field data at these two
              locations for various solar wind conditions to determine the reliability of L1
              predictions for various solar wind conditions.  In addition, he will look at
              specific features, such as pressure pulses and shocks, to see what percentage
              detected at L1 are observed at Earth and whether the strength of these features
              varies from L1 to Earth.  These empirical relations can then be incorporated
              into forecasting models to give a measure of the reliability of the
              predictions.
