Abstract    :
                This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of 
              NCRI's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers 
              K-12 education institutions (including vocational technical schools),  public
              libraries and museums.  It provides partial support for two years  for a
              wireless system to connect seven school buildings in the five rural 
              communities in the school district to the existing wireless connection to  the
              University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  An antenna is mounted on  top of a
              grain elevator to communicate with the schools.
