Abstract    :
                 9613759  Vigoreaux    The PI plans to study the indirect flight muscles of
              many small insects (bees, wasps and most bugs).  Projectin and flightin are
              among these indirect flight muscles that are characterized by their high power
              output required to sustain a fast wingbeat frequency necessary for flight.  The
              PI's laboratory has been studying flightin with the goal of understanding its
              function in the insect stretch-activated indirect flight muscle.  The PI will
              use molecular methods to further characterize this newly discovered protein and
              generate a genetic model.
