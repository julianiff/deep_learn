Abstract    :
              This research explores a set of techniques for robust logic synthesis tools to 
              support the design automation of high-performance and low-power sequential 
              synchronous circuits.  The approach is based on a new concept of logic timing, 
              which combines retiming with logic optimization across register boundaries into
               a single efficient optimization technique.  Also being explored is state
              encoding  for sequential synthesis of circuits specified as finite state
              machines.  The  model is based on a controlled reencoding/retiming of the
              symbolic representation  of the state machine represented initially with
              one-hot code.  This facilitates  a reliable estimation of circuit cost, such as
              delay, power, and sequential  testability, as a direct function of the
              encoding.  The proposed work is being  carried out in collaboration with
              Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. of Austin, TX.
