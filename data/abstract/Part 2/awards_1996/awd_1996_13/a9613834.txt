Abstract    :
              This grant will develop a computational model of the solar wind, capable of
              forecasting solar wind conditions based on remote observations of the Sun.  The
              PI will develop a comprehensive three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
              model capable of computing solutions for the solar wind from its genesis at the
              Sun to beyond Earth orbit.  Based on a robust MHD code already used in 3-D
              calculations of the corona and solar wind, this instrument has produced
              agreeable calculations with coronal and heliospheric observations.  Key
              improvements to the code will be inclusion of important dynamic and
              thermodynamic effects, including a transition region, radiation, thermal
              conduction, coronal heating and Alfven wave acceleration.  The project relates
              to implementing the 1-D formalism into a 3-D MHD model, and parameterizing the
              important effects via comparison to Helios, WIND, and Ulysses solar wind data. 
              The grant's end result:  a unique computational tool capable of predicting the
              evolving structure of the solar corona and inner heliosphere.
