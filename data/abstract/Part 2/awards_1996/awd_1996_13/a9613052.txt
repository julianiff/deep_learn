Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is developing conditions which will make   dimethyl
              carbonate an industrially viable alkylating agent for the   preparation of
              quaternary ammonium salts.  In a second part of the   project, the products of
              the alkylation reactions will be transformed   into a series of salts with
              varying counter ions. Thirdly,  several   biodegradable quaternary salts will
              be constructed as possible   alternatives to the environmentally less friendly
              salts now used in   commercial products.  The project will serve as platform
              for the    education of  undergraduate chemistry students. With this Technology
              for   a Sustained Environment award, the Synthetic Organic Program, as part of 
               the NSF/EPA Partnership, is supporting the research and educational  
              activities of Dr. Gary W. Earl of the Department of Chemistry at   Augustana
              College.  Professor Earl will focus his work on developing new   and viable
              methods for the production of quaternary ammonium compounds.    These compounds
              find wide industrial use as components of products as   diverse as fabric
              softeners to hair conditioning agents.  Undergraduate   chemistry majors will
              be exposed to the constraints of industrial   processing, both equipment and
              reaction conditions, as well as economic   limitations.
