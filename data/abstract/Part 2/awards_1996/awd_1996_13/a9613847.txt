Abstract    :
                                        Abstract  9613847  Ruohoniemi  This project will apply
              the capabilities of the existing  SuperDARN (Dual Auroral Radar Network) high
              frequency (HF)  radar pairs in the Arctic and Antarctic to the data needs of 
              the National Space Weather Program (NSWP).  These radars are  operated in large
              arrays in both polar regions by several  nations.  One of the principal ways in
              which solar activity  influences the Earth is through the effect of the solar
              wind  on the magnetosphere and the upper atmosphere.  The  SuperDARN radars
              measure the flow velocity of  ionospheric  structures in the upper atmosphere
              from which the driving  magnetospheric electric fields can be deduced, thus in
              its  present form the radars can provide important data for the  research
              component of the NSWP.  Additionally, the project  will implement real-time
              data links which will provide  alerts of sudden disturbances in the near-Earth
              space  environment.  ***
