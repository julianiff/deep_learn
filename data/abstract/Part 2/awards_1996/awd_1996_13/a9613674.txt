Abstract    :
              Nelson & Gaunt  96-13674  The Borror Laboratory of Bioacoustics (BLB) is a unit
              within the Department of Zoology of The Ohio State University, and is located
              in the College of Biological Sciences' Museum of Biological Diversity. The BLB
              houses one of the largest collections of recorded animal sounds in the world,
              containing approximately 23,200 recordings of over 1000 species of animals. A
              current catalog is available for browsing by Internet. The BLB is also a center
              of active research by faculty, staff, and students on animal sounds. This
              project will copy the entire collection to digital compact disc (CD-R), and
              restore and duplicate (if necessary) analog tapes of animal sounds; these
              copies will then be stored in the University archive.  Having the sounds in the
              new digital format will enable Internet transmission of the sounds, make
              possible the integration of audio and text data in a common file structure, and
              assist with rapid retrieval of requested sounds, as well as assuring permanence
              of the collection by enabling cloning of the data into newer digital formats as
              these become available. The OSU is partnering with the NSF in funding this
              project by purchasing a number of equipment items needed for the work being
              funded by this award.
