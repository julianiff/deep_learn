Abstract    :
              This starter grant award to Iowa State University supports the research   of
              Professor Valerie V. Sheares.  Research focusses on the synthesis and  
              characterization of new monomers, homopolymers, and block copolymers for   gas
              membrane applications.  The work examines the effect of various   morphologies
              on the gas transport properties of a material. The   utilization of living
              anionic polymerization and new aminoisoprene   monomers yields new block
              copolymers whose morphology can be   systematically varied.  Through study of
              morphologically varied products,   understanding is advanced of how polymer
              microstructure, chain motion,   free volume, density, and polarity affect the
              solubility, diffusivity,   and ultimately gas permeability properties of these
              new materials.  Through synthesis and study of novel gas permeable membranes,
              the   research advances understanding of the fundamental relationships between 
               the structure of a polymeric membrane and its resulting separation  
              properties.
