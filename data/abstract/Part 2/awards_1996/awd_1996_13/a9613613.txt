Abstract    :
                96-13613  Rambo  Influence of forest fragmentation on watershed functions in
              Northern Vietnam            Forest patches are rarely taken into consideration
              in rural  development programs. This project aims to assess the management of
              forest   fragments, as opposed to monolithic forest cover, as a valid new
              paradigm   for sound watershed conservation. The investigators will test linked
                hypotheses relating to the consequences of forest fragmentation on  
              watershed functions and socioeconomic forces and technological conditions  
              that foster forest fragmentation. The project, to be undertaken in northern  
              Vietnam, is expected to provide basic data for evaluating environmental  
              changes and management actions, and develop some of the indicators and   basic
              understanding necessary to manage ecosystems. Ecosystem experiments   are the
              most direct method available for improving predictions of   environmental
              response to management. This information is also urgently   needed for the
              design of policies and programs that balance the need for   watershed
              protection, forest conservation, and landscape restoration with   the demands
              for socioeconomic development.
