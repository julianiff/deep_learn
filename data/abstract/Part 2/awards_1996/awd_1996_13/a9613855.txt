Abstract    :
              The University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and the San Diego Supercomputer
              Center (SDSC) propose acquisition of the first commercial MTA system.     The
              salient features of the Tera MTA multiprocessors are:    -high-speed GaAs
              processors,  -its multi-threaded architecture (hence MTA), which should allow
              more concurrency and thus higher processor efficiency,  -an interconnection
              network scalable to hundreds of processors,   -shared memory with its
              convenient programming model and broad applicability,   -a sophisticated
              compiler for automatic parallelization.    This system will be made accessible
              to researchers and educators nationwide  for production computing and computer
              science experimentation.  In addition, local researchers will evaluate
              performance of the MTA a from both systems and applications perspectives.
