Abstract    :
              9613648  Vanderbilt  The proposed research program in this grant consists of (1)
               development of accurate, efficient and robust computational  algorithms
              capable of treating large system sizes needed for  a realistic computer
              modeling of materials and (2) to apply  these methods to study several
              important material systems,  especially oxides and their surfaces and
              interfaces.  The  primary computational tool will be plane-wave 
              pseudopotential approach to density-functional theory,  but  a tight-binding,
              linear-scaling method will also be used.  "Ultrasoft" pseudopotential methods
              will be used to study  the defect structures and electronic states at TiO2
              surfaces  and Si:SiO2 interfaces.  %%%  The research in this grant is partly to
              develop  sophisticated but fast ways of using computers to calculate 
              properties of  materials.  The principal applications are to  understand the
              structure of defects at surfaces and  interfaces in oxides.  An important long
              range goal is also  to understand the relationship between ferroelectricity and
               surface structure.  ***
