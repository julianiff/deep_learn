Abstract    :
              9613703  This NSF-CONACyT collaborative research project is on very  high level
              programming languages that will facilitate  flexible ways of problem as well as
              query specification.  The term "very high level" is used to mean a declarative
              (as  opposed to a conventional, procedural) language, in which  the emphasis is
              on what a program should compute rather than  on the details of how the
              computation should be carried out.  The focus of the research is on sets, which
              are central in  applications of database query languages and logical 
              specifications of problems.  While previous research has  laid the foundations
              for a set-oriented declarative  language, the new research will expand the
              paradigm with two  important capabilities: constraints and preferences. In this
               programming paradigm, a user can specify the mandatory  requirements (or
              constraints) of a problem and also the  optional requirements (or preferences)
              that guide the  search for optimal solutions. In considering how to  formulate
              preferences based upon aggregate values, the  research will examine how to
              integrate sets, constraints,  and preferences. The proposed research covers
              design and  implementation issues, as well as applications, and will be 
              carried out in collaboration with Professor Mauricio Osorio,  at the
              Universidad de las Americas, Puebla, Mexico.  ***
