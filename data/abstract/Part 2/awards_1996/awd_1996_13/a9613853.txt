Abstract    :
                  This project will prepare and deliver to the NSWP a value added  data set
              providing a summary characterization of the energetic  particle environment at
              geostationary orbit obtained from data from  1989 to the present.  A
              statistical data set containing 1-day and  1-year averages which covers the
              entire 1989 - present interval  from 4 geostationary space craft will be
              prepared.  Included will  be the mean flux values, the mode, maximum, minimum
              and standard  deviation of the fluxes (or fluences) over specific energy ranges
               and integration time constants.  In addition, spin averaged, 3-  minute time
              resolution data for the years 1990 - 1993 (near solar  maximum and on the
              declining phase of the solar cycle) will be  provided from three instruments
              from one geostationary craft.   Relevant ancillary data such as solar wind
              data, geomagnetic data,  etc. will be appended to the data sets.
