Abstract    :
                  Abstract  CTS-9613835  R. Lueptow  Northwestern University    Particle
              motion and concentration in the proximity of the cylindrical surface of a
              rotating filter separator will be investigated,  ond on this basis the
              anti-plugging mechanisms and filtration performance will be better evaluated. 
              Particle Tracking Velocimetry and video imaging will give information on the
              role of Taylor vortices and shear flow in reducing the pore plugging. 
              Microscopic and macroscopic modeling will provide the framework to scale-up the
              results.  The effects of particle density, size and concentration, as well as
              the influence of  the filter rotational speed, will be analyzed.  Critical
              parameters, such as the ratio between the particle and pore size for optimum
              performance, are expected to be determined.    The results will be useful for
              the design of rotating filter separators and scale-up of laboratory data, as
              well as for enhancement of filtration performance with particular relevance to
              bioengineering.
