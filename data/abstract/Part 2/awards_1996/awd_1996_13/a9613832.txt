Abstract    :
              This research will analyze hundreds of flare events already observed, as well as
              additional events yet to come as solar activity increases.  The flare work will
              measure plasma parameters such as electron spatial and energy distributions,
              magnetic field strength, and ambient density in single or multiple flare
              sources for a large number of events.  The PI will obtained improved snapshot
              images from both current and future burst data using a new spatial/spectral MEM
              algorithm, hence obtaining improved spectra from which to extract these
              physical parameters.  In addition, he will study active regions as they rotate
              across the disk, employing techniques such as stereoscopy and the
              spatial/spectral MEM reconstruction, potentially giving the height structure of
              stable active regions viewed from different aspect angles as the Sun rotates.
