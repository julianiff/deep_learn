Abstract    :
              Two groups, the Imaging Systems Laboratory (ISL) of the University of Colorado 
              and the Laboratorio de Optica, (LO) in the Departamento de Fisica y Matematicas
               of the Universidad de Los Americas, are pursuing a joint research program to 
              further develop and demonstrate tools for the design of integrated 
              optical/digital imaging systems.  This program combines the capabilities of the
               two groups and focuses their efforts by concentrating on the reduction of the 
              longitudinal region of focus of an imaging system.  That is, an optical/digital
               imaging system is to be designed that has a greatly reduced depth of field or,
               equivalently, a dramatically increased resolution along the longitudinal axis.
                Based on previous research by the two groups, it is believed that this goal
              can  be achieved without adversely affecting the transverse resolution. 
              Indeed, it  appears likely that, with a combined optical/digital system, the
              transverse  resolution can also be increased somewhat.  Such a system would be
              useful in  microscopy, medical imaging, and in inspection devices for
              manufacturing.    In addition to the scientific advances and potential new
              imaging systems, the  interaction between the graduate students in each group
              and long-term (one month  to one semester) visits to each others' institutions
              will greatly promote  international cooperation in the field, and understanding
              between the two  cultures.
