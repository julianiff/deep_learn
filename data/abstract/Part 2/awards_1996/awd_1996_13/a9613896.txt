Abstract    :
                Sullivan County Community College requests support from NSF to  acquire
              communications lines required to connect to the Internet.  SUNYNET, a midlevel
              network in the in the state of New York, will  provide operations management
              and information services and it  will give the campus access to the Internet, a
              collection of  interoperable networks that connect most research and education 
              organizations in the United States.    Sullivan County Community College needs
              the Internet connection  to be able to access information resources throughout
              the state,  the nation and the world.  The connection will benefit the 
              faculty, staff students of this institution as well as the  community in
              general.
