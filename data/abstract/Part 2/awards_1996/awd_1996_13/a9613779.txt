              Abstract  ATM96-13779  Weare, Bryan C.   University of California, Davis  Title:
              Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Mesoscale Model Studies of Short-term Climatic 
              Variations in the Equatorial Pacific    This grant is to support a modeling and
              data analysis  effort to better understand the   physical processes responsible
              for the climate and the short term climate change over  the tropical oceans. 
              This work brings to bear three major modeling components.  The  focus is on the
              multiscale interactions.     Diagnostic studies of the results from the models
              will provide extremely useful  information as to the nature of the initiation, 
              development,  and propagation of the  tropical phenomena,  Madden -Julian
              Oscillation (MJO) and the El Nino Southern  Oscillation (ENSO).  These studies
              will be important in gaining a better understanding  of the role of the Western
              Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) and the equatorial oceans as a  whole in climate and
              climate variability.
