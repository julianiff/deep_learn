Abstract    :
              9613746  Chang        Under this award, Drs. Chang and Chen will carry out an 
              observational study of the spatial and temporal variability of the  East Asian
              monsoon, focusing on its interannual-scale interactions  with the South Asian
              monsoon and the relationship to the tropical  biennial oscillation.  The
              principal approach will be to use  statistical methods, including composite and
              principal component  techniques and a technique developed by the principal
              investigators  called multiple-set canonical correlation analysis, to analyze 
              long-term data sets (reanalysis products, climate rainfall data,  and out-going
              longwave radiation data sets, among others).  The  monsoon systems will be
              described in terms of their rainfall  characteristics as well as their wind and
              pressure patterns.           The Asian monsoon system(s) is a major signal in
              the general  circulation and the global climate.  Better understanding of its 
              role in the global system is essential to improving both weather  and climate
              prediction, even in remote regions such as over the  United States.  The
              Large-scale Dynamic Meteorology and Climate  Dynamics Programs will share in
              the support of this project.  ***
