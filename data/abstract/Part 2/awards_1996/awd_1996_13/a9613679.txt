Abstract    :
              Helsdon/Abstract           The objectives of this research are charge separation
              process  in the influence of lightning on the electrical structure and 
              development of thunderclouds, primarily using the 3D storm  electrification
              model.  With respect to charging processes we plan  to examine the convective
              hypothesis, acting alone, to see if it is  capable of producing strong
              electrification within storms;   continue to investigate noninductive charging
              processes based on  the most recent laboratory findings;  look at the
              hail/cloud water  inductive mechanism to determine its importance in the 
              electrification during the mature stage of storms;  and examine  several
              mechanisms, including splashing of hail and supercooled  liquid water, to
              investigate the production of charge structures  that might favor positive
              cloud-to-ground lightning.  We also plan  to incorporate electrical effects on
              the vertical and horizontal  motion of charged hydrometeors as well as the
              calculation of  detailed hydrometeor charge budgets.         With respect to
              the lightning scheme, we will develop a more  randomized propagation for the
              simulated channel, incorporating the  electric field due to the channel itself.
               We will continue to  investigate the termination criterion, with the intent of
              solving  the problem of channel propagation to ground.  Finally, we plan to 
              run simulations with multiple discharges to determine their  influence on the
              charge rearrangement during the active lightning  phase of storms.
