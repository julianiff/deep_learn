Abstract    :
               Abstract - Enrique Iglesia CTS-9613632   Environmental impact during processing
              of fuels and their precursors can be reduced via efficient utilization of
              hydrogen. This critical component of many petroleum processing operations is
              used nonselectively in reactions such as isomerization (those that involve
              hydrogen-transfer steps), dehydrocyclization, desulfurization and
              hydrotreatment in general. A limit to the selectivity of current catalysts used
              for those reactions is the insufficient knowledge about  catalytic sites
              requirements. This proposal formulates a study  of cationic sites exchanged
              into pentasil zeolites, in terms of structure, spectroscopy, and catalytic
              reactions, as means of characterization. The author has produced related work
              in recent projects, and successfully demonstrated the use of the techniques to
              be exploited in this project. The structure of exchanged cations will be
              determined by X ray absorption spectroscopy. The H-transfer and disposal by
              those sites will be examined using kinetic and H-D exchange reactions and
              in-situ infrared spectroscopy. Coupled dehydrogenation-hydrogenation reactions
              will be enhanced by addition of hydrogen scavengers such as O2, CO2, CnHx,
              etc., and the role that such coupling has on alkane dehydrogenation selectivity
              will be determined. Sulfur-containing compounds will be explored as hydrogen
              acceptors for activation of alkanes, and the hypothesis will be tested that
              more efficient hydrodesulfurization of such compounds is possible by means of
              coupled hydrogen transfer. Infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed thiophenic
              compounds on Lewis acid sites in ZSM5 in the presence of light alkanes or H2,
              isotopic exchange and chemical test reactions with sulfur-containing molecules
              will also be part of this study.
