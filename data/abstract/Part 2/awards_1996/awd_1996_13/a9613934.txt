Abstract    :
              9613934  Webster       The objective of the project is to maintain a database 
              of UNOLS and FOFCC research ship schedules and ship  characteristics.  The
              database provides a comprehensive up-  to-date and searchable listing of the
              national and  international research ships, the ship schedules and vessel 
              characteristics that are used in optimizing the scheduling  and planning of
              research time  by the ship operators and  research scientists.  The information
              is accessed through a  variety of ways, including the World Wide Web and
              Gopher.       As a result of the up-to-date information provided  through
              OCEANIC the US Naval Oceanographic Office no longer  prints ship schedule
              information and acknowledges that the  database provides more current
              information than their  previous publication.  OCEANIC  continues to develop 
              electronic scheduling procedures that provides the user with  current
              information and access to the world oceanographic  fleet.  ***
