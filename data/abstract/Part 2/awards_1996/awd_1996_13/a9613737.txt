                  This award, under the NSF-CONACyT initiative, funds a  collaboration with
              researchers at the Centro de Investigacion  Cientifica y de Educacion Superior
              de Ensenada (CICESE) in  Ensenada, Mexico.  The goal of the collaboration is to
              combine  expanded research in visual servo control of robotic manipulators  at
              the University of Illinois with research on dynamics and  control at CICSE.
              This should enable consideration of robot  dynamics in the design and
              evaluation of visual servo  controllers, thereby yielding active visual systems
              of more  robust design.  The research, which has previously focused on 
              geometric aspects, will be expanded to include the system  dynamics.  The
              research at CICSE will develop a framework for  evaluating a class of visual
              servo controllers and will also  yield a basis for performing rigorous
              stability analyses.  This  should lead to new capabilities for engineering
              robotic systems  in which the camera placement and the robot configuration for 
              manipulability can be optimized simultaneously. That could expand  the range of
              potential applications of visual servoing,  especially to situations involving
              moving obstacles and target  objects that are moving in the scene.
