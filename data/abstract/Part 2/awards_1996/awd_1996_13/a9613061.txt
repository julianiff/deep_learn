Abstract    :
              9613061  Binaut    This contract provides technical and administrative support
              for processing proposals received in the Division of Environmental Biology's
              Water and Watersheds Grant Competition.  Supported activities include initial
              data-entry, panel send-out, and decline data-entry/jacket preparation for
              proposals received by the 7 May 1996 deadline.  Initial data entry will include
              assembly of file jackets, entry of data into the NSF mainframe computer, and
              mailing of acknowledgment cards and attachments.  Panel send-out will include
              mailing of appropriate proposals, review forms, panel information, and other
              pertinent documents to panelists.  Decline data-entry/jacket preparation will
              include entering decline data into the NSF computer, generating decline
              letters/labels, and assembling decline jackets and PI-packages.
