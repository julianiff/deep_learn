Abstract    :
              The PIs plan to (1) complete the November 1993 space weather study, (2) continue
              geomagnetic storm analysis using the Assimilative Mapping Ionospheric
              Electrodynamics (AMIE), and (2) improve the conductance and field-aligned
              current mapping within the AMIE procedure.  Completing the 1993 data study will
              provide a first in-depth look at ionospheric and magnetospheric response to
              forcing by a combination of transient and recurrent phenomena in the solar
              wind.  Emphasizing four coronal mass ejection events, the PI will continue her
              support of the solar-terrestrial community at large.  Finally, improving
              parameters within the AMIE procedure will provide important information about
              the physical ties between the ionosphere and magnetosphere.
