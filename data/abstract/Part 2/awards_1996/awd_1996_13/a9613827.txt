Abstract    :
              CTS-9613827  YANG    This grant will provide funds for travel grant awards to
              U.S. authors of papers accepted for presentation and U.S. plenary lecturers at
              the Second Joint USA/China Chemical Engineering Conference to be held in
              Beijing, China on May 29, 1997.  The First Joint Conference was held in 1982,
              also in Beijing.  This was a highly successful conference that served as a
              "door-opening" meeting to Chinese chemical engineering by the U.S. delegation. 
              The Second Joint Conference will serve as an ideal forum for U.S. opportunities
              for cooperation.  As in the First Conference, the AIChE and its Chinese
              counterpart, Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China (CIESC), will
              be sponsors of the Conference.  In addition, the counterpart chemical
              engineering societies of Germany, Japan and Korea will join as co-sponsors,
              thus expanding the scope and impact of the Conference.  The Second Conference
              will be the largest formal international conference in Chemical Engineering. 
              The proposed budget of $25,000 will provide for 20-25 partial travel grant
              awards to U.S. authors of papers and invited plenary lecturers at the
              Conference.  Travel awards will be made based on the following considerations: 
              (1) scientific or technological merit of the paper; (2) availability of other
              sources of travel funding; (3) professional qualifications relative to age and
              position; (4) institutional and geographical distribution.  All awards will be
              made in full compliance with the Civil Rights Acts of 1964.  NSF travel
              policies with respect to U.S. air carriers will be followed.  ***
