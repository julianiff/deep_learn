Abstract    :
              9613111  Komanduri  The use of cutting fluid in machining has been the standard
              practice in metal working inudustry.  Recent environmental constraints
              necessitate innovations on dry machining or other techniques.  The research
              project is to develop novel nanocoating technologies on cutting tools for dry
              machining.  This research project will conduct the following investigations: 
              (1) synthesize the characterize multilayer nanocoating systems on cemented
              tungsten carbide cutting tools by closed field unbalanced megnetron sputtering
              (CFUMS); (2) optimize the nanocoating architecture, thickness of the carbide
              layer, metal interlayer thickness and number of layers, and deposition
              conditions of CFUMS for a given application; (3) evaluate multilayer
              nanocoating systems in dry machining of selected work materials over a wide
              range of feeds, speeds, and depths of cut; (4) evaluate the performance of the
              nanocoating systems in dry machining and compare it with uncoated as well as
              candidate commercial coating systems; (5) determine the micromechanisms of tool
              wear and relate to the structure and composition of multilayer nanocoatings and
              (6) assess the payback of dry machining with numerous nanocoatings and identify
              new applications for nanocoatings as well as for dry machining of other
              materials.   This project is a collaboration between an industrial partner and
              the University.  The outcome of these studies could provide useful findings for
              the machining industry.
