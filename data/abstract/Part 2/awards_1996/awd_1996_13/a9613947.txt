Abstract    :
              The investigators will develop a data assimilation ionospheric model to be
              driven mainly by data obtained from the Global Positioning System (GPS).  This
              model will overcome limitations experienced in obtaining measurements through
              total electron content tomography, relying on the first principle dynamical
              equations governing the state of the ionosphere.  The main goals of the project
              are:  (1) developing a mid- and low-latitude data assimilation model based on
              an existing physics-based model, (2) using the total electron content data
              obtained from the continuously tracking ground network of GPS receivers as
              input to the model, (3) using the total electron content data obtained from a
              low-Earth orbiter tracking GPS as input to the model, (4) deriving a 3-D field
              of electron density, (5) evaluating the accuracy of the model by comparing to
              independent measurements, and (6) evaluating the predictive power of the model
              by comparing predicted measurements to actual ones.
