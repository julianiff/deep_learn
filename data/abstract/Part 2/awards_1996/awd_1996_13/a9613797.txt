Abstract    :
              This grant will design, build, test and analyze a unique and innovative
              computational tool for accurately predicting the occurrence of equatorial
              spread-F.  The tool will be based on an artificial neural system (ANS), or
              neural network.  These systems are unique in their ability to learn to
              characterize complex relationships using historical data.  The system will
              learn to interpret pre-sunset data from a DMSP satellite probe and various
              ground-based remote-sensing systems, and categorize these data to predict the
              likelihood of post-sunset equatorial spread-F.  Finally, once the ANS-based
              predictive tool has been developed, tested and validated, the nonlinear mapping
              the system has learned will be examined and contrasted with the analytical
              framework of plasma physics.
