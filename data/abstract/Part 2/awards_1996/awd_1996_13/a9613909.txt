Abstract    :
                    This award is made under the high performance connections portion of
              NCRI's  "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides
              partial support for a DS-3 ATM connection to the Very High Performance Backbone
              Network Service (vBNS) for the research institutions in the State of Ohio for
              two years.  It also upgrades an existing OC-3 network between these
              institutions to OC-12.  Among the applications are PhAROh Meta Center Regional
              Alliance projects, polar-global atmospheric interaction studies, Regional
              Training Center for Parallel Processing activities, and ATM  testbed research. 
              Collaborating sites could include the Cornell Theory Center, National Center
              for Atmospheric Research and North Carolina State University.
