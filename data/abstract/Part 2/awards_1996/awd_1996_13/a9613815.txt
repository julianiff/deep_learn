Abstract    :
                The objective of the project is to test how well a state-of-the-art  global
              MHD code does in simulating a suite of five generic space  weather conditions. 
              The five conditions are thoughtfully chosen  such that the simulations will
              also provide useful insights into  the physics behind the conditions.  While
              global MHD is the only  realistic large-scale modeling tool, its theoretical
              limitations  are well known, and such tests are needed to estimate the
              practical  predictive capability of such codes at present.
