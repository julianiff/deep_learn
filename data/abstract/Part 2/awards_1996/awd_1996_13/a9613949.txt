Abstract    :
                    Utah Valley State College requests support from NSF to connect  three
              Native American Community Colleges institutions of higher  education and one
              museum to the Internet.  These include:  Provo  College, Provo, UT, Northwest
              Indian college, Washington,  Institute of American Indian Arts, Santa Fe, NM,
              and Fort Peck  Community College, Poplar, Montana. This grant will be used to
              help  the institutions get access to the Internet.  Utah Valley State  College
              will be using Digital Wave Modulation and V+Chip Advanced  Television Decoding
              as a method of providing lower cost access to  the Internet and delivery of
              educational courses and programs.    These rural Native American institutions
              needs the Internet  connection to be able to access information resources
              throughout  the state, the nation and the world.  The connection will benefit 
              the faculty, staff students of these institutions as well as the  community in
              general.
