Abstract    :
              9630630  Goldstein  The kidney is the organ fundamentally responsible for
              regulation of water and salt balance in birds.  As in other vertebrate groups,
              these are regulated by a number of hormones.  Studies of whole animals have
              elucidated a basic picture of some of these mechanisms.  For regulation of
              water balance, the hormone arginine vasotocin (AVT, released from the pituitary
              gland of the brain) is primarily responsible for reducing urine flow. For
              regulating the balance of phosphate (a principle component of bone), the
              hormone parathyroid hormone (PTH, from the parathyroid glands in the neck) is
              primarily responsible for stimulating urinary excretion of phosphate.  Yet the
              sites of action of these hormones (or, in fact, of any hormone) within the
              avian kidney are unknown.  The avian kidney consists of thousands of individual
              functional units, the renal tubules.  Within each kidney are two major
              subclasses of tubule, and within each tubule are several differently
              specialized regions.  In the present studies, the PI will evaluate the specific
              site of aciton of AVT and PTH within the renal tubules.  Adequate regulation of
              water and phosphate excretion are of basic value to survival; disruptions in
              these processes can lead to a variety of pathologies (e.g., kidney stones, a
              common disease of poultry).  The present studies should lead to an improved
              understanding of the mechanisms which regulate these basic aspects of avian
              physiology.
