Abstract    :
              9630908  Drewes  During the past ten years, the California Academy of Sciences
              (CAS) and its Department of Herpetology have expanded their support of research
              and education within the scientific community. The Academy funds all levels of
              higher education (undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral). The increase in
              the number of CAS-funded programs has led to a concomitant increase in the
              number of visitors that utilize the facilities in the Herpetology Department.
              The current visitor space is adequate, but the equipment items in that space
              are inadequate for the number of visitors. This exceptional service award will
              upgrade the equipment available to visiting researchers.
