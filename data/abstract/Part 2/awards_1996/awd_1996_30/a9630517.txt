Abstract    :
              9630517  Vivian    The Arizona State Museum (ASM) will use this planning grant
              to  further their planning for the educational content of their new 
              prehistoric gallery.  This project is titled "Prehistoric Gallery:  Planning
              for Science Education Components".  The subject of the  planning activity is
              part of their master plan for facility  renovation and interpretation.  Two
              approx. 10,000 square foot  exhibit halls are being developed; the first is the
              recently opened  Paths of Life: American Indians of the Southwest.  The second,
              and  the subject of this planning project, is Journeys of the Ancestors: 
              Ancient Peoples of the Southwest.  The planning activities will  consist of 1)
              travel by the ASM planning committee to seven museums  to discuss exhibit
              philosophy, interpretive strategies, and exhibit  techniques; 2) an
              interpretive design seminar that will bring  together a multidisciplinary team
              of scientists, science educators,  exhibit designers, and others to share ideas
              on the design,  content, and educational activities for this new hall; 3) 
              additional a front-end evaluation to test effectiveness of the  themes,
              strategies, and learning activities with different segments  of their potential
              audience; 4) a planning session with area  teachers to examine the relationship
              between the exhibit and the  curricular needs.
