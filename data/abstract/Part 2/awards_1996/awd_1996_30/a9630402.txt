Abstract    :
              Ray   9630402  The integrity, as well as the diversity of chromosomes, is
              maintained by recombination and yet little is known about how this mechanism is
              judiciously performed, particularly in plants. A system of induced mitotic
              recombination in Arabidopsis thaliana, in which a single, defined, DNA double
              strand break is delivered to the chromosome at a particular locus has been
              developed. The target site of a site-specific DNA endonuclease, HO endonuclease
              of yeast, is cloned into a unique chromosomal location and the break induced by
              the expression of a cloned HO gene in the plant. Specific objectives are 1) to
              test the hypothesis that a chromosomal double strand break in meiosis can
              induce homologous recombination in Arabidopsis and 2) to determine whether
              ectopic recombination can be stimulated in mitosis and meiosis by a DNA double
              strand break in the plant chromosome.  %%%  A better understanding of the basic
              mechanisms involved in recombination of plant chromosomes will result from this
              study using the model plant, Arabidopsis thalania. Moreover, any movement
              toward the goal of achieving site-specific recombination in plants will have
              significant impact in both basic and applied research.
