Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT  OPP-9630019  Koester/Alland/Kramer      The object of the
              dissertation project in anthropology is to investigate the role of native art
              in cultural identity and revival among the Bella Coola, or Nuxalk, people of
              British Columbia. For the Nuxalk, art is process and a culture-constructing
              event, as well as an end product. Contemporary Nuxalt art can be interpreted as
              a manifestation of the current struggles surrounding Nuxalt identity. Art will
              be studied from the perspective of its producers as well as its Native
              consumers. This study, which will employ participant-observation and open-ended
              interviews, relates to issues of object and knowledge appropriation and
              repatriation.
