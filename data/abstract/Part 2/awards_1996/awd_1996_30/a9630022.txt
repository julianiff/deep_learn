Abstract    :
              The hybrid automaton is a promising model for studying the  behavior of hybrid
              systems. One drawback of this model is  the difficulty in deriving decidable or
              semidecidable  procedures. The suspension automaton is a subclass of linear 
              hybrid automata for which decidable language containment  procedures exist. The
              objective of this project is to  investigate  the use of  suspension automaton
              to accurately  model and verify real-time systems. Due to the complexity of 
              these problems, a methodical way to study them is called  for, such as would be
              provided by a software tool.  This project is designed to explore the issues
              involved in  building an implementation of verification techniques based  on
              the suspension automaton. Two specific issues must be  addressed.  First, the
              relation of this work to existing  work, particularly in the area of real-time
              systems, must be  established. Second, a specific approach to building such a 
              tool must be formulated. Both of these goals may be aided by  establishing
              contact with researchers in the real-time area,  particularly those who are
              have produced software tools to  study real-time systems.  ***
