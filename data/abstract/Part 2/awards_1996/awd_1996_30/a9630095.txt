Abstract    :
              9630095  Sollitt  The objectives of the project are to make breakaway walls, 
              used in coastal areas subjected to the wind and wave actions  of hurricanes,
              predictable, safer and functional.  This work  will improve the understanding
              of load-wall-structure  interactions and the results will minimize
              uncertainties in  wall design and construction.  Four tasks were identified to 
              accomplish these objectives and they are: first, to  determine the behavior and
              capacity of wall panels and  connections; second, to predict the response of
              parent  structure to environmental loads transmitted by wall  connections;
              third, to improve the ability to quantify  environmental loads acting on
              breakaway walls as well as the  response and modes of failure of walls
              interacting with  these extreme loads; and fourth, to improve the design and 
              construction processes of breakaway walls by incorporating  knowledge garnered
              in the three previous tasks and by  validating the models developed with these
              experimental  results.  The first two tasks are currently underway at  North
              Carolina State University (NCSU).  The third task will  be undertaken under the
              present project, and the last task  will incorporate the results of the first
              three tasks and  will be conducted at NCSU.  ***
