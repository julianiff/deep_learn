Abstract    :
              Bishop  9630739    This is an award the objective of which is to determine the 
              feasibility of using regenerated activated carbon, catalyst-  impregnated
              activated carbon and Portland cement to solidify and  stabilize contaminated
              soils and hazardous wastes containing  potential environmental contaminants. 
              The regenerated carbon is  derived from processes to remove contaminants from
              water but  which has become unsuitable for reuse in the process from which  it
              has been derived.  The research involves determination of the  extent to which
              the solidification process results in the  immobilization of the contaminants. 
              The proposal leading to this  award was submitted under guidelines contained in
              NSF 95-111,  Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison With Industry.  The 
              industrial partners in conduct of this project are the Calgon  Corporation and
              E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company.    Results of this project are expected to
              provide the engineering  design basis for use of spent activated carbon that
              can no longer  be sufficiently reactivated for reuse in the process from which 
              they were derived to adsorb and immobilize contaminants in  sludges and soil. 
              The use of spent activated carbon in this  process provides a potential use for
              a large quantities of spent  activated carbon that would otherwise be managed
              by incineration  or placement in secure repositories for hazardous substances.
