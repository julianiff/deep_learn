Abstract    :
                   This grant funds dissertation research on the syntax of  certain dialects
              spoken in Northern Italy. By field work in  Italy, the student will collect
              data on several different verb  types. The main dialect of interest is
              Borgomanerese, spoken in  the province of Piedmont. In this dialect certain
              intransitive  verbs which share similar meanings have distinct syntactic 
              properties which distinguish them from all other verbs. These  properties have
              gone previously unnoticed because Borgomanerese  is a very little studied
              dialect. The special properties that  this distinct class of verbs shares are
              of interest to  linguistics because they constitute evidence in favor of the 
              hypothesis, motivated by facts from other languages, which claims  that certain
              aspects of verb meaning are relevant to syntactic  structure.
