Abstract    :
                Abstract    This award supports a collaborative program to enhance education
              in nondestructive evaluation/nondestructive testing (NDE/NDT) that builds upon
              prior work by the Center for Nondestructive Evaluation, College of Engineering,
              Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at Iowa State
              University and selected community and technical colleges.  Students and
              instructors in two year NDT/NDE programs at Cowley County Community College
              (Kansas), Hutchinson Technical College (Minnesota), Moraine Valley Community
              College (Illinois), Northeast Iowa Community College, and Southeast Community
              College (Nebraska) will be eligible for competitive selection into structured
              summer and transfer programs at Iowa State University.  Two primary thrusts of
              this program are: 1) Enhance and encourage transfer of two year NDE/NDT program
              students to Iowa State University engineering programs. 2) Provide professional
              development opportunities for community/technical college NDE/NDT instructors
              that are aimed at upgrading technical and educational skills of the instructors
              and improving articulation from the two year NDE/NDT programs to undergraduate
              engineering programs at ISU and elsewhere.
