              Chan    This  research  will  explore the effects of  disorder  on  phase 
              transitions, particularly the superfluid transition  in  Helium-4  and  phase 
              separation  in Helium-3/Helium-4  mixtures.  This  is  accomplished by
              introducing liquid Helium-4 and Helium-3/Helium-4  mixtures  into  porous
              media, such as silica  aerogel  or  porous  gold,  two  substrates made by the
              investigator. In  this  random  environment  of  the porous media, the
              superfluid  transition  of  confined  pure Helium-4 was found to be completely 
              altered  from  the  bulk liquid although the transition remains remarkably
              sharp  and  exhibits well defined simple power law behavior.  The  power  law 
              exponents are significantly modified even though the  silica  based aerogel
              constitutes only a few percent of the total volume.  When  Helium-3/Helium-4
              mixtures are added  to  the  aerogel  the  phase  diagram of Helium-3/Helium-4
              mixture is completely altered  giving  rise to a new Helium-3 rich superfluid
              phase in  addition  to  the  usual  Helium-3 rich superfluid. The phase 
              diagram  and  behavior  of mixtures when the volume fraction of the aerogel  is
               further reduced will be studied.  %%%  In  the last two decades, a great deal
              has been learned about how  one  phase  of pure matter transforms into another,
              e.g.,  liquid  into  gas  and  superconductor into normal metal.   In  the 
              real  world,  disorder and impurities are very often present  in  these 
              systems. This project will provide an understanding of the effect  of such
              impurities on the nature of a specific system, namely the  transformation  of 
              liquid Helium-4 from the  superfluid  to  the  normal  state.  This system can
              be carefully controlled  so  that  conclusions   can   be   applied  to 
              technologically   important  materials. Impurities are introduced by adding
              liquid helium into  porous aerogel or porous gold of well characterized
              porosity  and  topology. Experiments to date  reveal unexpected results
              including  an   extraordinary  sharp  transition  inspite  of   the   random 
              environment and the creation of a new 3He rich superfluid  phase.  Study  is 
              planned of this unusual behavior and the variation  of  these properties with
              temperature, pressure and concentration  of  the two helium isotopes.  ***
