Abstract    :
                   The primary visual cortex of the brain, also known as area V1, is the first
              major cortical target for the nerve fibers in the visual pathway.  It has been
              considered classically to function mainly for analyzing features in the visual
              world considered to be "local" characteristics of pieces of objects, such as
              spatial orientations and locally contrasting parts of objects.  We now know
              that it also is involved in much more complex perceptual tasks such as
              completion of contours around whole objects, for context-dependent perception
              of visual attributes, and for some of the experience-dependent changes in
              perceptual performance.  Some of these properties are mediated by recently
              discovered long-range lateral connections of single cells within V1.  This
              project utilizes new methods of optical imaging of neural activity, along with
              physiology, pharmacology and anatomy, to study responses to visual stimuli
              containing multiple local elements that form more "global" visual features. 
              Functional properties of these horizontal interactions intrinsic to V1 are
              compared to the contributions of feedback connections to and from higher order
              cortical areas, particularly examining the relative roles of facilitation and
              inhibition.     Results from this work will lead to a better understanding of
              the early stages of visual processing in visual cortex, and also be relevant to
              understanding how cortical architecture relates to cortical function in
              general, which remains a fundamental issue in understanding the brain itself.
