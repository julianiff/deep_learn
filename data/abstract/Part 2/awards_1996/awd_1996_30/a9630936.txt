Abstract    :
                9630936  CHAIT  This project will facilitate the use of mass spectrometry in 
              biology and protein chemistry by developing a national  relational database for
              the mass spectra of proteins. The  database, named "MassBank", will include the
              mass spectra of  intact proteins, peptides generated by enzymatic digestion  of
              proteins, and ion products produced by mass spectrometric  fragmentation of
              peptides. The mass spectra (both published  and unpublished) will be submitted
              by researchers in the  mass spectrometric and biological communities. Tools
              will be  provided to search and analyze the mass spectra in the  database and
              to identify proteins using mass spectral data,  and to obtain all available
              information about any given  protein or its corresponding gene.    To enhance
              the utility of the database, a wide range of  information about proteins from
              other databases will be made  easily available during the process of
              examination of the  mass spectral data. This information will include amino
              acid  sequences, post-translational modifications, three  dimensional
              structures, literature references, and positions  on two-dimensional gels. 
              Tools will be provided to analyze  the primary structure of proteins with
              reference to the mass  spectra in the database.  The database will be publicly 
              accessible through a World Wide Web server.  All  submissions, searches, and
              analysis of mass spectra will be  done by filling out Hyper Text Markup
              Language forms.  The  introduction of this new database will greatly facilitate
               the identification and characterization of mature gene  products -- and hence
              provide an important tool for  biologists and protein chemists.
