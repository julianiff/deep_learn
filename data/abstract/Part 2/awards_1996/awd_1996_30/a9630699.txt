Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with  problems inherent in the informal specification
              of design. Its task is to develop a domain independent, generic knowledge-based
              requirement elicitation tool for design, called DDSC (Dynamic Design
              Specification with Chunking). Capturing design requirements is usually the task
              of knowledge engineers and is often done by post hoc knowledge acquisition,
              which in general is inadequate and difficult. In this approach however, design
              specification is a dynamic process evolving interactively. The elicitation
              process is based on the structure of human cognition through the use of
              recognized cognitive categories. DDSC takes as input an initial, informal
              requirement specification for a design object, as well as an extended  generic
              ontology of the design process, and generates a complete, unambiguous,
              consistent, and implementable requirement specification of the desired design
              object. It does so by ewalkingn the Designer and the User Agents through the
              design process. During this ewalk-through,n requirements are chunked down with
              the help of Chunking Agents into implementable bits.  DDSC is a participatory
              design tool which differs from any existing generic  tool. Its application will
              greatly contribute to minimizing the huge gap which exists between informal
              specification and design implementation.
