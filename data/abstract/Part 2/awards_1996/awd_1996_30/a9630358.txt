Abstract    :
              9630358  Dooner  The meiotic recombination process in maize will be further
              investigated with the use of the large collection of mutants which have a
              defect in the bronze (bz) gene. That gene affects seed pigmentation and is at
              least 100 times more recombinogenic than the average DNA segment in maize, so
              that many intragenic recombinants can be generated for analysis. The meiotic
              recombination process in maize will be investigated by 1) determining the
              continuity and average length of conversion tracts for the bz region in a
              constant genetic background, 2) determining the relationship between genetic
              and physical distance outside of the bz gene, correlating it with the
              repetitive vs. the unique nature of the flanking DNA and comparing it with the
              relationship already determined inside of the bz locus, 3) refining the
              relationship between genetic and physical distance within bz, 4) further
              analyzing the suppressing effect of insertions on intragenic as well as
              intergenic, recombination and determine the extant to which single base pair
              heterologies affect recombination and 5) examining the fidelity of the
              recombination process in maize.  %%%  Meiotic recombination is a fundamental
              genetic process and can serve to create novel genotypes in sexually reproducing
              organisms. Yet, in spite of its importance, little work has been done to
              elucidate the process of meiotic recombination in plants. This work will make
              important contributions to that small storehouse of knowledge in this area.
