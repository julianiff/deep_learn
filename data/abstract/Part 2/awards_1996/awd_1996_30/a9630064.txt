Abstract    :
              9630064  Fisher  This grant continues the support of this well respected PI  in
              several aspects of statistical physics.  The PI has made  significant
              contributions to the class of problems involving  interplay between quenched
              randomness and thermal and  quantum fluctuations.  The current focus is on
              random  quantum magnets, topological vortices in dirty type II  superconductors
              and spin glasses.  Another aspect of this  grant explores nonlinearly driven
              systems which have  threshold effects and respond at many spatial and temporal 
              scales.  The examples are dynamics of fracture in solids,  friction, motion of
              geological faults, dielectric breakdown  and critical currents in
              superconductors.  Finally there is  one project involving the recently
              developed dynamic mean  field theories (the infinite dimension limit) and their
               applications to the problem of strongly interacting  electrons.  %%%  This
              grant continues the work on a broad range of  problems,  related by certain
              underlying mathematical similarities.  One class of problems include the 
              motion of geological  faults, dynamics of fracture in solids, dielectric
              breakdown  and properties of distribution of intense current in a 
              superconductor.  In another class of problems, there are  random quantum
              magnets, propagation of magnetic vortices in  a superconductor etc.  These
              problems are noted for their  complexity, novelty and a broad range of
              applications.  ***
