Abstract    :
              9630572  Morel    The dynamic relationship between the trace metal chemistry and
               microbiology of terrestrial and marine surface waters will be  explored in
              this study. The principal investigator will conduct  both field and laboratory
              studies to determine how two trace  metals, copper and cadmium, are taken up by
              marine and freshwater  phytoplankton and bacterioplankton, bound to
              biochelators, and  released back into the water. The field work will be carried
              out in  coastal salt ponds on Cape Cod and in Swiss alpine lakes where  other
              scientists already have established programs to study trace  metal
              biogeochemistry. Laboratory experimentation will help  quantify the rates of
              these various processes. Besides improving  current understanding of the role
              of plankton biochemical pathways  impacting the trace metal chemistry of
              surface waters, these  studies should also provide insight into how metal
              concentrations  and chemical speciation are related in a two-way
              cause-and-effect  relationship to planktonic species composition.
