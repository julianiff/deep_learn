Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9630917  Luke Achenie    New Solvents are developed in response to
              one or more of the following:  (i) a desire for  better performance or reduced
              cost, (ii) the presence of a new process (iii) change in federal and state
              environmental regulations and (iv) safety and health considerations.   
              Developing new solvents with improved properties is, in general, a very time
              consuming and expensive process involving a combination of heuristics and
              costly experimental studies.  In these trial and error approaches, different
              solvents are synthesized, their physical and/or chemical properties are
              measured or inferred and compared with the desire properties for that
              application.    This proposal deals with initiating a systems research approach
              into finding a systematic framework for designing cleaning solvents for the
              printing industry.  This frame work simultaneously takes into consideration
              process performance and economics as well as health, safety and environmental
              targets.  An "optimal" blanket wash (cleaning solvent for the printing press)
              designed through a systematic procedure can result in significant energy
              savings as well as minimal environmental impact.  ***
