Abstract    :
              Oswald  9630777    Information in the brain is transmitted from one nerve cell
              to  another by the release of a messenger molecule from the presynaptic  cell
              which diffuses across the small space and interacts with a  protein imbedded in
              the membrane of the postsynaptic cell called a  receptor.  Glutamate is the
              most prevalent excitatory  neurotransmitter in the brain.  The receptors for
              glutamate bind  the amino acid, and respond by opening a channel between the 
              outside of the cell and the inside of the cell allowing positively  charged
              ions to flow across the cell membrane.  Dr. Oswald is  characterizing the
              topology of the glutamate receptor and has found  the receptors to be similar
              in structure to bacterial proteins  which have similar functions.  The
              evolution of these molecules  could help understand the mechanisms cells use to
              communicate.   Studies are continuing to understand the mechanisms of glutamate
               binding to this receptor.  These investigations will yield novel  data on the
              structure and function of glutamate receptors in the  brain and are important
              to understand adaptive mechanisms that have  been borrowed from simple
              organisms for use in higher species  during evolution.  In addition, these
              studies may provide the first  information about the molecular basis for
              learning and memory.
