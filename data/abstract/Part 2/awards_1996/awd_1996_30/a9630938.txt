Abstract    :
              The molecular machinery underlying development is remarkably similar among
              animals, and this provides a powerful tool for suqqesting body part homologies
              between distantly related animals.  Dr. Holland comparing vertebrates with the
              cephalochordate, amphioxus-which, in many ways, approximates the invertebrate
              body plan from which the vertebrates evolved.  Developmental genes of amphioxus
              are isolated and identified on the basis of sequence similarities with
              homologous genes of other animals, and the expression domains of these genes
              are used as phenotypic characters to indicate body part homologies. Hox genes
              and Engrailed gene are establishing the limits of the amphioxus hindbrain, and
              several genes (e.g. Wnts, Distal-less, PAX7, and NK2) are being used to map the
              regions of the amphioxus forebrain and midbrain.  A similar rationale underlies
              comparison between vertebrate eyes and amphioxus photoreceptors (Pax6), between
              vertebrate nephrons and amphioxus nephridia (Pax2), and between the vertebrate
              thyroid and the amphioxus endostyle (Pax8, TTFL).  In addition, developmental
              gene expression patterns after teratogen administration or microsurgery are
              identifying epigenetic networks common to vertebrates and amphioxus.
