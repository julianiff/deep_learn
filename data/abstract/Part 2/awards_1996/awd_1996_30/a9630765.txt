Abstract    :
              This project develops and tests new probabilistic approaches to text retrieval.
              Using the statistical  technique of logistic regression, documents are ranked
              in order of estimated probability of relevance  with respect to a query. The
              methods are subjected to rigorous performance experiments with the  collections
              of documents and queries of the TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) series of
              conferences  sponsored by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
              and DARPA (Defense Advanced  Research Projects Agency). Specifically the
              project investigates logistic regression retrieval in the  following areas: (1)
              comparison of different logistic regression retrieval models; (2) new
              theoretical  models which combine intelligent Boolean filtering with logistic
              regression; and (3) application of  the models to Chinese and Spanish language
              retrieval. This project will advance the progress in modern  text and document
              retrieval by developing sound theoretical models of the retrieval process,
              models  which achieve high performance in experimental tests on millions of
              documents. The research will  contribute to understanding of themechanisms of
              multilingual retrieval by applying its methodologies  to queries and document
              collections in Chinese and Spanish.
