Abstract    :
              U. of California, Los Angeles   Naturally occurring droughts are a chronic
              problem for agriculture and resource management in the Great Plains of the U.S.
              and Canada.  Attempts to predict potential drought severity are hampered by the
              short length of most climatic records from the plains.  The research proposed
              will utilize tree ring analysis to extract long term climatic records needed to
              establish baselines for assessing potential severity.  The research project
              will obtain tree rings from living trees and subfossil wood at a number of
              sites in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.  These sites when combined with
              existing sites in the U.S. will form a truly comprehensive tree ring network of
              the plains for the first time.  Tree ring chronologies based on ring widths and
              densities will be constructed for at least the last 500 years.  Relations
              between precipitation, ring widths and density will be examined and transfer
              functions developed to reconstruct regional records of drought for this period
              of time.  The resulting records will be analyzed to determine the comparative
              ability of latewood density as a predictor of precipitation, the severity of
              recent as opposed to older droughts, and drought occurrence patterns and
              periodicities in the northern plains.  The research is both theoretical and
              applied.
