Abstract    :
              9630498  Bekoff    The long-term goal of the project is to understand the 
              mechanisms underlying the ontogeny of coordinated motor  behavior.  The studies
              will focus on the role of sensory  experience in the development of behaviors
              involving leg  movements in embryonic and early postnatal life.  Both 
              electromyogram (EMG) and kinematic recordings will be  quantitatively analyzed
              to identify effects of altered  sensory input or later behavior.  Specifically
              the goal of  the research is to explore the issue of whether, in what  way, and
              to what extent alterations in sensory input produce  changes in the development
              of walking.  There are four  objectives.  The first is to examine the role of
              sensory  experience in the postnatal development of walking.  The  effect of
              removing or altering input due to load  (resistance) or joint proprioception,
              will be analyzed.  This set of experiments will also look at recovery from 
              deficits are limited to walking or whether they generalize  to other locomotor
              or non-locomotor behaviors.  A second  objective is to further  examine the
              role of sensory input  in mature locomotion.  The third objective is to examine
               similar issues in embryos.  This will help determine when  the mature
              responses to sensory stimuli develop and will  also examine how sensory input
              is involved in the embryonic  development of motor patterns.  Finally, the
              fourth  objective is to look  at the effects of skipping a step in a 
              developmental sequence.  The effects of eliminating  particular embryonic
              behaviors on the subsequent development  of walking will be evaluated.  Overall
              the data generated in  these studies will significantly increase our
              understanding  of the role of sensory experience in the development of  motor
              behaviors.
