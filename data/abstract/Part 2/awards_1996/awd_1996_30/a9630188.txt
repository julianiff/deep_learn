Abstract    :
                  The major component of the proposal is the development of methods  designed
              to substantially increase the range of biomolecular  systems to which advanced
              computational docking and design  methodologies can be applied. The most
              successful methods and  applications to date have been limited to proteins
              whose crystal  structures are known, and which remain relatively rigid during 
              complex formation. The main obstacle limiting the analysis of  more general
              systems in which side  chains and backbones change conformation is the target
              function.  The proposal therefore focuses on methods for obtaining accurate, 
              rapidly evaluatable semi-empirical free energy functions, with  particular
              emphasis on solvation. These include methods for  eliminating the time
              intensive surface area calculations required  by current semi-empirical free
              energy functions, as well as  several new approaches to solvation. Docking
              algorithms that can  take full advantage of free energy- target functions will
              also be  developed and tested in a variety of applications, exploiting the 
              extensive  crystallographic and thermodynamic databases available. Attention 
              will be given to the systematic comparison of currently available  and emerging
              semi-empirical free energy evaluation procedures,  including the delineation of
              their range of applicability.                    J
