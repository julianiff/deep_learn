Abstract    :
              9630091   Anderson   In this project, laboratory studies related to
              stratospheric ozone will be carried out. The focus will  be on two tasks: (1)
              an isotopic study of ozone production from the reaction between vibrationally
              excited and thermal oxygen molecules, and (2) the development of an
              ultra-sensitive diagnostic for detecting the absorption of light by ozone near
              the dissociation threshold.    For task (1), an apparatus will be constructed
              where mixtures containing ozone and isotopically labeled oxygen will be
              photolyzed. The products will be analyzed using mass spectrometry. The
              production of ozone through this channel has been hypothesized but as yet not
              demonstrated. If it occurs, it could constitute a significant source of ozone
              not currently included in stratospheric models.   In task (2), the feasibility
              of a photo-initiated chemiluminescence/ionization (PICL/I) diagnostic for the
              detection of weak ozone absorption in the near infrared will be investigated. A
              slow-flow photo-reactor will be constructed to mix ozone with selected reagent
              gases in the presence of near-IR radiation. Absorption by ozone will most
              likely yield dissociation to produce oxygen atoms, which in turn react with a
              reagent species to yield chemiluminescence or chemiionization. Detection of
              those emitted photons or ions will be exploited as a sensitive detector for
              ozone absorption.   If successfully developed, this technique will be used in
              the future to investigate the role of these low lying ozone states in oxygen
              atom/molecule recombination and other potentially important atmospheric
              processes.   ***
