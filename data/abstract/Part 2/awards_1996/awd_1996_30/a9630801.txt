Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9630801  Amon    This work is a fundamental investigation of heat
              transfer and flow phenomena in microcasting.  The spreading and solidification
              of molten metal droplets impinging on a surface will be modeled numerically and
              tested experimentally.  Remelting of the solid substrate by the impacting
              droplet, modeling of dissimilar materials with potential simultaneous melting
              fronts, and modeling the continuous droplet/substrate system conjugately will
              be addressed.  Spectral element direct numerical simulations of the governing
              thermo-fluid equations will be verified by experiments. Applications of this
              technology include manufacturing of multi-layer materials, artifacts with
              controlled microstructures, and artifacts with embedded electronic components.
