Abstract    :
              The main objective of this proposal is to develop an integrated approach for 
              increasing the dependability of parallel computers. For detection and diagnosis
               of hardware faults at the local (node) level, this approach will combine
              off-line  built-in self testing, on-line concurrent checking, and software
              techniques  implementing path and algorithmic-based checks.  The aim of this
              proposal is to  develop a systematic method for generating and placing checks
              into the  implementation of an application. For automating the verification
              process and  placement of checks in programs, an interactive tool, VERIFY, will
              be developed.  For estimating the coverage factor provided by these techniques,
              a software  fault-injection tool will be created.  Efficient and fast
              reconfiguration  algorithms will be developed for avoiding single and multiple
              faulty nodes and  links. A user transparent software layer will be created for
              implementing the  proposed algorithms.  This will be written on top of the
              existing system software  that residents in every node of parallel computing
              systems.    The Software Object-Oriented Fault-Injection Tool (SOFIT) will be
              ported on the  nCUBE and Tandem SeverNet. The recovery time overhead will be
              estimated in the  presence of single and multiple faults injected by SOFIT into
              the nodes and links  of the nCUBE and SeverNet when programs are being
              executed. A dependability  evaluation study will be performed.  The objective
              of this research is to show  that this integrated approach can be used
              successfully for improving the  reliability of the nCUBE and SeverNet by an
              order of magnitude.
