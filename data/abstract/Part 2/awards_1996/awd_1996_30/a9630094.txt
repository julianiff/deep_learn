Abstract    :
              The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program will   support
              research by Dr. Michael P. Castellani of the Chemistry   Department, Marshall
              University, on the reactivity of organometallic   radical compounds.  Electron
              deficient pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl   carbonyl compounds of Cr, Mo, and W
              will be synthesized and used to   prepare 17- and 19-electron species.  The
              relative stabilities of these   odd-electron species will be determined, as
              well as their physical   properties and reactivities.  In a related project,
              15-electron   nitromethane complexes of chromium  will be prepared and used to 
               investigate the isomerization of  nitromethane to methyl nitrite.  This  
              reaction will be studied to determine if it is general for nitroalkanes.   
              Also,  related alkoxide and amido chromium complexes will be prepared and  
              their reactivity with alkenes and alkynes explored.  Organometallic compounds
              that have 18 electrons in their outermost energy   levels are generally less
              reactive than those that contain 17 or 19   electrons.  Some 17- and 19-
              electron species are thought to be important   intermediates in catalytic
              reactions.  This project focuses on   understanding factors important in the
              reactivities of some odd-electron   species, especially in reactions which may
              have utility for organic   synthesis.  The research will be carried out by
              undergraduate students
