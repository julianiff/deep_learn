Abstract    :
              Dr. Judith Eglin, Department of Chemistry, Mississippi State University,   is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program   of the
              Chemistry Division under a Research Planning Grant to study the   synthesis and
              reactivity of tungsten complexes.  The reactivity of   multiply-bonded
              ditungsten and dimolybdenum complexes with chlorinated   hydrocarbons will be
              explored, with the ultimate goal of catalytic   dehalogenation.  Mononuclear
              tungsten complexes will also be investigated   for their potential as
              precursors to conducting materials.  These   planning activities will advance
              Dr. Eglin's career by providing a basis   for preparing a competitive NSF
              research proposal subsequent to the   completion of this Research Planning
              Grant.   The chemistry of tungsten and molybdenum is unique in that these
              metals   tend to form complexes in which two of these metals are bound to one  
              another through multiple bonds.  The reactivity of these compounds with  
              chlorinated hydrocarbons suggests their potential use in the   dehalogenation
              of these environmentally harmful molecules.  Futhermore,   the unique geometry
              of tungsten lends itself to the study of conducting   materials, which could
              have important industrial applications.
