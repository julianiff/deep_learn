Abstract    :
                   Taste remains a poorly understood sensory system by comparison to our
              knowledge of nerve activity patterns and pathways in the brain for other
              senses.  At all levels of the taste pathways from tongue to cortex, taste
              neurons generally are multi-sensitive, responding to some degree to more than
              one of the four basic taste qualities of salty, sour, bitter and sweet.  Little
              is known about the central organization of response profiles for taste cells,
              defined as their relative sensitivities across a variety of taste stimuli. 
              This project uses a novel approach combining electrophysiological recording
              with computational techniques to study the dynamic interactions among single
              cells in two important taste centers in the brainstem.  Multi-site simultaneous
              recordings display activity patterns for ensembles of nerve cells, which are
              analyzed for their functional connectivity, and for the relatedness of their
              profiles of taste sensitivities.  In going beyond the usual single-unit
              studies, results will permit inferences about the interneuronal dynamics, and
              generate hypotheses about how excitatory and inhibitory connections among
              central subgroups of cells may provide mechanisms for spatial as well as
              temporal central coding for taste.   Results of this novel approach will have
              fundamental importance to better understanding taste mechanisms, which can have
              impact beyond basic science to the food industry; the novel techniques and the
              investigation of coding mechanisms will be useful beyond chemosensory science
              to neuroscience in general.
