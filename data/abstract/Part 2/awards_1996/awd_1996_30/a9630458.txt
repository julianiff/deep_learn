Abstract    :
              9630458  PI:  Seeds  Neurons in the developing and regeneration peripheral
              nervous system (PNS) must accurately direct their long thin axonal process
              toward a specific target tissue.  The path these axons take toward their target
              is often blocked by other cells and extracellular matrix components.  Studies
              will examine the role of the extracellular plasminogen activator (PA) proteases
              in the developing and regenerating PNS.  Plasminogen activators are protein
              degrading enzymes that are secreted by migrating neural crest cells, and
              sensory neurons of the PNS.  These PAs bind with high affinity to a receptor on
              the surface of sensory neurons, where PA is thought to facilitate axonal growth
              and regeneration by cleaving cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions that block the
              path of  the growing neuron.  The dependency of sensory neuron axonal growth
              and extracellular matrix degradation on these PA proteases and their cell
              surface receptors will be assessed in 3-D cultures of extracellular matrix
              proteins using cells from mutant mice that lack the genes for these PA
              proteases and their receptors.  Another approach will determine the importance
              of these extracellular proteases in nerve regeneration for both pain and
              pressure sensitive neurons in these same PA-deficient mutant mice.  These
              studies will provide a greater under standing of the cellular mechanisms by
              which neuronal axons grow to their synaptic targets in both the developing and
              regeneration peripheral nervous system.
