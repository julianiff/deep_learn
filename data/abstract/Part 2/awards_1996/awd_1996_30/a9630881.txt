Abstract    :
              9630881  Mukherjee    This grant provides fundamental understanding of 
              superplastic behavior in nanocrystalline materials.  Ultrafine-grained
              nanocrystalline materials contain a very  large density of interfaces and,
              therefore, offer unique  opportunities for studying the structural state of
              grain  boundaries and their role on grain boundary sliding during 
              superplasticity.  Combining methods for synthesis as well as  consolidation of
              nanopowders, the experimental program  examines superplastic deformation
              behavior of nanometals,  nanointermetallics, and nanocomposites with nanoscale
              oxides  dispersed in the nanoscale metallic matrix.  The scientific  goal is to
              correlate in the context of theoretical models of  superplasticity new
              microstructural information with  mechanical data obtained from nanoscale
              materials.  Special  emphasis is given to the difficulty of intragranular 
              dislocation generation inside the matrix in truly nanoscale  structure and its
              consequences to slip accommodation in  current models of superplasticity. The
              nanostructure before  and after deformation is investigated using transmission 
              electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and internal friction  methods.  %%% 
              The research could lead to new processing techniques for  deformation
              processing of nanocrystalline materials and  could impact future metal alloy
              processing in the metal  forming industries.  ***
