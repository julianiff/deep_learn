Abstract    :
              9630157  Price       In this proposal Professor Price requests support for 
              participation of his group at The University of California  in two activities
              with astrophysical implications.  AMANDA  is an experiment in the Antarctic ice
              designed to record  tracks produced by high energy neutrino interactions.  The 
              group led by Price is leading this effort in characterizing  the relevant
              properties if the ice.  The  group also is  engaged in a significant search for
              postulated Weakly  Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPS) by using atomic-force 
              microscopy applied to ancient mica.  ***
