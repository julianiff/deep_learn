Abstract    :
              This grant will support the adaptation of recent advances in astrophysical
              radiative transfer studies to address several outstanding problems in aeronomy.
               Specifically, the PI will study:  (1) multidimensional radiative transfer,
              including optically thick resonance lines in the aurora, geocorona, and
              twilight, as well as the problem of atomic oxygen measurements using resonance
              lamps; (2) molecular band simulation with correct accounting for non-LTE
              effects; and (3) optimization of large 1-D problems requiring the solution of
              several hundreds to perhaps thousands of individual 1-D problems.  Using the
              Accelerated Lambda Iteration (ALI) method, the PI will approximate the full
              scattering integral to explore rapid, accurate solutions to difficult radiative
              transfer problems in astrophysics.  These methods will lead to the development
              of codes to address problems on aeronomical interest.
