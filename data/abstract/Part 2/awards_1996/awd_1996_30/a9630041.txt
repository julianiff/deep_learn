Abstract    :
              9630041  Resnick    The New Standards Project (a partnership of states and urban
               districts) proposes to develop an on-demand test for science.  Such  a test is
              needed by state-level, district-level, and university  partnerships that are
              engaged in standards-based reform as a way to  measure their progress.  New
              Standards will build upon recent work  in performance assessment in science and
              collect, adapt, and  develop a balance of tasks of various lengths and formats
              that are  mapped to performance standards.  They will conduct item and test 
              validity studies, review all aspects of item development for  accuracy and
              assemble a test that meets practical constraints for  administration.  Design
              and implementation will be carried out at  the University of California, Office
              of the President, Technical  quality assurance will be done by the Learning
              Research and  Development Center, and Science and Equity quality assurance will
               be carried out by the American Association for the Advancement of  Science.
