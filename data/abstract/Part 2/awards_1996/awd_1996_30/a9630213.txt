Abstract    :
              9630213  Barken  Group II introns, found in bacterial and organelle genomes, are
              ribozymes that catalyze their own excision via a mechanism that is closely
              related to that of nuclear pre-mRNA splicing. In analogy to other enzymes
              containing catalytic RNA moieties, proteins are required for efficient group II
              splicing in vivo. However the identities of only two facilitators of group II
              splicing have been reported and their biochemical roles are not understood.
              Chloroplast genomes of higher plants contain numerous group II introns,
              providing potential targets for nuclear-encoded splicing factors, Previous work
              from this laboratory has identified two nuclear mutations in maize, crs1 and
              crs2, that block the splicing of group II introns in the chloroplast.
              Preliminary results suggest that the crs1 mutation blocks the splicing of just
              one group II intron and of no group I introns. In contrast, crs2 blocks the
              splicing of most group II introns in the chloroplast. These are the first
              described mutations that block group II cis-splicing in chloroplasts. Four aims
              of this work are,(1) Further characterization of the mutant phenotypes,
              including a complete analysis of all 5' and 3'-splice junctions in the maize
              chloroplast genome, the expression of the single putative chloroplast
              "maturase", identification of additional alleles, double-mutant analysis and a
              search for RNA-binding activities that are modulated by crs1 and crs2 gene
              function, (2) Cloning of the crs1 and crs2 genes, (3) Analysis of the
              developmental and genetic control of crs1 and crs2 expression correlated with
              the splicing of their target introns, and (4) Identification of new nuclear
              genes that modulate the splicing of group II introns in the chloroplast.  %%% 
              The results of the study may have implications for the understanding of the
              mechanisms and evolution of spliceosomal splicing and for RNA-catalyzed,
              protein-facilitated reactions in general. In addition, this project will
              improve our understanding of the role and mechanisms of regu lated RNA splicing
              in chloroplast development.  ***
