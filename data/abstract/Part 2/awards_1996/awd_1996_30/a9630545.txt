Abstract    :
              Werner-Washburne  9630545  The long-term objective of this research is to gain
              insight into the molecular events involved in the process of entry into,
              survival during, and exit from stationary-phase growth in yeast.  The goal of
              the research is to increase our understanding of developmental regulation of
              signal-transduction pathways in stationary phase:  first, by studying the
              regulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and, second, by identifying other
              pathways and targets of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase that function during
              stationary phase.  The cAMP-dependent protein kinase is extremely dynamic as
              yeast cells enter stationary phase and down-regulation of the kinase activity
              is essential for survival in stationary phase, since strains carrying mutations
              in the regulatory subunit have been characterized that lose viability
              specifically in stationary phase.  Although stationary phase is the most common
              state for microorganisms and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase is one of the
              best-studied kinases, we know very little about this time in the life cycle or
              how kinase activity is regulated in stationary phase.  The aims of this
              research are to extend the studies on the regulation of cAMP-dependent protein
              kinase in stationary-phase yeast, identify and characterized proteins that
              interact with the kinase, and identify other pathways that act positive
              regulators of the stationary phase state in yeast.  This research will,
              therefore, help us to better understand how microorganisms function in nature. 
              It will also have possible benefit in the culturing of microorganisms at high
              cell concentrations, as is done in biotechnology applications of cell culture.
