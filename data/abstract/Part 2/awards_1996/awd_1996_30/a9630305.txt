Abstract    :
              The categories Proximate and Obviative are familiar from  Algonkian linguistics,
              where they serve to distinguish the 3rd  person of greatest discourse salience
              from all other 3rd persons  in a given span. In Algonkian, these categories are
               morphologically visible and though anchored in discourse, they  play a major
              role in the syntax of the clause. While much  previous work has explored the
              relevance of discourse salience to  natural language morphosyntax, the
              categories Proximate and  Obviative have generally been viewed as simply one 
              language-particular way to relate the two. The present project  explores the
              idea that relations of obviation are much more  widely relevant, functioning
              cross-linguistically as an important  structuring device which mediates between
              discourse and clausal  syntax. The key claim to be investigated is that these
              relations  are relevant not only to languages with overt obviative  morphology
              like the Algonkian languages, but also to languages  lacking such morphology.
              The project focuses on languages of the  Mayan family as a case-study,
              especially Tzotzil and Tz'utujil,  languages from distinct sub-families.
