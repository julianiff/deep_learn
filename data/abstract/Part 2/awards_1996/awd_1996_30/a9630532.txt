Abstract    :
              9630532   Kana    The process of denitrification (Biological conversion of
              nitrate to nitrogen gas) is a major mechanism for removing dissolved nitrate
              from water.  Nitrate contamination of surface and ground waters is a growing
              problem worldwide.  This project uses a new technique of  high precision gas
              analysis to study denitrification in riverine and estuarine sediments. 
              Advantages of the new method, developed by the principal investigators, include
              accurate and unambiguous measurement of the end product of denitrification and
              rapid and inexpensive analysis of samples.  The research ill evaluate the
              effects of environmental  factors including temperature, nutrient
              concentrations, and sediment structure on the denitrification process.  This
              project will work towards a better understanding of the relative importance of
              denitrification as a removal mechanism for nitrogen nutrient loading in rivers
              and estuaries.  This proposal was submitted to the Environmental Geochemistry
              and Biogeochemistry solicitation NSF 96-2.  The project described is being
              jointly supported by the Divisions of Earth Sciences, Environmental Biology,
              and International Programs.
