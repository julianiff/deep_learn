Abstract    :
              9630841  Jacobson    The objective of this research is to investigate how
              signals received from nerves control the breakdown of protein in muscle cells. 
              These studies will be carried out in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans,
              which has relatively few muscle and nerve cells, and in which genetic
              experiments can be done.  For these experiments a reporter transgene has been
              introduced into the organism, since the degradation of its protein product can
              be easily followed.  This investigator previously found that this protein is
              stable in well-fed animals, but is broken down upon starvation. This
              instability is counteracted by signals from nerves to the muscles.  These
              experiments are aimed at understanding the molecular basis of the protein
              breakdown, the nerve signals that control it, and the mechanism by which nerve
              signals decrease protein breakdown. Earlier studies (in a previous grant)
              showed that the signaling involves release of acetylcholine by the nerves,
              reception of this signal at the surface of the muscles, and the consequent
              release of calcium ions from storage inside the muscles.  The calcium ions act
              by stimulating the enzyme protein kinase C (PKC) which slows the rate of
              protein breakdown.  In this proposal additional evidence for the role of PKC
              will be sought, the targets of PKC action will be determined, and experiments
              will done to determine how PKC slows the rate of protein breakdown.    A
              distinct group of muscle cells in this animal, that receives different chemical
              signals, will be examined to see whether the same or different signaling
              systems are operating.  The regulation of protein degradation is an important
              question, which these experiments will help to answer.   ***
