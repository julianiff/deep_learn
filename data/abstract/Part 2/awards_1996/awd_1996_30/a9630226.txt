              Los Angeles  Title: Numerical Simulation of Global Atmosphere    This grant
              supports two graduate students over a period of three  years to investigate the
              sensitivity of the Atlantic ocean-  atmosphere interface surface fluxes to 1)
              the local and remote SST  forcing and 2) the upper gradation of the cloud
              microphysics in the  UCLA AGCM.      The understanding of this issue is of
              fundamental importance for  climate modeling efforts.    A successful
              completion of this project will go a long way in the  future evolution of the
              coupled GCMs and climate modeling.
