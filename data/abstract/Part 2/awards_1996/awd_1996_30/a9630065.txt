Abstract    :
              This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
              from the City University of New York. The project is to study the role of
              archaeology in the maintenance and functioning of the Ecuadorian nation-state,
              by examining how images of the archaeological past are used to uphold diverse
              models of the idealized nation-state. Through examination of official and
              popular media, museum exhibitions, textbooks, and interviews with students and
              teachers, the project will assess how groups `use the past` to attain present
              political and social goals.  The researcher will examine the most well-known
              archaeological site in Ecuador to assess how it is represented by the state as
              well as by diverse interest groups, including a national Indian confederation
              as well as elite groups of wealthy archaeological amateurs.  The role of the
              black population will also be studied, since they are denied any presence in
              the population by the ideology of `mestizo-ization` while defined as totally
              inferior by the social preference for white skin.   This research is important
              because it will shed light on the universal process by which societies
              reinterpret the past to attain contemporary social goals.  This case study will
              be especially valuable, dealing as it does with a country which glorifies its
              pre-Inca past while discriminating against contemporary Indian populations and
              balancing the multiple claims from its diverse population.
