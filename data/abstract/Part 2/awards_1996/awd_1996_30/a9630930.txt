              Edwards    The helium isotopes 4He and 3He form Bose and Fermion superfluids 
              respectively.  The solubility of  4He in 3He is very low at ultra-  low  
              temperatures   but  recent  theoretical  predictions   have  suggested  a
              finite value at zero temperature.  If so,  a  weakly  interacting  dilute  Bose
              gas (the dissolved 4He  quasiparticles)  would  coexist in a solution of
              Fermion superfluid and provide  a  unique   opportunity   to  study 
              interacting   superfluids.    A  stringent  test  of  Fermi liquid theory  will
               result  from  the  determination  of  the  solubility.   The  free  energy  of
                the  interface  between  the two coexisting phases in  phase-separated 
              liquid  mixtures will be measured as a function of  pressure  and  temperature.
                 The  results  will  indicate   whether   3He   is  preferentially  adsorbed 
              near  the  interface  and  compared  to  fundamental  many-body quantum
              theories. A   measurement  of  the  coalescence of two helium atom beams is
              planned to determine  the  nature of the scattering cross-section at very low
              velocities and  investigate the dimerization of helium atoms.  %%%  A 
              fundamental  theory of matter, Fermi liquid  theory,  used  to  understand
              systems as disparate as neutron stars, nuclear matter,  and  electrons in
              ordinary and superconducting metals, is  to  be  tested in a new way by
              studying 4He atoms dissolved in liquid 3He  at  extremely low temperatures. The
              experiment is to measure,  at  temperatures less than 0.1 degrees above
              absolute zero, the  rate  at  which  the 4He atoms diffuse through the liquid
              3He  and  the  maximum  amount  that  may  be  dissolved  as  functions  of 
              the  temperature and pressure. The theory predicts a relation  between  these 
              effects. In a second low temperature experiment, two beams  of  colliding  4He
              atoms will be used to measure  the  very  weak  chemical bond between a pair of
              4He atoms.  ***
