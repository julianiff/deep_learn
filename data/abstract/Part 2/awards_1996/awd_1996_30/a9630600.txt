Abstract    :
                  96306000  Standley    Particle-reactive organic contaminants introduced into
              aquatic  environments are quickly concentrated onto suspended particle 
              surfaces and delivered to the sediment surface where intimate  contact with
              benthic organisms occurs. In this innovative project,  the investigators will
              study geochemical-biological interactions  involved in the transfer of
              particle-reactive anthropogenic organic  contaminants from aquatic sediments to
              benthic meio- and  macrofaunal communities. The approach is innovative inasmuch
              as the  effects of sedimentary organic composition, chemical nature of 
              contaminants, and organism feeding pattern will be considered  synoptically in
              field studies and also studied in detail by  experimental manipulation in
              laboratory microcosms. The  investigators anticipate that such studies will
              lead to a clearer  understanding of processes involved in sediment-to-animal
              transfer  of contaminants and to an improved capacity to predict the transfer 
              of organic contaminants between aquatic sediments and benthic  communities.
