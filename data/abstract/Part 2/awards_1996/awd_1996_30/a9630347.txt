Abstract    :
              9630347  Dyer      The  proposed research suggests that grazing animals contain 
              specific biochemicals in their salivary or digestive systems  that   regulate 
              plant  growth.   In  earlier  NSF-sponsored  research  the investigators
              obtained evidence that very  low  concentrations  of  a specific group of 
              proteins  found  in  grasshopper regurgitants can increase plant growth, but
              that  large  dosages may cause reductions.  In this  project  they  will 
              isolate  and  identify  these  specific  plant  growth  compounds.  This work
              will give new insight about  how  such  novel  growth  regulators not found
              normally in  plants  may  affect the physiology, and the growth and development
              of the  plant after it has been grazed.  New information about  this 
              plant-animal   interaction  holds  promise  for   a   better  understanding  
              of  how  large  animal  grazers   and   pest  populations  of  insects may
              influence plant  production  in  grasslands and agricultural crops.
