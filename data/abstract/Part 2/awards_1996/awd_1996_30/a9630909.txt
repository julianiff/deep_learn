Abstract    :
              9630909  Stein  This project will implement, over a period of two years, an
              information management data model that has been developed by the PIs and
              collaborators at no cost to NSF.  The strength and uniqueness of this data
              model is its ability to integrate, into a single processing environment,
              multiple specimen catalogs and to track individual specimen parts and
              collections objects. The hardware and software choices were selected in part
              because they are scaleable and portable to computing platforms that are common
              throughout the collections community.  All intermediate and final development
              products, including design documents, annotated source code, and run-time
              programs, will be made publicly available on an open-access Internet server so
              that they may be freely adopted by other institutions. This project represents
              a conceptual and technical advance in the managment of natural history
              collections information by extending community approaches.  The solution
              developed here will be applicable within many institutions nation- and
              world-wide.  Therefore, this project is being conducted not only in partnership
              between the University of California at Berkeley and the NSF, but also among
              institutions, and between programs and divisions within the NSF (funding has
              been provided by the Database Activities and the Research Collections in
              Systematics & Ecology Programs).
