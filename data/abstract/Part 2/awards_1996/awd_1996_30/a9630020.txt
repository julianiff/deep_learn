Abstract    :
              Robinson  IBN-9630020          Circadian rhythms influence many aspects of the
              functioning of an  organism, such as sleep cycles, reproduction and cognitive 
              abilities.  One frontier in bimlogy is therefore to elucidate the  molecules
              that comprise biological clocks in order to gain new  insights on how
              biological clocks are governed.  This research  focuses on the expression of
              the period (per) gene, one of the  most-well studied genes of the biological
              clock to date.  Dr.  Robinson is measuring changes in per gene expression
              during growth  an maturation, especially as the transition from arrthymical to 
              rhythmical behaviors is being made.  Because the expression of  clock genes has
              never been undertaken in this model system, the  study will generate important
              new information on how clock genes  regulate specific neurobiological and
              behavioral functions.
