Abstract    :
              9630904  Gharakhanian     Simian Virus 40 (SV40) is a small DNA virus which
              undergoes a permissive course of infection in simian cells.  Its major
              structural protein, Vp1, is the basic unit of its pentameric capsomeres.  It is
              synthesized in the cytoplasm of the infected cell late in the permissive
              infection, and along with the minor structural proteins is transported to the
              nucleus where viral assembly takes place.  The early steps of SV40 assembly,
              including the early oligomerization of Vp1 and interactions with the minor
              structural proteins, and the mechanism of its nuclear transport, have not been
              fully explored.  Several lines of evidence suggest the formation of interactive
              Vp1 complexes in the cytoplasm prior to nuclear transport.  Evidence suggests
              that disulfide bonds may be involved in the stable formation of Vp1 oligomers
              and that oligomerization may play a role in the nuclear transport of Vp1. 
              Here, we propose studies on the early Vp1 interactive complexes in permissive
              mammalian cell lines including identifying specific cysteines that may be
              involved in the disulfide bonded Vp1 oligomerization.  The potential role of
              oligomerization and complex formation with the minor structural proteins in the
              nuclear transport of Vp1 will also be explored.  ***
