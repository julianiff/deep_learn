Abstract    :
                                        Abstract                                  This
              proposal capitalizes on the on-going working  relationship between the infrared
              astronomy group at the  University of Rochester and the infrared array detector
               group at the Rockwell International Science Center in the  development of
              long-wave infrared (LWIR) HgCdTe focal plane  arrays for astronomy.    Rockwell
              has developed LWIR HgCdTe arrays under DoD  contracts that are operated with
              large background  irradiance.  Since the dark current need only be much less 
              than the background induced photocurrent these DoD arrays do  not have very
              stringent dark current requirements, and are  operated at high temperatures
              (80K).    Rockwell has developed new Buried Planar Heterojunction  (BPH) HgCdTe
              devices.  Low dark current, high sensitivity 10  micrometer wavelength arrays
              constructed by this technology  are promising possibilities at low temperatures
              (25K - 30K).  However, there are a variety of technical hurdles to  overcome. 
              At these temperatures generation-recombination (G-  R) dark current will
              dominate diffusion dark current  (prevalent at 80K), and G-R current drops
              precipitously with  temperature.  However, at the lower temperatures there can 
              be tunneling dark current in addition, and a decline in  quantum efficiency.   
              This effort will seek to produce devices that do not exhibit  tunneling and
              which have excellent quantum efficiency.  HgCdTe is expected to have wide
              applicability to astronomy  and other applications.
