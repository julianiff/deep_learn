Abstract    :
               This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
              from the City University of New York.  The project is to study the history of
              the development of a working class identity among people in Colombia, South
              America.  The site of the project is Puerto Berrio, the site of an important
              strike by dock-workers in 1945.  Using methods of archival research, family
              life histories and participant observation, the student will trace the
              development of a class identity among local workers and the role of national
              institutions such as unions, government agencies and the press in this identity
              formation.  By tracing the effects of types of worker communities (miners,
              coffee-workers, railroad and dockworkers) on different political consciousness
              (radical, liberal, conservative), the project will test the hypotheses that
              prior labor participation in private or public sector work affected the
              radicalism of the developing worker identity.   This research is important
              because it will advance our historical understanding of the development of
              worker identity in northern South America.  The growth of Communist, Liberal
              and Conservative party ideologies has been an important part of worker identity
              in this general region.  The advance in our knowledge to be produced by this
              project will be useful to explain the course of events in similar areas like
              Nicaragua.  In addition this project will add to the nation's trained expertise
              about this important area of the world.
