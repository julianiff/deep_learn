Abstract    :
              9630694  Crill   This proposal was submitted in response to the Environmental
              Geochemistry & Biogeochemistry solicitation, NSF 96-2. It is being jointly
              funded by the Division of Earth Sciences, Atmospheric Sciences,  and
              Environmental Biology.   The proposed research will address the biogeochemistry
              of methyl bromide, a trace gas that plays a central role in stratospheric and
              tropospheric ozone balance. Limited information is available about its sinks,
              particularly the irreversible uptake and degradation by deposition to soils.
              The PIs propose to determine the effective CH3Br loss rate and the controlling
              chemical, physical, and biological parameters on representative soil and
              vegetative surfaces at near-ambient gas phase mixing ratios. The proposed
              research has three objectives: (1) to determine the rate and ubiquity of CH3Br
              consumption by soils at near ambient levels, (2) to determine in a quantitative
              manner the controls on soils consumption of CH3Br, and (3) to determine the
              magnitude and seasonality of deposition rates of CH3Br by direct measurements
              of soil exchange using chambers over a mature forest soil and an agricultural
              soil in the northeastern U.S..
