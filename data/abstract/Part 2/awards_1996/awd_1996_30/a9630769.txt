Abstract    :
              9630769  Rohrmann  Sequences used by the baculovirus, Autographa californica, 
              to initiate in vivo DNA replication will be identified and characterized.
              Interactions between different components of the replication complex will be
              characterized and their roles in DNA replication determined. A gene, ie-1,
              which is essential for DNA replication and is a transactivator of early gene
              transcription will be characterized. Its interactions with replication origin
              sequences will be investigated and the domains involved in these functions
              mapped. The replication origins used by baculoviruses in vivo will be mapped
              and the structural and functional requirements of a replication origin will be
              determined.  %%%  Relatively little is known about the origins of replication
              in eukaryotic cells or about the factors that control initiation at the many
              origins of replication found in the genomes of such cells. Baculoviruses
              provide a model for eukaryotic genome replication origins because, in contrast
              to other viruses, they do have multiple origins of replication. Moreover, they
              are used as expression systems for the production of properly modified
              recombinant proteins and because late gene promoters used to express
              recombinant proteins depend on DNA replication a better understanding of
              replication in these viruses could lead to the development of improved
              baculovirus expression systems.  ***
