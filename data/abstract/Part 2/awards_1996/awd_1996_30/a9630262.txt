Abstract    :
              Salz   9630262  Gene expression can be controlled by alternative splicing of
              introns and one of the best studied examples of that mechanism is the master
              switch gene of sex determination, Sx1, in Drosophila melanogaster. The gene is
              transcribed in both sexes, but only in the female is a functional protein made
              as a consequence of alternative splicing. The female specific splice requires
              the function of snf, a gene that encodes a protein with homology to the human
              splice proteins U1A and U2B. The goals of this work are (1) to determine
              whether snfs role in Sx1 splicing regulation requires its U1 snRNP and/or U2
              snRNP function, (2) to determine if the human U1A and/or U2B proteins function
              in Drosophila and (3) to identify the Snf protein domains necessary for its
              role in Sx1 splicing regulation.  %%%  As a consequence of the evolutionary
              conservation of the components of the RNA splicing machinery, the data
              generated from the proposed studies will provide a significant contribution to
              the understanding of mechanisms that regulate pre-mRNA splicing in many
              organisms, including humans.
