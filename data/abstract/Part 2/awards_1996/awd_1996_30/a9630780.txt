Abstract    :
              9612367  Gronostajski  Nuclear Factor I (NFI) is one of a class of
              phylogenetically-conserved site-specific DNA-binding proteins that play an
              essential role in fundamental cellular processes including organismal
              development. These studies  examine a simple developmental system in a organism
              containing a single NFI gene. The function of the NFI in the growth and
              development of C. elegans will be studied by the generation of deletion mutants
              in the NFI gene using Tcl targeted mutagenesis. The phenotype of homozygous
              null-mutants, and of organisms expressing specific mutated  forms of NFI will
              yield important insights into how this family of evolutionarily-conserved
              DNA-binding proteins function in C. elegans and other organisms. The phenotype
              of this deletion mutant will be analyzed in respect to cell viability,
              embryonic, and post-embryonic development. If  the null-allele generates an
              early lethal phenotype, it will be carried in a strain containing an
              extrachromosomal array of the wild-type gene which will allow the generation of
              homozygous deletion animals by partitioning of the array. This "reverse
              genetic" approach to understanding NFI function during C. elegans development
              will also allow testing whether the vertebrate NFI genes can complement the C.
              elegans gene and thus assess how useful C. elegans mutants may be in the
              analysis of other multigene families involved in vertebrate development.    ***
