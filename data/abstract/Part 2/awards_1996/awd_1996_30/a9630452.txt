Abstract    :
              9630452  Kohn  This grant supports the work of  a senior, emeritus PI with  a
              long record of distinguished contributions to the theory  of materials.  The
              grant contains work in three different  areas: The first project contains
              further development and  applications of O(N) computational algorithms for
              general  many atom problems.  It also includes work on the inclusion  of Van
              der Waal's forces and of time dependent response in  the local density
              functional calculations.  In the second  part consists of the study of dynamics
              of Hamiltonian  systems subject to finite time-periodic perturbations.  The 
              third project includes continuation of PI's work on atom-  surface interactions
              and properties of Copper-Gold alloys at  finite temperatures.  %%%  This grant
              supports work by one of the founders of the  modern many-body materials theory.
               After a wonderfully  productive career spanning over 40 year, the PI continues
              to  be an active participant in detailed research in many-body  theory.  The
              proposed work  includes further exploration and  application of sophisticated
              computational methods devised  recently by the PI.  It also includes a proposal
              to consider  a long-standing mathematical problem in the response of  systems
              to time dependent forces.  This work, like much of  the prior work  of the PI,
              is timely in bridging  the gap in  system sizes between small devices and the
              largest size that  the computers can reliably handle.  ***
