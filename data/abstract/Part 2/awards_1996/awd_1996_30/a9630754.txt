Abstract    :
              This research focuses on social networks, which are designed to study the
              relationships among individuals or other social entities.  Applications of the
              research are numerous, and include clinical and community psychology, social
              psychology, organizational studies, and anthropology.  A four year program of
              research will be undertaken by the investigator and his collaborators to study
              social network methodology and applications.  Much of this research makes use
              of a new family of statistical models for social networks, based on spatial
              interaction models.  There are five major areas of research proposed:  (1)
              Multivariate generalizations of this new family of models; (2) Additional work
              on the statistical properties of the family; (3). Continued work on a merger of
              algebraic and statistical models; (4) New approaches to the analysis of
              longitudinal networks; and (5) New applications of the statistical methodology,
              particularly to cognitive social structures and epidemics.  This research
              program will generate and improve tools for a more rigorous empirical analysis
              of social and behavioral research, and should provide statistical results of
              interest to methodologists.
