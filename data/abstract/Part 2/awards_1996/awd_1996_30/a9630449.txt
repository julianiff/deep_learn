Abstract    :
              9630449  Loewenberg    Scholars have identified two types of voting, sincere and
              tactical voting.  Sincere voters vote for their most preferred party.  Tactical
              voters may not vote for their most preferred party to insure that their least
              preferred party does not win the election.  In proportional representation (PR)
              systems, the proportion of seats a party wins in the national legislature is
              determined by the proportion of votes the party receives.  Given these rules,
              scholars have assumed that voters in a PR system would always vote sincerely. 
              However, PR systems usually produce governments composed of a coalition of
              parties.  This Doctoral Dissertation Research project hypothesizes that voters
              in PR systems my vote tactically to affect the composition of the governing
              coalition.    As part of the research design the student conducts a series of
              voting experiments.  Scholars have traditionally assumed that voters possessed
              neither the computational ability nor the information to vote tactically in a
              PR system.  An experimental design provides an excellent environment to test
              such specific assumptions.  The results of the experiments will result in
              improved theory and will generate better hypotheses.  Understanding voting
              behavior in a PR system is important since most established and many emerging
              democracies use PR rules.  ***
