Abstract    :
              9630544  PI:  Sanes    During early brain development, the synaptic contacts
              between nerve cells become stronger or weaker. This process depends in large
              part upon the use of these synapses during development, and it apparently leads
              to optimal function of sensory and motor systems. In this regard, excitatory
              synapses, such as those at muscle cells, have been well studied. In contrast,
              we know relatively little about the development of inhibitory synapses which,
              as their name implies, serve to decrease activity in the central nervous
              system. We have previously shown that inhibitory synaptic activity influences
              the structural and functional development in the central auditory system. For
              example, loss of synaptic inhibition leads to changes in dendrite shape and
              changes in the strength of synapses. The present proposal seeks to study the
              mechanisms whereby inhibitory synapses exert these strong effects. In
              particular, we will examine the contribution of an inhibitory transmitter
              receptor, the glycine receptor, and the role of two ions that permeate the
              membrane when glycine is released at the synapse, chloride and bicarbonate. The
              results from these studies should provide insight into the development and
              plasticity of central inhibitory connections.
