Abstract    :
               This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
              from City University of New York.  The student will study the effect of the
              international environmental movement on political activism, self-representation
              and productive activities among people in the Chimalapa forest of Oaxaca,
              Mexico.  This area is home to a pristine forest which is endangered by logging,
              infrastructure development (dams, highways, oil pipelines) and immigration. 
              The local peasant farmers have allied themselves recently with international
              and national environmental activist groups to preserve the region.  These
              effort is also caught up in local and national politics about NAFTA and the
              agrarian reform in Mexico.  Using ethnographic techniques of intensive
              interviews, participant observation as well as surveys of the involved
              organizations, the project will investigate how the activity of the
              environmentalist groups impacts on local peasant political activities, as well
              as how the gender division of labor will be impacted by development projects.  
                This research is important because it will advance our understanding of how
              global and national processes impact local communities.  The specific case of
              forest conservation will provide materials that can generalize to similar
              situations where local communities organize to preserve a valued resource, and
              must learn to balance their relations with NGOs as well as government agencies.
               In addition the project will increase our society's expertise about this
              important area of the world.
