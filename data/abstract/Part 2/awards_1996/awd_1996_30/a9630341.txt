Abstract    :
                      9630341  Grusak  This award supports studies on the processes,
              regulatory mechanisms, and cellular compartments that are involved in the
              transport of micronutrient metals in higher plants.  The capacity to mobilize
              iron, copper, zinc and mangenese in the phloem transport system will be studied
              using a combination of physiological, biochemical and analytical approaches. 
              Special emphasis will be given to identifying the endogenous metal-binding
              compounds (chelators) that are involved in the loading and transport of metal
              ions in the phloem system.  Pea will be used as the experimental system.     
              Details on the cellular events and endogenous compounds involved in the
              transport of metals in higher plants will provide the foundation for
              identifying regulatory mechanisms that mediate the integration of
              metal-associated processes from source tissues to the whole-plant level. 
              Because the transport of metals and other nutrients to developing sink regions
              of the plant is often entirely dependent on phloem delivery, and because metals
              play such an integral role in numerous metablic functions, the understanding
              gained in this research will have significant relevance to improving the
              nutritional quality of seeds, ensuring successful seed germination and early
              seedling development, enhancing the process of phytoremediation, and
              manipulating metal-induced gene expression in sink tissues.
