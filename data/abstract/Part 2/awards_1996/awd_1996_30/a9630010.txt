Abstract    :
               This project involves the dissertation research of a student in cultural
              anthropology from Johns Hopkins University.  The student will study workers in
              a factory in Poland which has been taken over by a western company.   Using
              ethnographic methods of participant observation as a worker on the shop floor
              and in orientation workshops, as well as formal interviews with company
              officials, government officials and workers, the student will attempt to
              delineate how the `socialist` model of work-place identity is being transformed
              (or failing to transform) into a `capitalist` model of the `total quality`
              worker.  Parallels between the change-over from assembly-line to flexible
              accumulation and the change from socialist to capitalist production ethos will
              be explored, since both stressed the importance of making flexible an older,
              more rigid definition of personal worker responsibilities.    By documenting
              the changes in local beliefs about how people `naturally` act in a work-place,
              the project will advance our understanding of how the global process of
              economic restructuring affects workers' actual behavior in the work-place. 
              Because similar changes are taking place in factories around the world, this
              research will contribute to the understanding not only of Eastern Europe, but
              on changes in the global capitalist economy.
