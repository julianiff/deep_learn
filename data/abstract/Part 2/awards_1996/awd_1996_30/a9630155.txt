Abstract    :
                This project involves the research of a cultural anthropologist studying the
              social identities of Australian Aborigines as they are influenced by the
              Australian government's and legal system's attempt to reincorporate them into a
              multi-cultural state.  Using techniques of legal-case analysis and
              socio-linguistic and narrative analysis, as well as participant observation,
              the investigator will study how national ex-colonial systems of law impact upon
              `traditional` subordinate peoples, reshaping the very identities of subordinate
              peoples as they try to incorporate them into a more representative
              socio-political system.  The specific focus of the study is the Australian
              `Native Title Act` which attempted to provide native titles for  unalienated
              lands, so long as the claimants could demonstrate `traditional` native
              identity.  The project will analyze how native people cope with, resist and
              reshape state programs which attempt to redefine the natives into the dominant
              society's image.   This research is important because it addresses a
              significant issue in our time, that of the relationship between state power and
              local identity.  Advances in our understanding of the effects of well-meaning
              programs such as the Australian land title program on the cultural identities
              of the focus populations can help clarify issues in comparable programs such as
              affirmative action programs in the US, or linguistic-cultural rights issues in
              Canada.
