Abstract    :
              963034  Finkelstein    The objective of this project is to determine the
              molecular basis of pattern formation during Drosophila head development. 
              Studies of invertebrates and vertebrates suggest that head and trunk regions
              are patterned by different genetic mechanisms.  Dr. Finkelstein will determine
              the pathway of head development, and compare it to previously described
              paradigms of trunk specification.  Dr. Finkelstein has previously shown that
              the segment polarity genes hedgehog (hh) and wingless (wg) specify the
              identities of specific regions of the head of the adult fruitfly.  In the
              experiments proposed here, he will analyze the expression and function of hh
              and wg in the imaginal discs that give rise to the head.  In addition, he will
              study the molecular interactions of hh and wg with the genes decapentaplegic,
              orthodenticle, and engrailed, which are also involved in head formation. 
              Finally, he will use genetic methods to identify and analyze new loci required
              in the developing head.  By using the combination of molecular and genetic
              approaches possible in Drosophila, he will systematically determine the pathway
              of head development.  Since many of the genes in this pathway are
              evolutionarily conserved, his results will form a foundation for studying head
              formation in other animals.  Ultimately, such studies will be critical for
              understanding how genetic defects perturb normal pathways of development.
