Abstract    :
              9630131  Morse                                  This is a project requesting
              funding for a two weeks trip to  Mongolia by Dr. John Morse, Clemson
              University.  The purpose  of this planning visit  are (1) to collect aquatic
              insect  and fish samples in the Lake Hovsgol region and (2) to  explore the
              ways of helping scientists in Mongolia to  develop expertise in aquatic insect
              identification and water  quality measurements. There is little information on
              aquatic  insects and fishes in the Lake Hovsgol region.  Dr. John  Morse and
              two graduate students will collect insect and  fishes samples to fill the
              information gap in the Lake  Hovsgol region. This information  should improve
              the overall  understanding of this ecosystem.  This project can also  provide
              valuable international opportunities to two U.S.  graduate students to work at
              a unique ecological site in  Mongolia.
