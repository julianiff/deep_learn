Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9630913  STARFIELD  UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA-TWIN CITIES    The
              proposed research will address a major problem in climate change research in
              the Arctic. The role of shifts in treeline due to past climate change will be
              examined using the relationships of modern treeline position with measured
              climate variables. The results from the study of  predicted response of
              treeline position to climate changes in the past will then be used to examine
              future changes that could take place due to proposed climate changes in the
              future.  The consequences of feedbacks to climate change due to the movement of
              the treeline is important to ascertain so that management and policy decisions
              can be made concerning the impacts of global change and other disturbance
              factors on human use of forest resources in the Arctic.
