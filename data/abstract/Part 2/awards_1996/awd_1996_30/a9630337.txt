Abstract    :
                  Abstract  9630337  Poovaiah    Protein phosphorylation is one of the major
              mechanisms for transducing extracellular signals to intracellular responses.   
               Calcium is important in mediating a number of signaling pathways, and
              Ca+/Calmodulin (CM) regulated protein phosphorylation amplifies and modifies Ca
              mediated signals. Several Ca/CaM dependent protein kinases have been well
              characterized in mammalian systems, but little is known about Ca/CaM dependent
              protein kinases in plants. The laboratory of the PI has cloned a chimeric
              Ca/CaM dependent protein kinase gene from developing anthers.  This CCaMk
              contains a catalytic domain, a CaM binding domain and a visin-like Ca binding
              domain  in one polypeptide.  This protein is distinct form other known plant
              and animal kinases, and its structure suggests it may have evolved from the
              fusion of two genes that are functionally and phylogenetically diverse.  This
              is the first evidence for a Ca/CaM dependent protein kinase in plants.   In
              this grant the structure function relationships of CCaMK as well as the effects
              of altered levels  in the plant, will be examined.  Deletion and point mutants
              will be studied to determine the function of the regulatory domain, and the
              role of autophosphorylation sites will be confirmed using site directed
              mutants.  Synthetic peptides will be used to identify and study the
              autoinhibitory domain.    The effect of altered expression of CCaMK will be
              observed in transgenic plants with sense or antisense constructs of the CCaMK
              gene.   These studies should establish the presence and the role of this
              important enzyme in plants.      ***
