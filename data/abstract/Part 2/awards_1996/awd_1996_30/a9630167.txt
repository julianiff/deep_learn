Abstract    :
              9630167  Odom  The major strategies to yield permanent improvements in the
              quality  of science and technology research that will increase the 
              competitiveness of the State's major research universities for  federal and
              private sector R&D funds are: 1) the addition of new  tenure track faculty in
              targeted research areas, 2) graduate  student support, and 3) programs to
              increase linkages between  academic researchers and their industrial
              colleagues.  Three multi-  disciplinary research areas have been selected for
              enhancement  based on their scientific merit and potential for high payoff and 
              success.  They are:  Mechanics and Materials Research to Evaluate  and Improve
              the Strength of Structural Joints in Transportation  Systems; Fundamental
              Studies at Polymer/Material Interfaces: A  Junior Faculty Development Proposal
              in Optical Sensing; and An  Interdisciplinary Program in Signal Transduction. 
              Partnerships  with two other NSF-funded initiatives in South Carolina-the 
              Statewide Systemic Initiative (SSI) and Alliance for Minority  Participation
              (AMP) programs will also be established to increase  the number of minority
              students being encouraged to pursue careers  in science, engineering and
              mathematics fields.
