Abstract    :
                    9630842  Hirsch  The Sinorhizobium meliloti-alfalfa symbiosis, which leads
              to the formation of novel structure--the root nodule in which atmospheric
              nitrogen is reduced to ammonia--has been well studied.  On the other hand, the
              mycorrhizal symbiosis, which enables plants to grow in phosphorous-deficient
              soil, is less well studied.  Chemical signals produced by both the plant and
              the bacterium are involved in establishing the interaction between the two
              organisms.  Dr. Hirsch and her colleagues have determined that VAM-fungi induce
              the expression of at least two plant genes in mycorrhizal roots that are
              usually triggered by inoculation with rhizobia.  Alfalfa plants will be studied
              for their early responses to the VAM fungi.  The roots will be inoculated with
              the spores of the fungi, the progress of infection by fungal hyphae will be
              followed, and the timing and patterns of expression of selected plant genes
              will be analyzed.  This award supports feasibility of using the expression of
              these early nodulin genes as molecular indicators for developing a bioassay to
              detect a putative Myc factor, i.e., a chemical signal that induces the
              expression of specific plant genes in VA-mycorrhizal roots, and is involved in
              establishing this important symbiosis.
