Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this project is to determine how the  properties of atomic
              nuclei depend upon their temperature T  and rotational spin I.  Neutrons and
              protons move in nuclear  orbitals, which vary with T and I.  Each nucleus has a
              shape,  which changes as T and I are altered.  Increasing T or I  generates
              transitions from one nuclear shape to another, for  example, prolate
              (football), oblate (discus), spherical, etc.  There are also transitions in how
              the shape is oriented relative  to the rotation axis.  The rotation axis might
              be parallel to or  perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the shape, or at any 
              intermediate angle.  A single nucleus may also have transitions  between a
              normal fluid phase and various kinds of superfluid  phases.  The superfluid
              phase may contain correlated pairs of two  neutrons, two protons, or one
              neutron and one proton.  The  internal spins of the two particles in a pair
              might be parallel  or anti-parallel.  Because atomic nuclei are small systems,
              they  have large fluctuations in their shape, the orientation of the  shape
              relative to the rotation axis, and the amount of  superfluidity.
