Abstract    :
              IBN:  9630813  PI:  Sueoka    The nervous system of higher organisms consists of
              neurons and glial cells; the function of glial cells is to help neurons. These
              two cell types are known to come from common, embryonic precursor cells (neural
              stem cells). The differentiation of neural stem cells into neurons and glial
              cells, therefore, is the critical process for the development of the nervous
              system. In spite of the fundamental importance of stem cell differentiation,
              the mechanisms underlying this differentiation (identification of the genes
              involved and the functions of these genes) are not well understood. We have
              isolated and characterized in detail a rat stem cell line that differentiates
              into neurons and glial cells in culture. This system is ideal for molecular
              studies on the neuronal-glial differentiation of neural stem cells. Using this
              system, we have isolated several candidate gene fragments that may be
              critically important for neural stem cell differentiation. Using these
              fragments, we plan to isolate and characterize the genes and determine their
              functions in the development of the nervous system. Among several gene
              fragments that are potentially important, there is a particularly promising
              gene fragment which we are going to study first. The gene corresponding to this
              fragment is expressed in the neuronal cell line but not in the stem cell line.
              This fragment has a region with almost identical DNA sequence to a control
              region of a Drosophila gene that is essential for the development of the
              nervous system.
