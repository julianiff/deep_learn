Abstract    :
              In 1994, the The International Society for Plant Molecular  Biology's Commission
              on Plant Gene Nomenclature (CPGN)  opened a Registry of Sequenced Plant Genes
              to serve as an  international clearing house for reviewing and assigning  gene
              designations for sequenced plant genes.  The  nomenclature developed by the
              CPGN is based on the  function of gene products and is common across the plant 
              kingdom. The project has been supported with funds from  the USDA and from the
              European Commission which  underwrites the operations of the CPGN in Europe, 
              including a Registry Office in Norwich, UK. The "Mendel"  database implemented
              in the ACEDB database management  system is currently accessible over the WWW
              at:  http://probe.nalusda.gov:8300/.    In this project, the International
              Society for Plant  Molecular Biology through the CPGN will continue to  provide
              standardized common designations for sequenced  plant genes and to re-evaluate
              the technology support  infrastructure for the project.  Advisory committees of
               scientific users and of bioinformaticians will undertake a  needs analysis,
              the production of a data model and design  planning for the project in order to
              increase the level of  automation and efficiency of data acquisition and 
              verification.  The current system of collecting data in a  flat file system
              will be examined and re-implemented based  on the recommendations of the
              technical and scientific  advisory committees. The specific objectives of the 
              project are to: 1) Expand the system of working groups to  include all shared
              categories of plant genes plus certain  categories of special scientific,
              industrial, or  pharmaceutical importance, 2) Develop plant-wide  designations
              for 4,000 plant-wide families of genes by the  end od 1999. These designations
              will correspond to 90  percent of all isolated plant genes and for most genes 
              expected on the basis of known proteins and metabolic  pathways, 3) Re-design
              Mendel from its present system of  linked flat files to a single database on
              the A CEDB  platform (http://probe.nalusda.gov:8000/acedocs), 4)  Organize a
              system for reciprocal updates of Mendel between  the American and European
              registry offices of the CPGN and  5) Organize an on-line, real-time system of
              communication  with EMBL/GenBank.
