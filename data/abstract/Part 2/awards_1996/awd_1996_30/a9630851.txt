Abstract    :
              Gibbs  9630851      The gonadal steroid hormones have marked and various effects
              on the  central nervous system.  However, the receptors for these powerful 
              hormones are not restricted to areas of the brain involved in  reproduction,
              but are also found in the hippocampus and cerebral  cortex.  These areas
              receive dense input from neurons containing  the neurotransmitter
              acetylcholine.  It has long been postulated  that the cholinergic neurons play
              an important role in learning and  memory and may be influenced by a variety of
              factors, including  estrogen.  This effect of estrogen may be mediated, in
              part, by  growth factors.  In the experiments supported by this award, the 
              effects of estrogen on acetylcholinergic function and growth factor  production
              are being investigated.  These studies will provide  significant new
              information regarding the mechanisms by which  estrogens influence cognitive
              function.  As populations age,  estrogen levels decline and how this impacts on
              cognitive function  is crucial to improving the quality of life of the general 
              population.
