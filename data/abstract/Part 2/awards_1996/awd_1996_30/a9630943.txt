Abstract    :
                   There are several known cases of sensory systems where some particular
              stimulus feature, such as visual space or sound frequency, is represented in
              some kind of organized "map" in the brain.  The sensory system that has been
              most difficult to map in this way has been taste, in both vertebrates and
              invertebrates.  There now is a lot of information on taste physiology in some
              invertebrates, and this project utilizes the fly as a model system, where both
              physiology and anatomy are used to trace particular taste pathways into
              well-described parts of the fly brain.  Standard electrophysiological
              recordings of single nerve cells in the taste pathway will allow
              characterization of a cell's sensitivity to different taste compounds, and dye
              injections of those cells will allow tracing how the central terminals of each
              tested cell projects into central brain regions.  Finding out whether the four
              different classes of peripheral taste cells have central connectivity that
              shows functional groupings would be major step in understanding the circuitry
              underlying taste.     Results from study of this model system will have an
              impact on chemosensory work in other animals, on our understanding of feeding
              behavior, of central sensory connectivity in general, on insect-plant
              interactions and potentially on mechanisms for pest control.
