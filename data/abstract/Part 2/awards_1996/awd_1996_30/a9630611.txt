Abstract    :
              Lewis  9630611      Reproductive behavior is mediated by a hormone called 
              gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) which is produced by cells in  the brain.
               This hormone is secreted by neurons and binds to a  specific protein, called a
              receptor, on GnRH target cells.   However,  little is known about how the
              binding of this hormone to  its receptor influences other nerve cells and
              subsequently controls  reproductive behavior.  Dr. Lewis is investigating the
              mechanisms  by which GnRH binding to its receptor changes the excitability of 
              neurons.  She is using a unique and powerful system to express the  GnRH
              receptor in nerve cells that do not normally contain the  receptor.  Her
              studies center on the coupling of the receptor to  intracellular second
              messenger systems, which lead to changes in  permeability to various
              electrically charged molecules.  These  investigations will generate valuable
              insights into the coupling of  intracellular messengers with receptor
              activation, and provide an  improved understanding of the basic principles
              underlying  reproduction in all species.
