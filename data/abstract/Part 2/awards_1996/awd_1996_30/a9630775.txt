Abstract    :
              9630775  Krishna  The proposed research will focus on the structures and 
              dynamics of long chain neurotoxins isolated from the  New World scorpion
              Centruroides sculpturatus Ewing, and  the Old World species Leiurus
              quinquestriatus  quinquestriatus. Specifically, several neurotoxic  proteins
              from both species will be purified and  sequenced.  The proteins that will be
              characterized will  include both the long chain - and neurotoxins.  Standard 
              2D-NMR methods as well as NOESY-TOCSY will be employed to  extract experimental
              constraints needed for structure  refinement calculations.  Protein breathing
              motions will  be probed by measuring amide proton exchange life times.  The
              order parameters and correlation times will be  measured from 13C relaxation
              time measurement at natural  abundance using a double DEPT sequence.  The
              differences  in the structures and dynamical behavior within each  class, and
              between the two classes of proteins will be  examined.  A number of hypotheses
              on the structure-  function relationships among this class of proteins will  be
              tested.  %%%  Neurotoxins serve as excellent probes of ion channels  Despite a
              high degree of sequence homology, the scorpion  neuroxtoxins can differ
              dramatically in their toxicities  and the nature of interactions with the ion
              channels.  The proposed studies will be important in understanding  the
              intriguing differences exhibited by the - and -  toxins.  This work will
              significantly enhance fundamental  knowledge on the molecular mechanism of
              interactions  between the neurotoxic proteins and the sodium channel.  ***
