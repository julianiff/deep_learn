Abstract    :
              9630426  Prechtl    The mechanisms by which the cortex mediates the perception 
              and recognition of objects in the environment is an  important, but little
              understood aspect of brain function.  Research funded by this grant exploits
              the technical and  behavioral advantages of studying the reptilian brain in 
              order to learn about fundamental cortical mechanisms of  perception.  In
              particular, optical methods are used to  analyze electrical brain activity in
              an entire cortical area  while the animal perceives a variety of behaviorally 
              relevant visual stimuli.  The perceptual interpretation of  each visual
              stimulus is indexed  by simultaneously  monitoring the response of the animal
              to the stimulus.  The  aim is to identify those features of large scale
              cortical  activity that are related to cognitive processes such as  recognition
              and categorization.    This research is expect to lead to a deeper
              understanding of  how large-scale electrical activity in animal brains is 
              related to cognitive function.
