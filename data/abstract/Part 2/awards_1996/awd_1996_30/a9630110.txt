Abstract    :
              This award is a Research Planning Grant in the Organic Dynamics Program   of the
              Chemistry Division.  With these funds, Professor Cassandra Fraser   of  the
              University of Virginia will study metal-centered star-shaped   polymers and
              block copolymers.  Metal complexes will serve as the central   cores of the
              polymers and the polymer arms will be generated using living   polymerization
              techniques.  Variation of the metal complex will allow for   a wide variety of
              possible three dimensional molecular structures, all   unknown, with much
              flexibility in the properties and in the domain   structure. The work will
              explore the methodology for preparation of such   a class of materials and will
              develop characterization protocols based on   standard spectroscopic techniques
              and on multi-angle laser light   scattering.    Systematic and predictable
              variation of the properties of materials   offers a prime strategy for
              optimization of their behavior.  This work   will explore a new series of
              polymeric materials which are expected to   exhibit unusual properties and, in
              the long run, to lead to potential   artificial enzymes and to materials
              sensitive to heat, light, and   electricity.
