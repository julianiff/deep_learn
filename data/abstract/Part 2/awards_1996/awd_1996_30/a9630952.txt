Abstract    :
                Strome  9630952      Asymmetric cell divisions generate daughter cells with
              different developmental fates.  This proposal investigates how
              maternally-supplied factors control asymmetric divisions in the   early C.
              elegans embryo. The maternal-effect gene, mes- 1, plays a crucial role in
              promoting  the unequal divisions that generate somatic founder cells and the
              germ lineage. The progeny of   mes-1 mothers are sterile, due to a
              transformation of the primordial germ cell, P4, into a  muscle precursor, like
              its somatic sister cell, D. The underlying cause of this cell fate  
              transformation is loss of spindle asymmetry and defective cytoplasmic
              partitioning in the cells  that generate P4 and D.  Dr. Strome's studies of the
              mutant phenotype have suggested several models for  how MES-1 participates in
              promoting unequal divisions and unequal partitioning in embryonic  cells. MES-1
              contains a putative transmembrane domain and shows sequence similarity to 
              receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, which suggests a mechanism for the various
              models    proposed. A second C. elegans gene, whose mutant phenotype is
              unknown, shows striking    sequence similarity to mes-l. This proposal is to
              test where and how MES-1 functions in the  early embryo, to determine whether
              the MES-1-related protein participates with MES-1 in    controlling unequal
              divisions in the embryo, and to identify other proteins that interact with 
              MES-1 and which may be ligands or target molecules for MES-1.  Aim 1: 
              Molecular analysis and localization of the MES-1 protein.  Aim 2:  Molecular
              and phenotype analysis of the mes-1-like gene, msl-1.  Aim 3:  Identification
              of other proteins that function with MES-1 In controlling unequal divisions.
