Abstract    :
              9630734  Crane    Research Communications Ltd. will develop research designs,
              measurement, and analysis techniques for the assessment of the impacts of
              informal science learning television programming and other media.  Experts in
              the fields of psychology, science education, communications research, and
              evaluation and testing will develop methodologies and instruments to:    o
              better assess impact on attitudes, cognition, and behavior for specific
              audiences,    o take into account the idea that informal science learning may
              take a variety of forms, and    o better assess cumulative impacts of
              television and other media on informal science learning.    The PI's for the
              project will be Valerie Crane, President of RCL, and Beth Rabin and Suzanne
              Carter, both on the RCL staff.  Advisors would include experts in research on
              children's television programming such as Ellen Wartella and Keith Mielke,
              specialists in inquiry-based learning and formal and informal science curricula
              such as Matthew Schneps, and specialists in evaluation and testing such as
              Edward Chittenden.
