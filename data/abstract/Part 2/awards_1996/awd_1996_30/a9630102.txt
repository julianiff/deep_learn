Abstract    :
              This research investigates interoperable query processing with heterogeneous
              networked information servers.  Servers may be databases, image servers, WAIS
              servers, or Internet search engines.  The sources may support OLE (Object
              Linking and Embedding) DB or ODMG/OQL (Object Data Management Group/Object
              Query Language)-like interfaces.  Architectures are based on mediators (based
              on some common data model), and wrappers (that provide answers from sources in
              the common model and format). This research defines WHOL, a High Order Wrapper
              Language, to extend wrapper technology  and support mediator queries that
              cannot be directly evaluated against the sources.  Techniques for evaluating
              WHOL queries are developed.  WHOL supports scalability, as new (dissimilar)
              sources are incorporated, and extends wrappers into active brokers of
              information. Techniques for flexible mediator query processing are developed, 
              for wrappers whose capability ranges from simple parameterized functions, to
              support  complex optimization and evaluation engines.  Cost models for mediator
              query processing, and semantics for query evaluation in wrappers with
              unavailable sources, are also developed.  Algorithms are developed for wrapper
              query processing with time-varying descriptions, and other meta-data, on
              sources.  Solutions will be incorporated within the Disco architecture being
              developed in INRIA, France.  This research will extend the capability and
              scalability of wrappers and mediators in heterogeneous networked architectures
