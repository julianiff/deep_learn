              Earth Observatory  Title: Present and Past Variability in Monsoon Climate Over
              the Himalayas from Tree Rings    This award supports a research project
              designed to reconstruct climate of the past few centuries over Nepal from a
              network of climatically sensitive, absolutely dated, annual tree-ring
              chronologies.  The principal tree-ring variable for this purpose is ring width.
               However,  some of the wood collections will also be processed for tree-ring
              density to extract as much useful climate information as possible from the
              tree-rings.  The principal emphasis will be on reconstructing various features
              of the Southwest Monsoon as it affects the Himalayas.  Past temperatures, which
              tend to be tightly linked to variations in the ring density, will also be
              reconstructed.  Therefore, a variety of climatic reconstructions will result
              from this research.   All of the pre-1960 Nepalese climate records will be
              digitized and analyzed to better understand the spatial patterns of climate in
              Nepal, their relationships with longer records in India, and for calibrating
              the tree-ring reconstructions of past climate.   50-100 tree-ring chronologies
              will be developed  in Nepal over the life of this project.  Most of these
              chronologies will exceed 200 years in length, with some extending back 300-400
              years.  In addition, attempts will be made to gain access to Bhutan, northern
              Pakistan, Kashmir, and Sikkim to extend the geographic coverage of this effort.
