Abstract    :
              9630381  PI:  Crews    Appropriate neural control of muscle function requires
              that nerve cells form specific synaptic connections with muscles during
              embryogenesis. The reproducibility of these connections in both vertebrates and
              invertebrates implies the existence of precise recognition events between nerve
              cell and muscle. The Drosophila abrupt gene encodes a regulatory protein that
              directs nerve-muscle recognition during embryonic development, and this
              proposal represents a concerted effort to define a molecular pathway, centered
              around Abrupt, that controls this process. Genetic and molecular approaches
              will be utilized to define the cell type (nervous system or muscle) in which
              Abrupt functions, the identity and function of the genes that Abrupt regulates,
              and additional factors that interact with Abrupt to control nerve-muscle
              recognition.
