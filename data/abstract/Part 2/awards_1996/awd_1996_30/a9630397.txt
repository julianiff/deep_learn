Abstract    :
              9630397  Bazzaz    The central role of competition in the ecology and evolution 
              of   plant   is  a  widely  accepted  concept.    Yet,   our  understanding  of
               the  mechanisms of  competition  is  quit  limited,  in  part  because  it 
              does  not  have  a   strong  mechanistic  basis.  This project proposes a 
              novel,  multi-  level  approach  to  the  study of plant  competition.   The 
              approach   combines   a   new  method   for   characterizing  physiological  
              aspects   of   resource   competition   with  traditional growth analyses and
              demographic techniques.  The  system  chosen for the study is competitive
              interactions  in  experimentally established field monocultures of  two  birch 
              species,  (Betula  alleghaniensis and B. populifolia),  that  differ in their
              requirements for light, water and nutrients.  Resource uptake and stand
              development will be monitored  for  two years.  A third year will be devoted to
              processing plant  and soil samples and to modeling and synthesizing data.  The 
              results  will allow us to assess the magnitude and  relative  importance of
              competition for light and nutrients at various  stages  of  stand  development,
              and to  empirically  test  a  number  of current hypotheses regarding resource
              competition  among  plants.   The research will be an important  step  in 
              bridging  the  gap  between well-developed  phenomenological  models  of plant
              competition and stand development, and  the  physiological mechanisms of
              competition.
