Abstract    :
                    9601573  Evans  This Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program award
              is made  to partially fund the acquisition of a full field inelastic  strain
              and temperature measurement of complex material specimens  when subjected to
              cyclic loads.  It will be possible to have both  high hand low scale spatial
              resolutions of the measurements.   This will allow one to study stress
              concentrations and their  changes during cyclic inelastic deformations.  These
              measurements  can be correlated with mechanics models and by iterating between 
              the models and measurements obtain accurate data for both.  Such  integration
              requires the ability to measure parameters that  provide the critical linkages.
