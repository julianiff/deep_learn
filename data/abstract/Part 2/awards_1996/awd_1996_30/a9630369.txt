Abstract    :
              9630369  Jacobs-Lorena    The ultimate goal of this project is to understand the
              role of mRNA stability in cell differentiation and in the establishment of the
              embryonic body plan. The focus is on the Drosophila fushi tarazu (ftz) mRNA,
              whose instability is likely to play a major role in the establishment of the
              ftz expression pattern in seven stripes that encircle the embryo.  Previously,
              a destabilizing element was mapped to the 3'-untranslated region of the
              message, close to the polyadenylation site (named FIE3 or ftz instability
              element in the 3'UTR). At least one more destabilizing element (named FIE5) is
              located in the 5'-one-third of the mRNA. The research plan has the following
              aims.  1) To probe into the FIE3 structure-function relationships. The FIE3
              will be modified by site- directed mutagenesis and the stability of mRNAs
              carrying mutant FIE3s will be assessed in embryos by use of the in vivo assay. 
              2) To map and characterize the 5'-instability element.  The location of the
              other instability element, FIE5, will be determined by deletion-mapping. Its
              sequence and structure will be compared to that of FlE3 and of other unstable
              embryonic mRNAs.  3) To determine the importance of ftz mRNA instability for
              early embryonic development. Genes bearing ftz mRNAs with altered instability
              elements but encoding the wild type protein will be transformed into the germ
              line and the phenotypes of the resulting transgenic flies will be analyzed. The
               functional importance of each FIE will be assessed by measuring ftz expression
              patterns, and embryonic and adult phenotypes, of flies lacking one or both
              FIEs.  4) To determine whether the activity that degrades the ftz mRNA is
              developmentally regulated..  Previous experiments have shown that a mRNA
              carrying FIE3 is stable in the ovary and unstable in the embryo. Possible
              developmental regulation of ftz degrading activity will be  investigated by
              measuring the stability of FIE containing mRNAs at different  developmental
              stages and in different cell type s.
