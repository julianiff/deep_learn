Abstract    :
              With this renewal award, the Organic Dynamics Program is supporting the   work
              of Professor Dowd from the University of Pittsburgh. The focus of   this
              research is a detailed understanding of the pathway used by vitamin   K which
              is a cofactor for carboxylase. This system is responsible for   activating the
              proteins for the blood-clotting cascade. The study is to   include elaborating
              the details of how vitamin K  is oxidized and whether   or not dialkoxy
              dianions are an integral part of the pathway. An   additional goal is to
              establish the relationship between Vitamins K and E   with regard to the latter
              acting as an inhibitor of the Vitamin K   pathway.   Vitamin K is the
              blood-clotting vitamin. As such, it is an obligatory   cofactor for a
              carboxylase that bears responsibility for activating the   proteins of the
              blood-clotting cascade.  Professor Dowd is to focus on   the mechanistic
              details of the pathway followed by vitamin K when it   facilitates the
              blood-clotting process.
