Abstract    :
              In this study Professor David Micha of the University of Florida is being  
              supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the  
              Division of Chemistry.  Theoretical methods are being developed which   treat
              the time-evolution of electronic excitation, electron transfer and   orbital
              polarization in ion-atom collisions and in electron transfer   collisions.  The
              goal of this theory, which is based on time-dependent   molecular orbitals, is
              to provide new insights, concepts, and methods for   describing collision-
              induced and photo-induced electronic transitions.    A related objective is the
              development of methods for computing the time   evolution of electronic state
              populations, differential and integral   cross sections, and electronic
              branching ratios.  Applications are being   made to the description of
              atom-atom, atom-diatom, and atom-solid surface   collisions.    The evolution
              in time of the properties of atoms and molecules as they   undergo collisions
              or interactions with light can be described by modern   theoretical and
              computational methods based on quantum mechanics.  In   this study new
              procedures for obtaining these descriptions are being   developed and applied
              to a wide variety of chemically interesting   systems.
