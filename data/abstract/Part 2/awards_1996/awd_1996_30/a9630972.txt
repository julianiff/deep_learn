Abstract    :
              9630972  Schotland    In the absence of input from the brain, neuronal circuitry
               located  entirely in the spinal cord is capable of generating highly  complex 
              coordinated movements.  This research proposal seeks to  understand the 
              organization of these networks in the generation of  movements.  Although a 
              considerable body of research exists which focuses on the  location and 
              connections of these neural networks, how the appropriate  motor pattern is 
              chosen remains unknown.  This proposal takes a different  approach by 
              evaluating the effects of time on the organization of these  neural  circuits. 
              The response to sensory stimuli can range from a  single impulse,  to a few
              impulses, to a train of high-frequency impulses.  These different  impulse
              patterns might activate different kinds of neurons,  might activate  the same
              set of neurons in different ways, or may activate  different  chemical neuronal
              activating systems.  The results of this  research may  shed light on how
              appropriate motor patterns are "chosen" by  the temporal  structure of the
              excitation to spinal neural circuits.
