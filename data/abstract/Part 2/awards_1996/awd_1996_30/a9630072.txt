Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  OPP-9630072  MASCHNER    Recent research in the lower Alaska Peninsula
              and Unimak Island has demonstrated that this area is critical to our
              understanding of the development of Aleut society and human adaptation to
              climate change and landscape evolution in the region. A broad regional approach
              to these problems depends on large-scale systematic archaeological survey.
              Because of the expense of doing survey in this remote region, satellite images,
              aerial photography, a Geographic Information System and statistical modeling,
              combined with field controls, will be employed and tested. If successful, this
              method will greatly facilitate the discovery of archaeological sites and
              enhance our understanding of regional ecology and human adaptation in the North
              Pacific region.
