Abstract    :
              The research will explore mechanisms to mitigate shortcomings of traditional
              meeting and negotiation processes that take place during software development. 
              Requirements for collaborative design meeting environments will be identified
              and mechanisms to satisfy these requirements will be explored.  This research
              is part of the CAIRO (Collaborative Agent Interaction Control and
              Synchronization) effort which is the core of the DaVinci change management
              project at the Intelligent Systems Engineering Laboratory.  The project aims to
              test a distributed communication infrastructure, automated coordination and
              facilitation mechanisms, and a design-rationale capture (group-memory)
              framework.  The CONACYT collaboration with the Centro de Investigacion
              (Cientifica y de Educacion Superior de Ensenada (CICESE) in Mexico includes
              both research and educational thrusts.  The design rationale capture (group
              memory) system developed at CICESE will be integrated with the CAIRO
              environment, and the CICESE effort will focus on the design of
              intelligent-agent representatives that will automatically determine user
              preferences within CAIRO.  Coupling and MIT systems will provide an effective
              environment for exploring distributed collaboration.
