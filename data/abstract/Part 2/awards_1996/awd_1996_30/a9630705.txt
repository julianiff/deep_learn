Abstract    :
              Stephenson  9630705    The eggs of most animals are asymmetric, and this
              asymmetry establishes the pattern of the embryo during early development.  In
              the best understood case, a localized mRNA, that of the bicoid gene, is
              localized to the anterior margin of Drosophila (fruit fly) eggs, and directs
              the development of anterior embryonic structures.  While the development role
              of bicoid mRNA is fairly well understood, the mechanism by which it is
              localized is not.  The work in this application is directed toward obtaining a
              better understanding of the localization of bicoid mRNA and the roles of 
              molecules that participate in this process.  One emphasis will be to determine
              the function of the swallow gene, whose protein product is required for bicoid
              mRNA localization.  To this end Dr. Stephenson will try to identify and
              characterize other proteins that associate with the swallow protein in vivo and
              in vitro.  He will also determine the subcellular distribution of swallow
              protein by fusing it to the fluorescent protein GFP.  These experiments should
              give him a more complete view of the localization mechanism and of the specific
              role of swallow.  A second emphasis will be to identify other proteins that
              interact with bicoid mRNA during the localization process.  There is
              circumstantial evidence that bicoid mRNA is associated with the egg
              cytoskeleton, and he will explore this association in more detail and
              characterize some of the molecules that participate in it.
