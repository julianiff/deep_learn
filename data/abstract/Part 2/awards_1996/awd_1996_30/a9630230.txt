Abstract    :
                                        ABSTRACT                                  PI:  Ryan 
              PROPOSAL NUMBER:  9641522          Females often base their choice of mates on
              conspicuous  traits borne by males.  Studies in a variety of taxa show  that
              females attend to acoustic, visual, or chemical cues  when evaluating mates. 
              Although males can possess suites of  traits that influence their
              attractiveness to females,  most  studies, however, examine female preferences
              for single  traits.  This leaves unresolved the issue as to what role  female
              preferences play in maintaining suites of traits.  Do  female s exert
              preferences that determine the extent to  which male traits are correlated? 
              Or, alternatively, do  females prefer a single or perhaps a few male traits,
              and  the resultant constellation of traits is due to various  factors that
              constrain the presence of male traits?  For  example, if female were to prefer
              longer males with no  attention to overall body mass, this preference would
              result  in them mating preferentially with longer and heavier males  since body
              length and body mass are usually correlated.     It has been difficult to
              ascertain female preferences for  multiple traits in the visual domain because
              technology has  not been available to easily animate and morph traits from  one
              male onto another.  We will utilize recent advances in  video technology that
              will allow us to determine the role of  female preferences in explaining the
              degree of correlation  of male body sexes, sword length, and complex courtship 
              behavior in three species of swordtail fishes.  These  studies promise to
              provide insights into the general  question as to how and why the sexes differ
              as they do
