Abstract    :
              Gary Solon  University of Michigan  SBR-9630918    Recent discussions of sources
              of inequality have suggested that  individuals' human capital and other
              socioeconomic outcomes may  be strongly influenced by the neighborhoods in
              which the  individuals grew up.  Particular concern has focused on the role  of
              "underclass" neighborhoods in perpetuating poverty and welfare  dependency. 
              The purpose of this research is to identify an upper  bound on the
              socioeconomic impact of community origins by  estimating correlations between
              neighboring children in their  later socioeconomic status as adults.  The
              estimates will be  based on data from the Panel Study on Income Dynamics, which
              has  sampled neighboring children and followed them into adulthood.   This
              approach can identify only an upper bound on the influence  of neighborhoods
              because the observed neighbor correlations will  reflect the influence of
              similar family backgrounds as well as  the influence of shared community
              background.  Nevertheless,  neighbor correlations will provide crucial
              information on the  potential scope of neighborhood effects.  Large neighbor 
              correlations would leave open the possibility that neighborhoods  are very
              influential.  Small neighborhood correlations would  indicate that community
              origins must play only a minor role.
