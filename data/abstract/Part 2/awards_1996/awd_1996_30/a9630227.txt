Abstract    :
              Burch   MCB-96-3022  Eukaryotic genomes contain interspersed repetitive sequence
              elements that derive from the reverse flow of genetic information. These
              retrotransposons can be of two classes based upon whether they contain or lack
              long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences similar to those found in retroviruses.
              The chicken repeat 1 (CR1) elements are non-LTR retrotransposons and encodes
              its own reverse transcriptase. Sequence homology to elements found in fish,
              frogs, reptiles and, perhaps, mammals suggest that these elements are the
              prototype for a superfamily of non-LTR retrotransposons that exist in multiple
              vertebrate classes. Full-length elements for two distinct subfamilies of CR1
              elements will be isolated and characterized. It will be determined if the CR1
              reverse transcriptase is functional and avian and non-avian cell cultures will
              be assayed for CR1 retrotransposition events.  %%%  Retrotransposons are a
              major source of mutations in lower eukaryotes such as yeast and Drosophila and
              are implicated in several human genetic disorders. They also contribute to
              genome instability in other ways, for example, as targets for non-reciprocal
              homologous recombination events. This work will contribute to insight into the
              mechanisms and sequences required for the transposition of an evolutionary
              successful non-LTR element, CR1.
