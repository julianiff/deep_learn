Abstract    :
              The purpose of this proposal is to develop a plan for new information on trends
              in employment status of new scientists and engineers in six professions based
              on information collected by professional associations.  the Commission has
              established important linkages with professional associations that can be used
              to develop standard statistical sources.  the data collected would provide
              feedback to policymakers, faculty, and students.  It would assess the quality
              of information on employment of graduates of several professions, improve and
              coordinate the data collection methods of professional societies, and
              disseminate the results via electronic means.
