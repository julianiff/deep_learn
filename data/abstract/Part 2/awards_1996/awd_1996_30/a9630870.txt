Abstract    :
              This research will investigate a novel VLSI arithmetic design approach using 
              reconfigurable architectures with shift switching, aimed at achieving an 
              innovative design methodology which could lead to a substantial improvement on 
              both speeds and areas for several arithmetic devices including parallel
              counters,  parallel compressors, parallel multipliers, precharged CMOS
              adders/comparators,  prefix parallel counters, as well as elementary function
              evaluations.  The  proposed technique will employ enhanced reconfigurable
              buses, i.e., buses  containing shift switches with buffers properly inserted.
              It possesses the  following new features.  First, when specified digital
              signals are propagating  through shift switching buses, the desired modulo
              operations can be performed  directly, which simplifies the traditional model
              of this basic arithmetic  computation. Second, after passing through each shift
              switch, the state signals  are inverted alternatively in two mutually inverted
              forms (n and p), which  minimizes the load of transistors and maximizes the
              speed of circuits. The  research will focus on the development of enhanced
              reconfigurable bus-based VLSI  schemes for important arithmetic operations. 
              The goals are to investigate:  1. shift switching parallel compressors and
              conditional compressors;   2. efficient partial product reduction schemes;  3.
              application-specific array processors for realization of some optimal 
              arithmetic algorithms;  4. various shift switching parallel counter schemes and
              their applications;   5. shift switching with precharge CMOS domino logic and
              its applications in  designing arithmetic devices and asynchronous arithmetic
              devices.
