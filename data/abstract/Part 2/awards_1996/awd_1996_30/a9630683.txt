Abstract    :
                          9630683  Florant    Dr. Florant proposes to study the physiological
              processes that affect and may ultimately regulate energy balance and
              thermoregulatory behavior in mammals that hibernate.  He will investigate how
              diet manipulations alter lipid storage during hibernation.  He will also test
              the hypothesis that essential fatty acids (EFA) play a pivotal role in
              maintaining thermoregulation during hibernation.  The results of these studies
              will lead to a  better understanding of how the diet influences cell membrane
              structure and function as well as the importance of lipids in physiology and
              behavior.    ??
