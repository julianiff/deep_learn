Abstract    :
              9630116  Robert P. Moses    The Algebra Project (AP) is a middle school project
              designed to significantly increase the proportion of students who complete
              algebra successfully in late middle school or high school, and who enter
              college preparatory mathematics studies.  This NSF project will engage
              approximately 500 grade 5-8 teachers over a four year period in 3 rural sites
              in the Delta area of Mississippi, Jackson, MS, Cambridge, MA, and New York, NY.
               Teachers will participate in a minimum of 128 hours of enhancement starting
              with a 2-week summer workshop in the AP materials and pedagogy.  These
              inquiry-based materials are designed as a supplement to other standards-based
              middle school curricula.  Over the next two school years, teachers will
              participate in 34 hours per year of follow-up workshops and mentoring from AP
              trainers in their own classroom.  The teacher development activities will be
              guided by a Site Professional Development Team, which includes a
              mathematician/mathematics educator, AP trainers, and site teachers.  The AP
              activity at each site includes community development work to deepen community
              commitment to mathematics education reform for underrepresented students in the
              mathematics and science career education path.  The project will also begin to
              document and research the effects of community development work.  The project
              is funded at 4-year project is funded by NSF at $2,503,748 with auditable
              cost-sharing of $1,739,699.  This project is connected to a $12,000,000 award
              from the Open Society Institute of the Soros Foundations.
