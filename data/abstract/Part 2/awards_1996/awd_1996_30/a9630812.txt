Abstract    :
              9630812  Bailey-Serres  The Department of Botany and Plant Sciences, University
              of California, Riverside (UCR) will hold a winter symposium, entitled "A Look
              Beyond Transcription: Mechanisms Determining mRNA Stability and Translation in
              Plants," January 16-19, 1997.  The objective of the 1997 symposium is to
              facilitate the first meeting in the plant field devoted to analysis of
              posttranscriptional processes from pre-mRNA processing through translation. 
              The symposium will highlight basic genetic mechanisms, as well as the role of
              posttranscriptional control during development and in response to environment
              stimuli. The basic understanding of posttranscriptional mechanisms will
              continue to prove useful in the genetic engineering of regulatable transgenes
              in plants.  The meeting will include six sessions with five to six speakers,
              and two Keynote addresses by individuals in the animal field. The presented
              papers will be published.  ***
