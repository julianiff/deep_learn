Abstract    :
                This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
              from Stanford University.  The project is to study the role of popular music in
              defining the self-identity of young people in Trinidad.  Calypso music has
              always played a central role in expressing popular social concerns in the
              country's history, from independence through its current position as an
              underdeveloped node in a transnational flow of people and resources.  Using
              ethnographic techniques of participant observation and intensive interviewing,
              as well as drawing upon the results of a random survey of 850 households in
              Trinidad and extensive demographic data on music listenership by location, age,
              gender, socio-economic status and ethnicity, the student will document what
              music means to the `oil boom` (1970s to early 1980s) generation of young
              adults.  The project will investigate the variation according to race, class
              and gender in how people listen to and participate in popular music.  The
              project will analyze changes in the musical styles (some seen as more
              `escapist`, others as more `political` or `roots oriented`), audience
              reactions, and the general social and cultural antecedents to musical
              production.   This project is important because is will advance our
              understanding of how locally produced music draws on a global set of sources to
              become meaningful to diverse communities.  Given the enormous growth in
              importance of popular music as a source of identity for young people in the
              contemporary world, this case study will produce a valuable advance in our
              knowledge about the meaning of music for young people.   In addition this
              project will add to our society's expertise about this important region of the
              world.
