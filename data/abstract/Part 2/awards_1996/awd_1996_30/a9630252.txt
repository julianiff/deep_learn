Abstract    :
              Mackenzie   9630252  A mutation in the mitochondra of the common bean, Phaseolus
              vulgaris, results in male sterility. The mutation is dominant, non-lethal and
              can be suppressed by nuclear genome suppressors. A mitochondrial
              sterility-associated protein, designated pvsORF239, is found only in
              reproductive tissues of the male-sterile plant localized to the pollen wall. It
              appears to be posttranslationally regulated. The possibility that, by virtue of
              specific characteristics found in this protein, it is actively transported from
              the mitochondrion to the callose layer of the developing pollen will be
              investigated by genetic methodology. Other aspects to be investigated are the
              possible involvement of a mitochondrial protease in the rapid turnover of the
              protein in the mitochondria of vegetative tissues and the function of nuclear
              suppressors, if any, in either the transport or turnover of the protein. In
              order to pursue these questions in a more tractable organism, the system will
              be introduced into yeast for further study.  %%%  This investigation of the
              cytoplasmic male sterility system in common bean will give added insight into
              our limited understanding of mitochondrial export mechanisms, the
              tissue-specific regulation of plant mitochondrial gene expression and the
              molecular basis of nuclear suppression of a mitochondrially-induced phenotype.
