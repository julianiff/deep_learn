Abstract    :
              9630187  Konig      The goal of this research project is to elucidate the
              molecular basis  regulating interactions between the T cell coreceptor CD4 and
              molecules  encoded by the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC Class
              II).  The CD4 glycoprotein interacts with the same MHC class II molecule as the
               antigen specific T cell receptor, and regulates intrathymic T cell  selection
              and activation of mature T cells.  The contribution of the  interaction between
              CD4 and MHC class II molecules to intracellular signal  transduction via the
              antigen specific T cell receptor (TCR) is not known,  however the engagement of
              CD4 by MHC class II molecules contributes  quantitatively and qualitatively to
              the activation of T cells.  This  project will test the hypothesis that antigen
              specific T cell receptor  mediated signal transduction depends on the
              structured and sequential  oligomerization of TCR, CD4 and MHC class II
              molecules.  The PI has  developed assays that measure adhesion of CD4+ T cells
              to MHC class II  cells and to purified MHC class II molecules.  Binding data
              will be  correlated with antigen induced T cell responses.  Mutations have been
               introduced into MHC class II molecules to define regions that mediate the 
              interaction with CD4.  Mutant MHC class II molecules will be combined with  CD4
              molecules having mutations in identified MHC class II binding regions  to
              define the interface formed by interacting CD4 and MHC class II molecules. 
              Results from these experiments will enhance our understanding of structure- 
              function relationships responsible for important immune regulatory mechanisms.
