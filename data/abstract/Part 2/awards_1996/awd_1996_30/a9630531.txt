Abstract    :
              9630531 Hedin    Mechanisms of Base Cation Cycling in Forest Biogeochemical
              Systems: Application of a New Tool    A priority for research in the field of
              biogeochemistry in the U.S. and other industrial nations is to understand how
              modern human activities are affecting the integrity and stability of natural
              ecosystems.  It is particularly urgent to understand how forest resources are
              affected, as indicated by recent scientific reports of increasing degradation
              in forest health in some areas of North America and Europe, including instances
              of  "forest decline."  One of the most important needs for predicting the
              status of  forests over the next century is an improved understanding of how
              humans are perturbing the natural pathways by which forests feed on mineral
              nutrients (so called "base cations").  Over the past two years, a new technique
              has been developed that uses non-radioactive stable isotopes of  strontium
              (isotope 84) to directly trace how forest nutrition is affected by human
              activities.  This research applies this new application to forest ecosystems
              where human impacts have been minimal to better understand the sources of base
              cations and how these materials are utilized and cycled.
