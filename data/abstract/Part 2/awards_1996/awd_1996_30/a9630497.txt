Abstract    :
                                                        The objective of the research is the
              development of new methods for  jointly analyzing cryoelectron microscopy (EM)
              and solution x-ray  scattering data in order to determine the 3D structure of
              spherical  viruses. Research in this area is timely because improved
              microscopes  and cryo EM techniques are increasing the flow of images while 
              synchrotrons and associated low-angle scattering beam lines allow the 
              measurement of qualitatively superior solution x-ray scattering data.  The
              joint use of both types of data is a natural approach because of  compensating
              strengths and weaknesses.  For instance, cryo EM images  depend on unknown
              orientation parameters while solution x-ray  scattering data does not.    There
              are two major themes that extend through the work:  a new model  for the
              scattering density of the particle and a unified way of  combining the model
              with all of the experimental data in order to  reconstruct the particle.  The
              purpose of the model is to precisely  and concisely describe the particle.  In
              particular, the proposed  model enforces the finite real-space extent of the
              particle, allows  more than one type of symmetry to exist with an individual
              particle,  has few parameters, and is mathematically simple in both real and 
              reciprocal space.
