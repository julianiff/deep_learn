Abstract    :
              9630794  Bujarski     The molecular mechanisms of RNA recombination in RNA
              viruses using brome mosaic virus(BMV) as a model system will be investigated.
              BMV mutants isolated and characterized during the tenure of the previous award
              has demonstrated that replication and recombination functions can be unlinked.
              As an approach to understanding how BMV proteins participate in nonhomologous
              heteroduplex-mediated recombination, we will 1. analyze the involvement of the
              1a helicase domain in recombination, 2. analyze the involvement of RNA
              polymerase (2a protein) core domain in recombination and 3. study the role of
              the N-domain of the 2a protein in recombination.  %%%  Only a limited amount of
              information concerning the mechanisms involved in non-homologous RNA-RNA
              recombination is available. Such recombination plays a key role in RNA virus
              genome plasticity, as it can lead to the generation of new virus strains and
              species. An understanding of the basic mechanisms of RNA-RNA recombination will
              provide valuable insight into viral evolution and diversity and could provide
              important practical information which could be used for applied goals.  ***
