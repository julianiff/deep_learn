Abstract    :
                    9630195  Pratt  Because plants are immobile and also depend upon sunlight
              as their source of useful free energy, it is important that they be able to
              modify their growth and development in accordance with their ambient light
              environment.  It is therefore reasonable that plants have evolved a number of
              photosensory pigments, among which the phytochromes are the best understood. 
              The focus of this research is on the properties and function of a newly
              discovered phytochrome, phyF.  Specific objectives focus on two general goals. 
              Firstly, and most importantly, the function(s) of phyF will be identified and
              related to those of other phytochromes.  Secondly, key physicochemical
              properties of phyF will be identified as a prelude to understanding its
              immediate, molecular mode of action.  Collectively, this work will provide a
              relatively complete picture of this newly discovered phytochrome and will form
              the basis not only for future investigations directed towards elucidating its
              immediate mode of action and its structure/function relationships, but also for
              exploiting its potential for crop improvement.
