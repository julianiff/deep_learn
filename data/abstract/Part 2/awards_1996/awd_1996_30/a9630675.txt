Abstract    :
              96-30675  D'Eustachio    Progression of eukaryotic cells through the cell cycle,
              except at the onset of embryonic development, is regulated by checkpoints: at
              initiation of DNA replication, and entry into and exit from mitosis. Ran, a
              small GTP-binding and -hydrolyzing protein, modulates several aspects of the
              cell cycle progression, presumably by linking them through the intracellular
              trafficking of macromolecules. Ran BP1 and Ran GAP/Rna1 attenuate the Ran
              GTPase switch. The genes that encode these proteins have been cloned and
              sequenced and functional defects of these proteins have been identified in
              vivo. The Ran GTPase has been linked to the regulation of mRNA export from the
              nucleus. This activity of Ran GTPase is regulated by RanBP1. The goals of this
              project are: to characterize the interactions of RanBP1 with Ran and with
              RanGAP/Rna1 in vitro, using wild-type and mutated RanBP1; to identify
              additional proteins that interact with the switch through RanBP1 and
              RanGAP/Rna1, using the yeast interaction trap system; and to define functions
              of RanBP1 domains in vivo by characterizing the phenotypes of fission yeast
              strains whose wild-type RanBP1 genes have been replaced by mutant constructs.

              controls the progression of the cell cycle.   ***
