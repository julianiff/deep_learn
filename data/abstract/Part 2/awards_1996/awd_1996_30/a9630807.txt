Abstract    :
              9630807  Hicks    In contrast to the completely divided heart of birds and
              mammals, the heart of non-crocodilian reptiles (turtles, snakes and lizards) is
              made up of a single ventricle. This anatomical arrangement results in the
              mixing of oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood within the heart (cardiac
              shunting). Historically, this was viewed as an intermediate evolutionary step
              that was thought to be inferior compared to the circulation of birds and
              mammals. This perception changed in the later half of this century when studies
              showed that the amount of cardiac shunting is probably regulated and that
              cardiac shunts may provide several unique physiological advantages to reptiles.
              However, this notion of the reptilian circulation is based on a relatively
              small number of observations during specific types of behaviors or
              physiological states, for example during breathing. Utilizing technological
              advances in miniature blood flow measuring devices and computer assisted data
              collection systems, this research will measure a variety of    physiological
              states including terrestrial locomotion, swimming, digestion and during periods
              of rest. This research provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine
              cardiac shunting patterns in reptiles during a variety of behaviors and
              physiological challenges and will make significant advancement towards
              understanding their unique cardiovascular "design".
