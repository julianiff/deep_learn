Abstract    :
              ***  9660044  Muzio     This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project
              involves the development of an enhanced micromixed natural gas combustion
              process. This novel combustion process provides the opportunity for a burner
              fuel/air mixing system to approach the performance of a premixed combustion
              system. This has two major implications in terms of benefits. First, it
              provides a means to approach very low NOX levels by not only controlling
              thermal NOX formation, but also minimizing prompt NOX formation. This is key to
              achieving ultra low NOX performance (i.e., less than 10 ppm). The proposed
              concept involves a novel approach to provide micromixing of fuel and air in
              order to achieve ultra low NOx emissions (i.e., less than 10 ppm).             
               If successful this project should provide a cost effective alternative to NOX
              emission reduction.  ***
