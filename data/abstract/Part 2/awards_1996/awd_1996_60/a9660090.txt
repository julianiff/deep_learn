Abstract    :
              ***  9660090  Genders          This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will study the electrochemical synthesis of propylene oxide. This
              proposal describes novel composite electrode structures that are expected to
              offer a low cost route to the electrosynthesis of propylene oxide. The primary
              focus of the proposal will be on the electrochemical epoxidation of propylene
              to form propylene oxide. The incorporation of specific electrocatalyts into
              high surface area electrodes will be examined. The techniques used are also
              expected to be of general use in other epoxidation reactions.      Propylene
              oxide production represents an annual market value of $2 billion in the US
              alone.  A new low cost route to propylene oxide and/or propylene glycol would
              have significant economic benefit.  In addition to the commodity market, an
              electrochemical route to propylene oxide will also offer a cost effective
              method for smaller scale on-site manufacturing.  ***
