Abstract    :
              ***  9660741  Sperl     It is expected that the Clean Air Act of 1990 will
              significantly restrict, and perhaps prohibit, the use of many industrial
              solvents.  The emphasis thus shifts to the production of environmentally benign
              or "green solvents", which may be synthesized from current petrochemical
              sources or derived from renewable resources.  Solvents may be produced
              biologically from the components of synthesis and waste gases.  Preliminary
              studies in the laboratories of Bioengineering Resources, Inc. have resulted in
              the identification of bacteria which produce butanediol and n-butanol from CO
              and H2.  The purpose of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              to be carried out by Bioengineering Resources, Inc. is to obtain CO-utilizing
              bacteria from natural sources capable of producing solvents form CO, CO2, and
              H2.  The project will focus on bacterial cultures that produce individual
              ketones or diols, but also will include alcohols, such as isopropanol or
              isobutanol, if superior cultures for alcohol production are found.  Isolates
              from natural inocula will then be developed for the ability to produce ketones
              and diols.  The best organisms will be studied in continuous culture to define
              reaction kinetics.  The design and economics of a commercial facility will be
              projected to determine technical and economic feasibility.  The next phase of
              the project will seek to optimize the biological process by performing advanced
              culture screening, reactor, and process analysis studies.   The proposed
              technology has commercial potential because it would simultaneously constitute
              a response to environmental pressures and meet the solvent demand.  That is, if
              this technology for the production of "green solvents" from waste gases or from
              municipal solid waste (MSW) by gasification and fermentation is successful, it
              could help to alleviate the problem of MSW disposal while at the same time
              producing industrial solvents such as butanediol and n-butanol.  ***
