Abstract    :
              ***  9660411  Milde    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project 
              to be carried out by Ion Physics Corporation will investigate a new method for
              disinfection of water supplies, particularly with respect to the pathogen
              cryptosporidium parvum.  This microbe is not adequately controlled by
              conventional treatment procedures (e.g., chlorination and filtration).  The
              proposed method neither requires the addition of chemicals or of any substance,
              nor does it utilize radiation--such as UV or X-rays--electrical discharges, or
              high-energy particle beams.  The process is very fast and its action is
              confined to a small processing chamber which is within a segment of pipe.  The
              Phase I work will develop a suitable apparatus for experiments with a
              continuous, flowing stream of water, and will apply this to water inoculated
              with oocysts of cryptosporidium parvum.  It will entail a preliminary
              investigation of the effect of process parameters.  Using results obtained from
              this work, the practical potential for this method will be evaluated and
              compared to alternative methods.  It is anticipated that the Phase I work will
              demonstrate its cost-effectiveness and the capability of reducing microbe
              populations by a factor of 1,000 or more.   The proffered technology will be of
              utility to the disinfection of drinking water supplies, beverages, and other
              liquid foods; control of yeasts and bacteria in brewing and wine-making; and
              control of microbes in waste water and other effluents.  ***
