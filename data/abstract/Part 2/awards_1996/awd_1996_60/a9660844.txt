Abstract    :
              ***  96-60844  Yang    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will investigate low-cost processing of superalloys.  Materials such as
              superalloys have commercially desirable properties for applications in extreme
              environments.  Unfortunately, these materials are often unaffordable primarily
              because of the inherent difficulty in forming and shaping these materials into
              useful components.  Phase I will explore a concept that superalloys can be
              readily processed into useful shapes.  Phase II would optimize the technology
              and produce prototypes of commercial interest.  Commercial applications are
              expected in widespread use of superalloys in advanced structural tools,
              transportation engine components, magnetohydrodynamic components, stress-prone
              high temperature parts (for armaments, nozzles, and combustion chambers), and
              corrosion-prone health care component, such as implants.  ***
