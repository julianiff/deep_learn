Abstract    :
              ***  9660116  Bayless     This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I
              project will provide a preliminary demonstration of the feasibility of a novel
              plasma source for advanced semiconductor processing.  There is a major need for
              improved low pressure/high density plasma sources which are scaleable to large
              areas with precisely controlled and uniform plasma density profiles.  The
              proposed Rotating-Field Plasma Source (RFPS) is a new type of source which is
              expected to meet the demanding requirements for etching and processing at
              feature sizes <0.5  m.  The RFPS relies on a novel high-frequency rotating
              magnetic field drive concept to generate and shape the plasma density in a way
              that will not be affected by insertion of semiconductor wafers.  It is expected
              to operate over a pressure range of O.1-lO mtorr with reactive gases.  The
              specific objectives of Phase I are to: (1) design and assemble a Phase I RFPS
              feasibility experiment; (2) perform experiments to demonstrate plasma
              generation with controlled uniformity; and (3) develop the conceptual design
              for a laboratory prototype RFPS system to be operated in a commercial etching
              system in Phase II.  A major dry etch equipment supplier has expressed great
              interest in the RFPS concept and will participate in Phase I.  This project
              contributes to National Critical Technologies in the Microelectronics and
              Optoelectronics area.   This project will provide a superior method for
              generating well controlled plasmas for a wide range of semiconductor materials
              processing applications.  The RFPS advantages include:  (1) scaleable to wafer
              diameters of >400 mm with good uniformity;  (2) excellent controllability;  and
              (3) low capitol and maintenance costs.  This source will substantially enhance
              the competitiveness of the U.S. semiconductor industry.  ***
