Abstract    :
              ***  96-60730  Baum        This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research
              project will achieve chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of copper (Cu) and
              copper-alloy films  via thermal decomposition of bimetallic, single source
              precursors. A novel class of bimetallic single source Cu(1)(13-diketonato)
              complexes will be synthesized, characterized and optimized for CVD film growth
              of doped copper films (alloys). Both the Lewis base, which contains the second
              metal center, and 13-diketonate ligand identity will be altered to "tailor" the
              precursor properties for the deposition of high-purity copper alloy films. The
              copper complexes will be studied to correlate structure -property relationships
              and utility for CVD. Using this approach, conformal, doped Cu films can be
              explored as high-performance interconnects in integrated circuits. A CVD
              metallization process for the deposition of copper alloys will provide a
              mechanism for the formation of high performance integrated circuits. Using low
              resistivity interconnects, in tandem with low dielectric constant materials,
              provides a pathway to superior device performance. Further, copper alloys can
              dramatically improve both the electromigration and thermal stability of the
              submicron sized interconnects. In Phase II, collaboration with a major IC
              manufacturer and CVD tool vendor will be used to evaluate the commercial
              potential of the interconnect process.    This Phase I research will facilitate
              fabrication of high performance logic and memory devices.  World-wide
              commercialization in Phase III is expected to impact a sizeable market.
