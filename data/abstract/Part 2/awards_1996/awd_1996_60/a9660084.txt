Abstract    :
              ***  96-60084  Zamansky     Prospective technologies for stationary
              post-combustion NOX control include: Selective NonCatalytic Reduction (SNCR),
              Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), and reburning. SNCR and SCR reduce NOX by
              non-catalytic or catalytic reactions with N-agents (ammonia or urea). There are
              several problems with SCR, such as high capital cost, limited catalyst life,
              catalyst poisoning and disposal. SNCR is less expensive, but capabilities of
              SNCR are limited by the narrow temperature window of NOX control, ammonia slip,
              low utilization of N-agents, and formation of N2O with urea injection.
              Conventional natural gas reburning is currently a mature technology for NOX
              control. Reburning has been successfully demonstrated at full scale by EER and
              others on numerous occasions. However, reburning alone provides about 60% NOz
              reduction and cannot achieve 80% required by ozone attainment regulations in
              certain geographic areas. The proposed project is directed towards improving
              performance of the reburning process by injection of air in the reburning zone
              under specific conditions. The goal of the project is to achieve 80% NOX
              removal by the Air Promoted Reburning (ARP) process. In a combination with
              other inexpensive NOX control methods (such as low NOz burners and SNCR), the
              APR process will make it possible to reduce NOX by 90+%.  ***
