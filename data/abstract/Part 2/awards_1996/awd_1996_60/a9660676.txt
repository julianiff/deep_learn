Abstract    :
                 A number of approaches have been employed for the inactivation or removal of
              viruses in therapeutic proteins derived from human plasma. These techniques are
              not always effective against a wide spectrum of human and animal viruses, are
              encumbered by process specific deficiencies, and often result in denaturation
              of the biologicals which they are designed to protect. Some of these methods
              are effective in inactivating enveloped viruses, such as HIV, but none are
              effective against non enveloped viruses such as HAV. Aphios has developed a
              rapid and generally applicable virus inactivation technique for both enveloped
              and non enveloped viruses based on supercritical fluid technology. In the
              proposed effort, we plan to enhance this technique by utilizing a constant,
              discharging or varying electrical field.   The worldwide marketplace for human
              plasma and animal serum products is estimated to be S15 to S20 billion by the
              year 2000. The potential viral inactivation marketplace is estimated to be
              about 5% of this malt, approximately $0.7S to $1.0 billion. Combined demand for
              these therapeutics (fresh frozen plasma, fibrin glue, immunoglobulins) as well
              as transgenic proteins and recombinant therapeutics from mammalian cell culture
              will increase marketplace size and demand for cost efficient and generally
              applicable virus inactivation technology.
