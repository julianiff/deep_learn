Abstract    :
              9660861  Jackiw       This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              builds on the success of The Geometer's Sketchpad, a piece of educational
              software that has had an important impact on the teaching and learning of
              mathematics in secondary schools.  The research will prototype a next
              generation of this software--3-D Sketchpad--an integrated exploratory
              environment for creating, analyzing, and investigating three- and
              higher-dimensional mathematics.  The Geometer's Sketchpad allows users to carry
              out geometric constructions using standard 2-D tools and transformations
              (Euclid's compass and straightedge tools augmented by reflection, rotation, and
              dilation).  At any time, users may drag one or more objects in the sketch using
              the computer's mouse, and all of the other objects will dynamically adjust
              their position and size to maintain the constructed relationships.  This simple
              idea has profound implications in the teaching and learning of mathematics. 
              Generalized to three dimensions, the revolution in geometry education brought
              about by Sketchpad has the opportunity to broaden the geometry curriculum and
              to extend its relevance to other areas in mathematics and science.  The
              objectives of this Phase I research project are to design and prototype
              critical elements of 3D Sketchpad and to describe and prototype the support
              materials that will ease its introduction into classrooms.  The Geometer's
              Sketchpad has enjoyed substantial commercial success.  If the proposed research
              meets its goals, the resulting software and support materials will have even
              greater application in middle schools, secondary schools, and colleges.
