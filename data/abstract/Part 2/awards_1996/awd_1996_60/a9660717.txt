Abstract    :
              ***  96-0717  Wong      This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project
              will develop a method of producing fine, uniform tantalum (Ta) filaments, using
              technology originally developed for superconductors, and determine the
              performanceof these filaments in electrolytic capacitors. Existing Ta powders
              used for capacitors have demonstrated increasing specific capacitance as the
              manufacturers have improved the sodium reduction process. However the new
              powders are more sensitive to capacitor production process parameters such as
              sintering time and temperature and forming voltage. This forces a compromise in
              the final capacitor between capacitance level and negative performance criteria
              such as operation voltage, leakage, breakdown voltage, and equivalent series
              resistance. In addition, the new powders are much more expensive due to the
              lower production yields. The performance of the Ta filaments is expected to
              meet or exceed that of commercially available powder without any of the
              performance drawbacks such as sensitivity to sintering temperature or forming
              voltage while promising higher yields and lower costs.      The Ta filaments
              have the ability to address a sizable Ta powder market for electrolytic
              capacitors.  ***
