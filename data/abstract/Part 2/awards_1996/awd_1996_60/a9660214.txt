Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9660214  Kumar      This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project evaluates the feasibility of creating a generic, user-friendly
              optimal robotic trajectory planning software that is robust, fully automated,
              and capable of multi-degree-of-freedom optimization with path constraints.
              Currently, no commercial software exists which can solve generic robot
              optimization problems in a turn-key fashion. A differential inclusions
              technique recently developed at Analytical Mechanics Associates (AMA) is
              ideally suited to solve the robot trajectory optimization problem because the
              controls appear linearly. Proving concept feasibility implies: (a) construction
              of a generalized symbolic algorithm that creates the equations of motion of
              multi-degree-of-freedom manipulators from user-provided mass and geometry data;
              (b) representation of above equations in the differential inclusion format; (c)
              evaluation of analytical partial derivatives of the resulting hodograph,
              boundary, and path constraints with respect to the generalized states; (d)
              evaluation of convergence robustness of the differential inclusion approach for
              the entire class of open-chain manipulators and comparison to classical
              variational and collocation techniques; and (e) obtaining optimal solutions for
              high-degree-of-freedom manipulators via a special dense-sparse discretization
              approach.   Commercial applications include performance enhancement of
              manufacturing processes such as spot welding, painting, and assembly, where
              minimizing time and energy requirements map into millions of dollars saved in
              direct manufacturing costs. ***
