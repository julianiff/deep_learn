Abstract    :
              ***  96-60771  Steinbeck      This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research
              project will produce a new magnetic materials system which would revolutionize
              integrated magnetic and magnetoelectromechanical devices. The materials system
              uses the shape anisotropy of nanorods to engineer the magnetic properties of
              bulk magnetic materials. Using the shape anisotropy the magnetization of
              Supermalloy nanorods can be made to lie normal to the plane of a thin film.
              These vertically magnetized films can be used for a wide range of applications
              as planar integrated inductors, transformers, microwave circulators and
              electromagnetic cores. The nanorods are buried in an insulating matrix which
              will allow metallic nanorods to be useful in applications at rf frequencies by
              dramatically reducing eddy current losses. By adjusting the aspect ratio of the
              nanorods the coercive force of the rods may be varied by several orders of
              magnitude while leaving the remnant magnetization unaffected from the bulk
              material value. Phase I will demonstrate that Supermalloy nanorods can be made
              with the desired magnetic properties. Phase II will demonstrate that this novel
              materials system can be used to build engineered magnetic laminates with
              properties superior to bulk magnetic materials for device applications.    The
              proposed magnetic materials have a wide range of applications in rf and power
              transformers as well as microwave circulators.  Laminates of these materials
              could build a new generation of high performance magnetic components.   ***
