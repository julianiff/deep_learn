Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9660782  Steinbeck      This Small Business Innovation
              Research Phase I program will investigate a novel nanomagnetic memory device
              which has performance characteristics similar to those of SHAM. Nanomagnetic
              structures are used to store data and to nondestructively read data out of the
              device using a fluxgate mechanism. The memory cells are passive devices which
              do not require transistors to be integrated at each memory cell and are built
              using proven semiconductor thin film techniques. Arrays of the nanomagnetic
              memory devices can be made at areal data storage densities comparable to hard
              disk drives. The thin film processes used to build the device coupled with the
              passive nature of the memory cells may make true 3-D integration of the devices
              possible as both 3-D memory arrays and as memory arrays integrated on top of
              logic circuits. This Phase I program will demonstrate that nanomagnetic memory
              arrays can be built at areal data storage densities of 100 Mbit/cm2. The Phase
              II program will be used to build a complete 1K, 100 Mbit/cm2 memory device.  
              Nanomagnetic memory technology could revolutionize the way memory subsystems
              are incorporated into electronic systems. One very exciting possibility is for
              full "systems on a chip" to become cost effective due to the preservation of
              silicon "real estate" made possible by this new memory technology. ***
