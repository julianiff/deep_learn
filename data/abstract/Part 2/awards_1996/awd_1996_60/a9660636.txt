Abstract    :
                       This proposal addresses the one-step direct electrochemical synthesis
              of propylene oxide from propylene/oxygen mixtures and a bifunctional
              electrocatalyst for simultaneously generating hydrogen peroxide and epoxidizing
              olefins. The ability to in situ electrochemically generate hydrogen peroxide
              allows for the precise control of its local concentration and the resultant
              enhancement of selectivity to propylene oxide. The proposed approach will also
              allow for direct removal of product through a membrane semipermeable to
              propylene oxide. Hydrogen peroxide electrogeneration will be catalyzed by
              either gold or a supported metallomacrocycle (Ni-phthalocyanine or
              Comeso-tetraphenylporphyrin). Propylene epoxidation will be catalyzed by
              Mn-meso-tetraphenylporphyrin or titanium silcalite. Successful completion of
              the program will result in a selective, high yield process for the epoxidation
              of olefins.        The technology developed in this program should provide a
              significantly lower cost route to olefin epoxides using in situ
              electrochemically generated hydrogen peroxide and should be of great interest
              to manufacturers of these types of materials.
