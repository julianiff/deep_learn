Abstract    :
              ***  9660415  Mayer   Attention has only recently be given to the widespread
              problem of pesticide contaminants.  This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will test a novel method for removing pesticides from
              contaminated soils.  Current methods for handling pesticide-contaminated soils
              include disposal in hazardous landfills, which because of volume can be costly,
              or land farming, which may impact future land use due to incompatible mixtures
              and/or high concentrations of pesticides.  Western Environmental Services &
              Technology, Inc. (WEST) is proposing the use of "subcritical" water to extract
              pesticides from soil.  Water can be changed from a highly polar to nonpolar
              solvent by simply increasing temperature under a few bars of pressure.  While
              steam and supercritical water (T>374 C and P>221 bar) have been studied, hot
              liquid-phase water ("subcritical" water) has received very little attention as
              a solvent for organic compounds.  By heating water under low pressure (to
              maintain a liquid state), solubilities of nonpolar organics can be dramatically
              increased.  In preliminary laboratory studies, it has been demonstrated that
              subaritical water can be used as an analytical technique for extracting polar
              as well as nonpolar organics from a variety of solid matrices.  WEST will test
              the concept of subcritical water extraction of pesticides on actual samples of
              contaminated soil.   The proposed technology has the potential to provide a
              cost-effective and environmentally acceptable method for remediating
              contaminated soils.  Numerous other applications of this technology may be
              possible, including polychlorinated biphenols (PCBs), chlorinated solvents,
              waste munitions, polyaromated halogens (PAHs), and petroleum spills.  ***
