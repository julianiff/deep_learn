Abstract    :
              ***  96-60897     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              develop a unique analytical instrument in which two types of surface analysis -
              sputter-initiated laser resonance ionization spectroscopy (SIRIS) and
              time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) - can be carried out
              simultaneously, without sacrificing the performance of either. The SIRIS
              selective laser post-ionization provides high efficiency and excellent sample
              utilization with much less matrix effects and mass interferences than SIMS or
              most other mass analysis methods. This leads to high sensitivity in small
              volumes (e.g. particulates), high dynamic range, and good quantitation for a
              wide range of elements. The principal drawback is that SIRIS analyzes for only
              one element at a time. In comparison, the nonselective surface ionization of
              conventional TOF-SIMS has proven to be extremely useful for multielement
              characterization. By integrating TOF-SIMS with SIRIS, the combined instrument
              will enable the best of both technologies; high sensitivity and sample
              utilization with negligible matrix effects analysis and insignificant
              interferences for single-element trace analysis, and multielement material
              characterization from TOF-SIMS.    With this combination of capabilities in a
              single instrument costing close to a stand alone TOF-SIMS or SIRIS, a
              SIRIS/TOF-SIMS instrument will become a significant contribution to the next
              generation of TOF mass spectrometry instrumentation.  ***
