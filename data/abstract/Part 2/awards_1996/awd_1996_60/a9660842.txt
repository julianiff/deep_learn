Abstract    :
              ***  9660842  Squillante     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will develop a solid state, large area, high resolution imaging
              detector by combining the semiconductor film (lead iodide, PbI2) technology
              being developed by the firm with the large format amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)
              readout technology which has been developed by Xerox Palo Alto Research Center,
              a collaborator in the research.  Argonne National Laboratory will also
              collaborate in the effort and will be involved in developing low noise
              electronics for the detector as well as in conducting macromolecular
              diffraction studies.  Macromolecular crystallography is a very important
              technique for determining structures of complex biological systems such a
              proteins, nucleic acids, and viruses. Due to such research on atomic level, the
              understanding of important biological processes such as enzyme catalysis, viral
              infection, immune response, hereditary information encoding, and photosynthesis
              has increased considerably. Macromolecular crystallography in a typical
              laboratory setting is performed using a rotating-anode X-ray source and an
              imaging X-ray detector to record the diffraction pattern from various
              biological samples such as proteins and viruses.  Important requirements for
              the X-ray detectors used in such experiments include large area (>10 cm x 10
              cm), high resolution (100-200 um), wide dynamic range (104), high sensitivity,
              and low cost.  None of the existing detectors satisfy all requirements and have
              serious limitations in terms of permanence, size, or cost.  The goal of the
              Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach in
              meeting these requirements.     Potential commercial applications of the
              research include X-ray diffraction, nondestructive testing, mammography,
              radiology, X-ray astronomy and environmental studies.  ***
