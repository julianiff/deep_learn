Abstract    :
              ***  9660827  Finzer   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              to be carried out by Key Curriculum Press proposes to prototype and test
              software tools and curriculum resources for teachers and students to engage in
              data exploration, collaborative data gathering, and analysis among remote
              sites.  The new curriculum materials and Internet-based software tools will be
              integrated with the DataSpace (TM) computer learning environment for data
              analysis and statistics.  The new software will give learners direct access to
              data on the Internet, eliminating the downloading and importing processes. 
              With DataSpace, teachers and students will be able to publish new data sets on
              the Internet with a defined level of access read, add--to, or modify--by
              others.  The prototype curriculum materials will provide classroom-based
              examples of how to use these new capabilities.  Finally, the project will draft
              standards for storage of data sets on the Internet and begin discussion of such
              standards among interested organizations.   The proposed research will lead to
              significant enhancements to the DataSpace Software and additonal curriculum
              materials, all of which will be of great utility in the rapidly expanding
              secondary school statistics market.  The new curriculum materials based on
              networked collaboration and exploration of timely, remote data sets will be
              very attractive to teachers as they will provide highly motivated methods for
              teaching mathematics and statistics.  ***
