Abstract    :
              ***  9660755  Hannauer     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project is to develop and evaluate a promising new integration algorithm for
              solving stiff problems in real time. Such problems occur frequently in
              Aerospace, Chemical, Nuclear, Electric Power, and Automotive applications. In
              such applications, a common design technique is to combine a computer model of
              part of the system under evaluation (usually consisting of ordinary
              differential equations) with actual system hardware. Such "hardware in the
              loop" applications require real-time operation; the simulation of one second of
              system operation may take no more than one second of computer time. Some models
              contain very fast subsystems (e.g. a "tight" controller in a mechanical system
              or a small parasitic impedance in an electrical system). Such large eigenvalues
              (high frequencies, short time constants) require a very short computational
              step for stability. If the computer can't solve the entire set of system
              equations in this short time, real-time operation is impossible.  The proposed
              integration algorithm, called the LIMP (Linearized IMPlicit) method, allows
              much larger steps to be taken for a given system, enabling real-time solution
              of many previously "intractable" problems.   Potential commercial applications
              include the design of aircraft, missiles, chemical reactors,  power generators,
              and automobiles.  ***
