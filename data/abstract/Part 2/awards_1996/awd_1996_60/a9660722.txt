Abstract    :
              ***  96-60722  Heath    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will characterize and evaluate a 125-millimeter focal length, tandem
              Ebert-Fastie double monochromator in combination with a calibration transfer
              spectrometer which uses ultrastable nitrated silicon photodiodes in combination
              with ultra stable narrow-band, "hardened" (insensitive to environmental
              stresses of high temperature, humidity, and aging effects), ion-assisted
              deposition filters.  This double monochromator is a next-generation, moderate
              cost, ultraviolet (UV) surface radiation-monitoring instrument.  Phase I will
              also determine the transmittance stability of some current cosine receptors.   
              This double monochromator and calibration transfer standard spectroradiometer
              have potential uses as a field UV surface radiation and ozone monitoring
              instrument, as well as in the laboratory and industry where it can establish a
              common radiometric scale for spectral radiance and irradiance calibrations and
              provide precision laboratory spectroradiometric measurements.    ***
