Abstract    :
              ***  9660417  Jue    This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project
              will fabricate polycrystalline   t'-zirconia ceramics for advanced
              applications.  Polycrystalline t'-zirconia differs from regular tetragonal
              (t-phase) zirconia (TZP) in both fabrication procedure and properties.  TZP
              ceramics are sintered at ~1500(C, exhibit high strength, high toughness, but
              exhibit low creep resistance, and low temperature aging.  t'-zirconia are
              sintered at higher temperatures, exhibit moderate strength, high toughness,
              high creep resistance, and no low temperature aging.  Resistance to creep and
              low temperature aging makes t'-zirconia ceramics superior to TZP for many low
              and high temperature applications.  Polycrystalline t'-zirconia ceramics of a
              fine surface grain structure will be made by high temperature direct resistive
              heating above 2000(C and surface cooling.  Highly creep resistant, strong,
              tough and transformation-resistant zirconia ceramics will be fabricated in
              Phase I.  Heating elements of t'-zirconia will be fabricated and evaluated  
              The potential commercial applications of polycrystalline t'-zirconia ceramics
              include:  (1) heating elements for furnaces, (2) refractories, (3) kiln
              furniture, (4) liners for chemical reactors requiring resistance to attack by
              water, acids, alkalis, (5) storage heaters, (6) substrates for superconductors,
              and (7) structural components requiring high creep resistance.
