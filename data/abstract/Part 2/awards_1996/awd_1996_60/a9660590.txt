Abstract    :
              ***  9660590  Fatunmbi    The purpose of this proposal is to develop novel
              chromatographic stationary phases on   horizontally polymerized C18/C1
              monolayers. The new chromatographic stationary phase  has the potential to
              affect significantly both the performance and stability of commercial  columns
              for high-performance liquid chromatography. The novel phase provides 
              exceptionally low silanol activity and high hydrolytic stability, two critical
              features   that are unsatisfactory in presently available columns.     The
              commercial viability of these phases will be evaluated in a systematic  
              comparison to present commercial products with respect to chromatographic
              performance and   hydrolytic stability. This approach has the potential to
              provide new classes of stationary phases   that can be marketed through the
              leading chromatography companies.  ***
