Abstract    :
              ***  96-60609  Allred    This Small Business Innovation Research project will
              outline chemical strategies for "interfaces by design" to formulate new finish
              compositions that should vastly improve the performance of composite materials
              in high humidity or marine applications. Initial results from fiber finishes
              incorporating this novel chemistry suggests the possibility of advanced
              composites that offer not only moisture resistance, but an actual improvement
              of mechanical strength and fracture toughness following water exposure.
              Composite materials are universally affected by humidity or water immersion due
              primarily to the ingress of water at the fiber/matrix interface. Moisture
              degradation of composite properties remains a critical technology problem for
              these versatile  materials.    Advanced composite materials are finding
              increased usage in a growing range of applications. The more the engineering
              and fabrication properties of these materials are understood, the greater is
              the demand for them. As composite technology is applied to evermore new and
              demanding areas, further improvements  in performance are necessary while
              simultaneously reducing costs.  ??
