Abstract    :
              9460437  Schmidt   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project to be
              carried out by Cleveland Medical Devices will develop a wireless auditory
              transceiver that would translate and receive speech.  It could be used in a
              classroom or other environment.  Current assistive listening device (ALD)
              technology is limited to one-way reception of audio transmitted from a single
              source and amplified by a bulky device worn by the hearing impaired person. 
              This system should improve two-way communication among hearing impaired
              children and their teachers and classmates.  The unit should enhance
              communications for severely hearing impaired students within classrooms, small
              lab groups and math work groups, as well as individual instruction.   This
              project has the potential to benefit hearing impaired students in the
              classroom.  It will also allow family members to talk to hearing impaired
              individuals and to each other from anywhere in the house and assist hearing
              impaired individuals in hearing the TV, radio, phone, doorbell etc.  Moreover,
              it can serve many others in environments where auditory signals need to be
              enhanced and noise reduced.
