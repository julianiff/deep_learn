Abstract    :
                 This project will evaluate the quality and utility of RNA oligonucleotides
              synthesized using a novel chemical synthesis scheme. The growing interest in
              RNA structural components, ribazymes and other RNA functions has generated a
              need for reliable methods of synthesizing small RNA oligonucleotides (<50
              nucleotides). Although RNA synthesis can be accomplished for some applications
              via either biochemical methods, em. transcription, or chemically, e.g.
              5'-dimethoxytrityl-2'-silyl chemistry, there is a definite need for improved
              RNA synthesis methods.  Final processing of synthesized RNA must be done under
              mild, sterile conditions with minimal handling. Our final processing is
              accomplished under mild aqueous conditions, pH 3, 55 ÝC for 10 minutes. The
              purpose of this study is twofold: (1) establish the general utility of this
              chemistry by synthesizing a variety of RNA oligonucleotides to be evaluated by
              several collaborators, (2) confirm the RNA quality by using a broad spectrum of
              chemical and biochemical assays.              The market for oligonucleotides
              should grow significantly to a multi-million dollar level if this cost
              effective route to these materials can be developed.
