Abstract    :
                 This program addresses the feasibility of a  process to recover three
              platinum group metals including platinum, palladium and rhodium, and rhenium
              from spent catalysts. The catalysts to be treated will include spent automobile
              catalytic converters and petroleum refining catalysts. The technology is based
              on a hydrometallurgical technique using halogen salts. The process is
              inherently environmentally benign since the reaction takes place in a
              completely enclosed autoclave. Furthermore, the chemicals used in the process
              will be continuously regenerated and recycled resulting in very little solid or
              liquid disposal. In Phase I the following key factors essential to the success
              of the new process will be evaluated: (i) the optimum extraction conditions,
              (ii) solid liquid separation after dissolution, and (iii) separation of
              individual metals after leaching. The results will be related to Phase II
              (continuous pilot tests for handling of 20 kg a day process) and Phase III
              (commercialization for handling of 1 2 ton a day process operation).  The
              proposed technology is designed to be compatible with existing technologies by
              saving energy by 80% and also by an environmentally benign process. The number
              of units using this technology operated in the U.S. by the year 2010 is
              estimated to be 56 and the calculated energy savings by this technology would
              be over $100 million. The estimated waste savings in the same year is 300
              million pounds and the estimated job savings would be over $100 millions.
