Abstract    :
              ***  96660948  Greer     This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project
              will investigate the efficacy of a thermal source of atomic nitrogen and
              hydrogen for molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) applications. Both of these species
              are useful in the deposition of many electronic, optical, and tribological
              materials. Presently plasma sources produce about 1% N1 or H1, but also yield
              an equal number of energetic ions which can be undesirable during the growth of
              materials like GaN by MBE. Furthermore, the ability to monitor the atomic gas
              flux would allow closed-loop feedback control greatly improving the deposition
              process. The project will characterize the efficiency of our thermal source for
              producing both N1 and H1 and this source should yield up to 10 % N1 and over 60
              % H1 with atomic fluxes at the substrate surface in excess of 1 and 5 x 1015
              atoms/cm2/sec, respectively. We will incorporate this source into an MBE system
              to grow and then characterize high quality GaN films. Finally, we plan to
              conduct a study of potential techniques which might be used as an in-situ
              monitor for N1. Our thermal N1/H1 source has many advantages over conventional
              plasma sources including a higher atomic flux, lower contamination, and does
              not produce ions.   A high flux thermal N1/H1 source will increase the growth
              rates of high quality MBE GaN material by about an order of magnitude.  GaN
              will be used in a variety electro-optic applications including blue lasers and
              LEDs and will create many new opportunities itself.  Furthermore, it is also
              expected that this source will be quickly incorporated into many other physical
              vapor deposition processes for the growth of cBN, C3N4, and/or low temperature
              diamond materials, to name a few.  Each of these materials themselves may
              enable new or emerging technologies and generate opportunities for many US
              companies.  ***
