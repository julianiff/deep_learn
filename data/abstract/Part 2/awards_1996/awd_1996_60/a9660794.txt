Abstract    :
                 This  project addresses novel, high permeability ceramic membranes for oxygen
              separation from air. High permeation is the result of both, novel materials and
              an enhancement in surface exchange kinetics by more than an order of magnitude
              using a patented process. This approach has already led to an improvement of
              over 700% in power density (> 1.2 watts/cm2 at 800ÝC) of solid oxide fuel cells
              over the state-of-the-art. Highly efficient oxygen ion conducting membranes for
              voltage driven and mixed conducting membranes for pressure driven systems will
              be fabricated in the form of thin dense films over porous supports. Their
              permeation characteristics will be investigated. It is anticipated that the
              resulting membranes will exhibit at least ten times greater permeability than
              the best known oxide perovskites. A preliminary design of an oxygen separator
              using these ceramic membranes will be made.   The potential commercial
              applications of oxygen separation systems based on these ceramic membranes
              include: (1) Oxy-gas retrofit in glass industry, (2) Oxygen generators for
              medical industry, chemical industry, (3) Preservation by oxygen removal in food
              industry, (4) Oxidative coupling of methane, (5) Source of pure oxygen for
              semiconductor industry.
