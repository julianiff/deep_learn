Abstract    :
              ***  9660152  Kaiser     This project is focused on development of a new class
              of chemical sensors for detection of a variety of volatile organic carbon (VOC)
              pollutants, including chlorinated hydrocarbons. The ability to accurately and
              reliably achieve molecular discrimination between various VOC's will be based
              on a polymeric monolayer utilizing a new class of polymers called Starburstd9
              dendrimers. This project will systematically examine the relationship between
              the dendritic structure and chemical composition of these nanoscopic-sized
              spheroidal polymers and their ability to differentiate between chemical
              molecules with a variety of functional groups. A designed series of dendritic
              polymers will be synthesized and will be covalently attached to a gold surface
              to form a self-assembled monolayer, and the suitability of the dendrimer to act
              as a chemically sensitive interface will be determined by challenging
              dendrimer-modified surface acoustic wave (SAW) mass balances with vapor-phase
              probe molecules. This will facilitate development of new sensor technology by
              elucidation of molecular mechanisms and response optimization.                 
                          This technology could permit development of reliable,
              application-specific detectors in areas such as: health and safety monitoring,
              environmental remediation, industrial process control and auto emissions.  ***
