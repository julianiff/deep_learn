Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9660604  Mathia     This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will develop a practical methodology for applying to real world
              engineering applications new nonlinear adaptive critic principals which
              incorporate recurrent neural networks. Accurate Automation has recently
              developed a powerful new theory which guarantees stable adaptive critic control
              systems. This theory describes certain properties that the subsystems of the
              adaptive critic algorithm (action, model, critic) and their associated learning
              algorithms must have to ensure stable control. Recurrent neural networks are a
              powerful tool which can be applied to realize these properties. We will apply
              our theory to the development of a theoretical and experimental basis for
              understanding adaptive critics with recurrent neural network subsystems. The
              algorithm will learn 'on-line' to control a highly nonlinear system, with
              stability guaranteed and optimal performance guaranteed in the limit. Phase I
              will result in prototype of a commercializable software system.  In Phase II,
              we will develop special purpose hardware for sale.   The adaptive critic under
              development in this research will be targeted specifically for application in
              aircraft, making the aircraft industry the most obvious commercial arena for
              this technology.  Because the adaptive critic algorithm is very general, it
              will also have applications in any industry requiring good nonlinear controls.
              Examples of these industries are the chemical industry, the automobile
              industry, and the photocopier industry. ***
