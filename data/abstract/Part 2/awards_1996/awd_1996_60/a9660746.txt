Abstract    :
              9660746  McDonald       This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) I project
              will design and test key components of an advanced coring system.  The research
              will address real-time monitoring of the core length in the barrel and closure
              of the barrel opening to prevent core loss.  While partial or complete core
              loss is generally not a problem in competent formations, it is a serious
              problem in unconsolidated and highly fractured ones.  Partial core loss is
              experienced in approximately 20% of wells cored, representing considerable
              costs.  Phase I will combine acoustic measurement technology with a high speed,
              microprocessor-based data acquisition system and mud-pulse telemetry unit.  The
              acoustic sensors will be deployed along the inner core barrel.  The
              microprocessor will transmit the status of the coring operation to the surface
              by controlling the position of a valve located above the core barrel to
              modulate standpipe pressure using a pulsewidth modulation scheme.  The bottom
              of the core barrel will be fitted with a springloaded valve which fully closes
              to prevent core loss.  The valve is actuated by momentarily increasing the mud
              flow rate.       Commercial applications are expected in geologic
              investigation, fossil fuel exploration, and environmental remediation.  This
              technology will be compatible with conventional and wireline-retrievable coring
              systems for use in commercial coring services.
