Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9660975  Yu      This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will develop a polymer diode photodetector device for use as a
              large area, high sensitivity image sensor. Although linear diode arrays and
              small area, monochromatic and full-color COD matrices have been developed (and
              used in devices such as scanners and video cameras), there are special
              opportunities for using large area, flexible image sensors. One possible
              application might be a flexible or foldable, thin image sensor of book size
              that could directly and rapidly read images into memory (without scanning) from
              either paper, computer monitors, or TV screens. The stored image could then be
              copied over to another piece of paper or even sent by fax to a remote site.
              Polymer diode photodetector devices provide a novel and attractive approach to
              such large area, high sensitivity image sensing. The proposed Phase I research
              will continue UNIAX's ongoing development of photonic and electronic devices
              based on semiconducting organic polymers and will focus both on identifying
              materials appropriate for the spectral ranges of interest (such as full-color
              capability), and on optimizing device parameters. Device operating life and
              environmental stability are other parameters to be characterized during the
              Phase I effort.   Polymer diode photodetectors would address a strategic need
              for large area linear diode arrays and image sensors for military applications
              such as strategic threat warning and target identification and tracking in
              aerial reconnaissance vehicles.  These military applications would be balanced
              by a number of commercial applications in the office automation and consumer
              electronics industries, as well as in astrophysics/space technology and in
              medical technology. ***
