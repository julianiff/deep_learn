Abstract    :
              ***  96-60740  Vasudevan    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
              I Project will test a new method of detecting aromatic hydrocarbons, with
              particular application to monitoring subsurface concentrations of these
              compounds in both vapor (vadose zone) and liquid phases.  Bioremediation has
              emerged as the method of choice to treat these contaminants.  This is an
              opportunistic process, wherein the different aromatic compounds are degraded
              sequentially at varied rates.  Current methods can be used to monitor the total
              hydrocarbon concentrations in situ, but they cannot differentiate between
              individual aromatic compounds.  In addition, the sensitivity of current
              techniques (low parts per million range) is inadequate to meet current
              regulatory standards.  Hence, new methods are required that improve sensitivity
              and selectivity.  The Phase I sensor will provide parts per billion sensitivity
              for four important aromatic species, independently.  Called BTEX compounds,
              these are benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and the xylenes (all isomers).  The
              sensor will detect changes in the refractive index of a substitute cladding on
              a fiber-optic cable.  The substitute cladding used here will be a polymer that
              is sensitized to bind selectively individual BTEX compounds, using a chemical
              method that does not change other material properties, thus imparting
              selectivity to an otherwise inert polymer.    More than 1.5 million sites
              exist, in the U.S. alone, that are contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons, to
              which this technology could be applied.  Additional environmental sensing
              applications could be developed rapidly using this design methodology.  ***
