Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      96-60638  Tsveybak      This Small Business Innovation
              Research Phase I program will develop a new crystal growth process for AgGaS2
              single crystals. The excellent nonlinear and optical transmission properties of
              AgGaS2 make it a unique material for an optical parametric oscillator that can
              be pumped by a 1.06 (m laser to provide laser radiation continuously tunable
              from 2.5 to 10 (m. The very promising potential for AgGaS2 crystals for this
              application has not yet been realized because commercially available crystals
              are too costly, take too long to produce, and are limited in size. A new
              crystal growth process for AgGaS2 will be developed during this Phase I effort
              that will overcome these limitations.   An infrared laser source continuously
              tunable from 2.5 to 10 (m will play an important role in environmental
              monitoring for chemical species, spectroscopy, microelectronics manufacturing,
              and optical spectrometers. ***
