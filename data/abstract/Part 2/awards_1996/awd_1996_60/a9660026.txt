              Phase I project will explore a novel process for economical synthesis of
              inorganic nanoparticles via microemulsion synthesis, which can be scaled
              readily to industrial-scale production.  There are many methods for creation of
              nano-sized particles, but most synthetic techniques for nanoparticle production
              have rather limited potential for scale-up to manufacturing scale due to high
              capital costs, intrinsically low production rates, need for exotic/expensive
              precursor materials, limited applicability to many chemical compositions,
              and/or inadequate control over nanoparticle chemical and physical homogeneity. 
              Phase I will study the use of water-in-oil microemulsions as "nano-reactors," a
              technique which has been used at a bench-scale to prepare nanoparticles in a
              number of chemical compositions using inexpensive equipment and precursors. 
              This method of nanoparticle synthesis is thought to be free of the above
              limitations and to avoid a need in nanopowder manufacture to separate and
              recycle most of the microemulsion components for re-use.    Commercial
              application of this process is expected to enhance production of inorganic
              nanoparticles for use in catalysis, structural materials, and microelectronic,
              photonic, and optical devices.  ***
