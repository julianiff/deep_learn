Abstract    :
              ***  9660335  Kwan    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              describes a new approach to flow control in high speed communication networks
              which can significantly reduce the packet delays. In many networks, even the
              traffic is routed optimally, there are situations where the total traffic into
              the network is much larger than the network can handle. If no control
              strategies are present to limit the traffic into the network, queue sizes at
              bottleneck links will grow and packet delays will increase which may violate
              some maximum delay specifications for voice and video signals. The flow control
              problem is first treated as a fluid-flow dynamic system with time delay. Based
              on the model, we propose a flow controller that can generate some predictive
              information about the future queue length in the system. This predictive
              information is crucial to the success of the flow control scheme since it
              guarantees that the time delay of packets will not go unstable. Thus the
              maximum time delay performance criterion can be assured. In addition, the new
              flow control method can also maintain certain throughput of the system which is
              very important in applications such as video distribution. A new type of neural
              network called Fuzzy CMAC (Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer) is also
              proposed to predict the total information delay and the channel disturbance.
              The outputs of the Fuzzy CMAC will be passed to the flow controller to enhance
              the performance even further.  The new flow control method can guarantee the
              maximum packet delay criterion and can also maintain a desired minimum
              throughput of the system which is very important in applications such as video
              distribution.  Another advantage is that the controller is very easy to
              implement.  The proposed algorithm should find many applications in broadband
              ISDN and ATM networks.  ***
