Abstract    :
              ***  96-60960  Sibold    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will develop a low cost process for toughening alumina ceramics, which
              are widely used in wear, corrosion, and electrical insulation applications in
              virtually all industries and markets.  Presently, brittleness of these ceramics
              and their high cost sharply limit their use.  This research will examine a low
              cost, water based ceramic precursor that can be used to toughen conventional
              aluminas.  Porous commercial alumina preforms will be infiltrated with the
              precursor to develop a platelet toughened alumina. The only new processing step
              that this would require is infiltration prior to final firing in a commercial
              ceramic production line.    Commercial applications are expected in tougher low
              cost alumina ceramics.  ***
