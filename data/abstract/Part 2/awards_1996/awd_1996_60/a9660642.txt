Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9660642  Pirzada     This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will develop a novel process to produce single crystal silicon
              carbide. Silicon carbide possesses a unique combination of electrical and
              thermophysical properties that make its use in high temperature, high power and
              high-frequency electronics applications very attractive. The availability of a
              single crystal silicon carbide wafer of the required quality at a reasonable
              cost will fully realize the benefits of these devices in many areas of high
              temperature, high power microelectronics. During Phase I, the feasibility of
              this new approach to producing single crystal silicon carbide will be
              demonstrated. The technology will optimized during Phase II with the aim of
              commercializing the process in Phase III.   Successful development of a
              cost-effective method for producing quality single crystal silicon carbide will
              enable the application of high temperature, high power microelectronic devices
              in the automotive, aerospace, chemical refining, nuclear power, energy
              production, and other industries. ***
