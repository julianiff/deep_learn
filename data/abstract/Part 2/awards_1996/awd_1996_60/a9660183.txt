Abstract    :
                ***  9660183  Kortenkamp     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project is to develop a stereo vision system that can perform pursuit and
              obstacle avoidance functions for a mobile robot. Visual sensing has long been a
              significant obstacle to deploying truly autonomous mobile robots. Existing
              vision systems are either too slow or too expensive.  The focus of this effort
              is to concentrate system resources in cubic volumes of space called proximity
              spaces. Within the bounds of this space an array of stereo and motion
              measurements are made in order to determine which regions of the space are
              occupied by surface material, and what the spatial and temporal disparities are
              within those regions. This project will look at extending an approach to
              pursuit and obstacle avoidance for mobile robots. This will improve the
              flexibility and safety of current robotic systems and increase the range of
              tasks to which robots can be applied.   This product will have wide
              applications in the emerging service robotics industry, hazardous waste
              inspection and clean-up, service robotics (i.e., delivery, security,
              warehousing), research robots, and the entertainment industry.  ***
