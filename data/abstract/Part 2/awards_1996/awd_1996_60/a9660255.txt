Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9660255  Sabri     This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project involves research on development and application of optical
              data acquisition system, I/O devices, optical data analysis and recognition,
              derived from basic concepts in optical physics in innovative ways to problems
              in security, credit cards, identification cards, protection of computer chips,
              etc. Specifically, an optical security system embodying phase-encoding will be
              conceptualized as encryption means in conjunction with biometric measurements,
              with the general objective of production of an automatic tamper-proof security
              system, which cannot be defeated by application of the rapidly advancing
              computers, charged coupled device (CCD) technology, image processing hardware
              and software, printers, scanners, and copiers, which can provide real-time
              validation and security verification of individuals, and which can be extended
              to verification of objects, documents, etc. In Phase I, various concepts will
              be developed with emphasis on the use of retinal scanning. A trade study will
              be performed to select a feasible concept for future implementation. The
              concept will be rapidly prototyped for a proof-of-concept experiment, for
              feasibility evaluation of the proposed concept, and for providing a preliminary
              design and demonstration plan for Phase II, which will involve development,
              building, and testing of a brass-board model of the optical security system.  
              The commercial market is desperately in need of a simple, inexpensive scheme to
              stem the $2 billion fraud rampant in this sector. In addition, there are ample
              military uses in entry into secure or sensitive areas, and the verification of
              parts, such as computer chips purchased by the government. It is very likely
              that phase-encoded encryption schemes could solve both these problems. ***
