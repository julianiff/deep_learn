Abstract    :
              ***  9660223  Benassi         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              Project will produce an instrument that will be useful in the research
              environment and , with a more developed user interface, can be useful in many
              other research fields and commercial applications. The research objectives are
              to determine the optimum hardware architecture, the associated software
              algorithms, and the implements a real-time imaging instrument. The research
              addresses:  (a)  the problem of low signal to noise ratios in imaging systems,
              and (b) the need for real-time image enhancement associated with electron
              microscopy and related fields.  The latest generation of microprocessor
              technology, specifically Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), is now powerful
              enough to perform real-time image enhancement. An existing SEM/TEM facility
              will be used to address these objectives.       The proposed technology has
              commercial applications in any field using video imaging for analysis of
              presentation.  The project is expected to result in the creation of a research
              grade instrument for electron microscopy.  Future commercial candidate areas
              are radiology, flouroscopy, ultrasound, optical microscopy, scanning tunneling
              and atomic force microscopy.  ***
