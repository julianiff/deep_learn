Abstract    :
              ***  96-60765  Gluck     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will explore a new approach to ultra fine polishing of
              nickel-phosphorous coated hard memory disks.  Phase I will investigate an
              entirely new approach to nickel-phosphorus polishing that uses a fixed abrasive
              polish stone, and coolant.  Optimization will be accomplished by comparison
              with the existing foreign technology of soft polishing.  Increased memory
              densities (from 1 gigabit per square inch to 3 gigabits per square inch) and
              pseudo contact recording for read/write heads will be investigated.    Initial
              products for the electronics industry will be high performance foamed stones
              engineered specifically for flat surface polishing.  This innovation in
              polishing may induce changes in other important operations in electronics
              manufacture.  ***
