Abstract    :
              ***  9660138  Ivkovich    This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will investigate and experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of a
              novel approach to real-time process monitoring and MMI (man-machine interface)
              feedback for manual welding.  Direct and indirect (hidden) process information
              will be used to improve stability and repeatability of the manual welding
              process.  Phase I will address operator-dependent variations in process control
              and repeatability.  These variations will be minimized by identifying welding
              defects and implementing 'in-process' repair.  Phase I will provide
              experimental results which quantify performance feasibility for representative
              welding candidate operations.  This approach is expected to reduce welding
              re-work, improve quality, and reduce weld inspection and testing requirements. 
                Commercial applications are expected in manual welding applications within
              the automotive, aerospace, heavy manufacturing, ship-building, oil,
              petrochemical, process, power generation, and machinery industry sectors.  ***
