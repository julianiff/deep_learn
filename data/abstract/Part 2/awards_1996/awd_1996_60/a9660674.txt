Abstract    :
              ***  96-60674  Hoyt                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase
              I project aims to develop adhesives with thermal and mechanical properties
              suitable for applications in the aerospace industry. The ideal requirements for
              these materials are rather stringent. The materials must exhibit high strength
              and high fracture toughness, good chemical resistance and long-term thermal
              stability somewhere in the range 150 C-370 C. While there is a significant
              research effort in high-temperature adhesives, currently available materials
              fall well short of the ideal requirements. We propose to investigate liquid
              crystalline thermoses (LCT) systems to be applied as adhesives suitable for use
              in high-temperature, high-performance environments. LCTs, like their liquid
              crystalline polymer (LOP) analogues, are expected to offer significant
              enhancements in thermal and mechanical properties and chemical resistance over
              their non-liquid crystalline counterparts. In addition, the inherent low melt
              viscosity of liquid crystalline materials should bring about several processing
              advantages in adhesive applications. The materials investigated will be
              generally modeled on known examples of melt-processable or thermotropic LCTs.
              Reactive endgroups will be chosen based on standards in the industry; some
              proprietary endgroups will be tested. The major product of Phase I is the data
              required for system optimization and extended bond testing in Phase II. These
              data should also provide information on structure-property relationships in
              LCTs and for adhesives in general.                If this work is successful, a
              new type of adhesive for high-temperature applications should be realized.
              While the application of these materials is initially focused on the aerospace
              industry, there is potential for use in other areas such as lightweight
              structural materials for bridges and in high speed transportation systems.
