Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9660605  Sofge     This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will develop and test a new approach to active interior noise
              control in a three-dimensional enclosure. The new thrust in the proposed
              research is a digital adaptive system that makes use of both analyses and
              directly measured data from a three-dimensional enclosure to card out active
              noise control by using smart materials located on flexible boundaries of the
              enclosure. The system is intended to track the changes in the acoustic
              information due to movement, changes in open apertures, etc. and carry out
              on-line minimization to realize the desired acoustic performance. Unlike most
              methods that assume that the acoustic field inside the enclosure can be modeled
              by using standing waves, the proposed method is designed to accommodate diffuse
              sound fields in the enclosure. Furthermore, the noise is not assumed to be
              harmonic and nonperiodic sound fields are to be considered. The neural network
              based filter proposed herein can make use of analytical and experimental data
              to assign initial weights that are to be adapted to carry out (locally) on-line
              minimization of sound pressure in the enclosure.   Noise reduction in aircraft
              is a subject of serious commercial concern in the industry.   The techniques
              developed in this effort will be widely applicable to noise reduction in
              rotorcraft cabins of commercial helicopters, and may be adapted for use in
              commercial airline cockpits, as well as in factory settings and other vibration
              critical manufacturing environments. ***
