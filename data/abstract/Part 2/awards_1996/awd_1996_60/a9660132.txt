Abstract    :
              ***  9660132  Bayless    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              addresses the critical need for long-life neutron generators for use in
              nondestructive evaluation and in situ testing. A new type of solid-target,
              sealed neutron generator, the Distributed Neutron Generator (DNG), is the focus
              of this research.  It will be designed to meet requirements for high neutron
              output (up to 103 n/s at 14 MeV), low power consumption (<1 kW), small size,
              low cost, and long lifetime (>3,000 hours), and can be operated dc or pulsed. 
              No existing neutron generator offers this combination of desirable
              characteristics. The overall objective of the project (Phases I and II) is to
              demonstrate the feasibility of the DNG concept. The objectives of Phase I are
              to: (1) construct a proof-of-principle generator for operation at 125 kV; (2)
              to experimentally demonstrate that a uniform, high energy ion beam can be
              generated; and (3) to develop the conceptual design for a Phase II laboratory
              prototype DNG system. A large company, which is interested in future
              commercialization of DNG technology, will participate in Phase I.    If
              successful, the project will develop a new type of neutron generator with
              highly advanced capabilities.  Discussions with potential users indicate that
              the market for this generator will be large.  Its applications include:  (1)
              ore analysis; (2) airport luggage inspection; (3) detection of landmines,
              explosives, chemical warfare agents and small quantities of nuclear material;
              (4) industrial process control; and (5) instruments for treaty verification.
