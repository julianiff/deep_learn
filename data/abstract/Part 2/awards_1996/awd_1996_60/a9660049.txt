Abstract    :
              ***  9660049  Goswami     Carbon dioxide is a major end product of fossil fuel
              combustion and many other energy-related terrestrial activities.  It is also an
              important pollutant.  How CO2 is assimilated and transformed by terrestrial and
              marine ecosystems is unclear, but it is known that the world's oceans are the
              single largest sink for atmospheric CO2.  It is very important to monitor
              CO2-related processes and parameters, because the results of such monitoring
              are critical to chemical oceanography, to atmospheric science, to marine
              biology, and to the direction of future energy policies.  Physical Optics
              Corporation (POC) proposes a completely integrated sensor system for long term
              (at least a year) autonomous buoy-based monitoring of CO2 transport and
              exchange at the air-sea interface.  This fixed/flowing fiber optic chemical
              sensor (F30CS) system employs a miniaturized buffer flow coupled to a dual
              fiber optic optrode.  CO2 is sensed using a pH sensitive indicator such as mete
              cresol purple.  Dissolution of CO2 leads to reversible modulation of the buffer
              pH.  The pH indicator is permanently entrapped in porous polymer spheres.  A
              replenishable buffer solution eliminates the irreversible changes that have
              previously prevented the realization of long lived CO2 optrodes.   This sensor
              system is an instrument of particular importance to science and to the national
              critical technology area of pollution minimization and remediation.  It will
              significantly advance chemical oceanography, marine biology, atmospheric
              science, and ecosystem science.  In addition to marine-based monitoring, the
              instrument could be used in such terrestrial aquatic ecosystems as lakes,
              rivers, and reservoirs, and in water quality and general environmental
              applications.  Other applications include monitoring at severe/waste water
              discharge points, sewage treatment plants, and fish hatcheries.  ***
