Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will explore a
              new concept in passive vibration absorbing material. If successful, the
              resulting new material will have vastly superior performance over a broader
              range of frequencies for sound absorption, vibration isolation, and impact
              isolation than currently available materials. Previous work has yielded a new
              sound and vibration absorbing material with several valuable properties
              including significant attenuation at frequencies as low as 30 Hertz. That work
              has lead to an understanding of how to build better materials for noise,
              vibration, and shock attenuation. The new material to be developed in this
              research will be passive, light, highly reliable, and can be produced at low
              cost. Another benefit of the material is that the mechanism by which
              attenuation occurs is six degree of freedom.       Applications include
              isolation of delicate equipment from vibrations of the structure to which they
              are mounted, vibration isolation for high precision machine tools, lithography
              machines, scanning probe microscopes, and similar equipment.  It will also be
              usable as a new generation of vibration dampers on equipment such as automotive
              vehicles and aircraft.
