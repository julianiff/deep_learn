Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9660637  Moopenn      This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will develop a novel, compact, low-cost, and single chip
              adaptive neuroprocessor. This bit-serial based digital CMOS VLSI electronic
              neural network device will combine on-chip integration of a fully
              reconfigurable feedforward/time-lagged recurrent neuroprocessor with a
              backpropagation weight training module. Specifically, the technical objective
              of this research is to develop a neuroprocessor chip suitable for direct
              insertion into Ford's advanced concept vehicles. In operation, this stand-alone
              electronic neural network will act as a co-processor to the engine computer's
              (EEC) central processing unit (CPU). The neuroprocessor will be software
              programmable, enabling it to execute multiple different neural network
              applications on-the-fly; be capable of event rate computational throughput (<
              100 microseconds) per application; be of a single-chip design (neuroprocessor
              with on-chip weight training); and cost effective (< $20/chip). The importance
              of on-chip adaptation is to address the problems of fixed weight neural
              networks--namely that an applications synaptic weights (as optimized at the
              factory for a generic model) be allowed to tweak/self-calibrate themselves for
              optimal diagnostic and control performance on the vehicle in order to handle
              most accurately all conditions under which the particular system is deployed.  
              This research is in direct collaboration with Ford Motor Company.  The end
              product of this research and development is particularly relevant to all
              diagnostics and control applications in the automotive industry, in aerospace,
              as well as process control in the electronics commercial industry. ***
