Abstract    :
                ***  9660149  Thesling    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project proposes to study the feasibility of producing, in hardware, a class of
              forward error-correcting codes which are vastly superior to any currently
              available. These Turbo Product Codes (TPCs) are ideally suited to
              communications systems where large coding gain is required, but only a limited
              overhead is acceptable.  The best TPC evaluated to date offers a code rate of
              4/5 and a coding gain of 6.8 dB at a Bit Error Rate of 10-6, which is less than
              1.7 dB from the Shannon limit. To achieve this exceptional performance three
              innovative decoding algorithms that exhibit an extreme reduction in complexity
              over existing techniques were applied. The result is a simple, near-optimal
              decoder that enables the construction of a high-speed "turbo-like" codec on a
              chip.   The resulting codec chip is applicable to a large number of digital
              communications  systems.  This includes RF links for Wireless Local Area
              Networks in the license-free   industrial, scientific, and medical bands and
              infrared laser wireless systems for various  applications.  The codes also have
              applications in the next-generation satellite communications  systems.  ***
