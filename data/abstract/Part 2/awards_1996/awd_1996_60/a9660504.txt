Abstract    :
              ***  9660504  Waupotitsch     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will develop proof-of-concept geometric mathematical software tools to
              allow for the incremental reconstruction and control of surfaces and volumes
              generated from arbitrary point set data.  The tools will incorporate novel
              methods for geometric modeling based on a combination of concepts from
              combinatorial topology and computational geometry.  Current methods of surface
              reconstruction have found limited use due to a number of factors, including
              slow data processing, the introduction of approximation errors, and the
              requirement that data sets be well behaved.  If successful, this project will
              result in the development of an elegant and compact solution to automatic
              surface and volume reconstruction and model simplification which is free of
              these limitations.      The ability to accurately and automatically reconstruct
              or model the surface and volume of objects defined by an unstructured set of
              points has the potential to fundamentally impact a number of major economic
              sectors including the CAD/CAM, animation, and biological and medical modeling
              industries  .***
