Abstract    :
                 This proposal addresses a new means to separate chiral molecules useful in
              the synthesis of biologically active molecules, such as drugs, pesticides, etc.
              This process should afford a marked decrease in the economics of producing such
              synthons. because it allows for simultaneous product resolution, concentration,
              and purification. There is an increasing trend toward separate regulation of
              enantiomeric pairs of the chiral molecules found in many modern
              pharmaceuticals. Because typically only one of the two (or more) enantiomers
              possesses the desired biological activity, there is an increasing desire to
              perfect chemical processes which will yield chirally pure products. The
              proposed liquid membrane bioreactor, based on a hybrid reaction - separation
              scheme, is designed to meet such a need.   More economical routes to purer,
              biologically active drugs and pesticides are offered by the enhanced liquid
              membrane bioreactor proposed.  Highly value-added products of this sort
              represent an increasingly large segment of a multibillion dollar market, and
              current trends in legislation and pharmaceutical development favor the
              commercialization of such process technologies.
