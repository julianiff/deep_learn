Abstract    :
              ***  96-60196  Thurmes     This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research
              project will make Ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) gels, using low
              concentrations of cross-linked monomers, which have the structural integrity of
              the side-chain polymers, yet the fast switching time of FLC monomers. The
              project will use thermoplastic additives to achieve the three dimensional
              lattice formation by spontaneous self-assembly. For large area direct view flat
              panel displays, the small gap required in FLC devices makes the use of glass
              substrates problematical. A more attractive approach would be to use
              commercially available IndiumTinOxide (ITO)-coated flexible plastic substrates
              and process the FLC device in a web similar to a printing press. Unfortunately,
              the flow characteristics of FLC monomers make the final plastic sandwich
              unstable. FLC side-chain polymer s, on the other hand, do work in the web
              process, but switch too slowly for display purposes.      The applications for
              this technology include flat panel displays, micro displays, and FLC shutters.
