Abstract    :
                ***  ABSTRACT      9660427  How     This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will investigate an innovative design of planar microwave and
              millimeter wave (MMW) circulators compatible with integrated circuits.
              Traditionally, ferrite circulators are made using bulk materials in which holes
              need to be drilled to a very small tolerance in the dielectric substrates, and,
              hence, the fabrication cost are high. In addition, the need for permanent
              magnets further impedes the development of circulator designs toward monolithic
              microwave/MMW circuits. During Phase I, potential circuit geometries for
              designing practical planar microwave/MMW circulators will be identified,
              proof-of-concept experiments will be completed, and a commercialization
              strategy will be outlined. During Phase II, a prototype thin-film circulator
              will be designed, fabricated and tested and self-biasing circulators employing
              hexagonal ferrite films will be developed. Major cost and applicability issues
              associated with commercialization of the proposed circulator designs will be
              explored.   This research and development will seek to provide low cost
              production of circulators that will facilitate their commercialization so that
              high performance circulators can find direct commercial applicability in the
              radar and communication industries. The results of this research effort will
              enhance U.S. competitiveness by advancing the state-of-the-art in the knowledge
              and understanding of microwave/MMW integrated-circuit circulators. ***
