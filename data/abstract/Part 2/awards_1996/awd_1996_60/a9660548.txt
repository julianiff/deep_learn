Abstract    :
              ***  96-60548  Cutler     This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will investigate the collection and analysis of sound generated by
              in-situ process equipment as a diagnostic of process state.  The new technique
              will combine acoustic beam forming for isolation and monitoring of specific
              sound generation sites and analysis of sound signatures for determination of
              equipment operational parameters.  Sound and vibration generated by equipment
              is a reliable indication of equipment state.  This technique will allow focused
              monitoring of system elements not typically accessed (such as piping) and high
              level, supervisory monitoring of overall process state without extensive
              hardware installation. Inclusion of valves and piping will permit automated
              detection and localization of system malfunctions such as leaks, turbulence,
              and steam hammering that are not treatable with traditional process monitoring
              equipment.  Phase I will develop a low cost, easily customizable instrument
              that will be equally applicable to installation in new manufacturing plants and
              to non-intrusive retrofit of existing plants.    Commercial applications are
              expected in large predictive maintenance market.  Low cost installation, simple
              operation, and small personnel requirements will be useful in the process
              monitoring and predictive maintenance fields.  ***
