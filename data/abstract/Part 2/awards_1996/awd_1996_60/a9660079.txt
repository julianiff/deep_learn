Abstract    :
              ***  96-60079  Owen     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              is feasibility study of a proposed Coastal Ocean Processes Sensor (COPS) array
              of fiber-optics linked sensors.  COPS uses video holography and
              wavelet-transform optical correlation to record and analyze ocean particulates.
               COPS integrates a number of small, rugged sensors and, once deployed, sensors
              can be added.  Each sensor can be relocated within the reach of its fiber link.
               Detailed characterization of particulates is central to understanding the
              subsea environment.  COPS measures particulates at a variety of scattered sites
              with a collection of holographic sensors linked to a central data processing
              unit on shore.  The objective of the research is to build and test a breadboard
              COPS sensor and fiber links.  Each COPS sensor records a 3-D field of
              particulates for wavelet analysis and classification.  By the end of Phase I,
              there will be a detailed COPS design. Workers will record video holograms of
              particulates through fibers to show hardware feasibility.  They will use
              wavelet processing to analyze mass and fluid transport and show software
              feasibility.  The next phase of the research will include sea trials.   The
              commercial applications of this Coastal Ocean Processes Sensor, include studies
              of marine aggregate particle dynamics; these dynamics involve biological
              processes and mechanisms, as well as the chemical/physical processes that
              affect aggregation.  Other applications include environmental surveying,
              aquaculture, ocean waste disposal monitoring, engineering turbidity, mine
              tailing monitoring, and underwater lidar.  Government applications include a
              variety of naval coastal sensors.  ***
