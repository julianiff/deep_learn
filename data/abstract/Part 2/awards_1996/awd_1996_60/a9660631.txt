Abstract    :
               ***   9660631   Carter     This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research
              project addresses the bulk synthesis of aluminum nitride (A1N) precursors
              utilizing acid-base chemistry in an ambient temperature chloroaluminate molten
              salt. The molten salt is composed of a mixture of aluminum chloride (AlCl3) and
              trimethylphenylammonium chloride (TMPACl) which forms a liquid
              tetrachloroaluminate below room temperature. AlN precursors will be formed as
              Lewis acid-base adducts containing 1:1 ratios of Al to N. Precursor
              stoichiometry will be fixed by the inherent nature of the Lewis acid-base
              interaction between nitrogenous bases such as ammonia and hydrazine and
              heptachlorodialuminate, the predominant Lewis acid in acidic melts. The
              proposed approach differs from those relying on formation of a polymeric
              precursor in that it will result in easily handlable solid preceramic materials
              of the exact stoichiometry required in the final product. The preceramic
              material is prepared such that no carbide or oxide contamination is introduced
              into the final product.    The proposed technology for production of bulk
              aluminum nitride in highly pure form will  find use immediately in electronics
              applications, where A1N is used as a heat dissipation medium  and substrate
              material.  It is also used in non-electronic applications, e.g., evaporation
              boats.   Annual production of A1N was approximately 120-130 tons in 1993.  A
              substantial driving force  exists, therefore, to find alternative,
              cost-effective methods to produce this material.   ***
