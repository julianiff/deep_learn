Abstract    :
              ***  96-60802  Lombardi    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
              I project will develop novel, high efficiency superfinishing polishing platens
              using extrusion solid free forming technology.  These platens will be composed
              of engineering themoplastics reinforced with chopped carbon fibers and/or
              diamond abrasives.  The platens will also have varying amounts of
              microchanneling throughout their structures to collect polishing swarf more
              efficiently compared to conventional polishing platens.    These superfinishing
              platens are thought to represent a major innovation in ultraprecision polishing
              technology and will find extensive commercial application in the U.S.
              electronics industry.  ***
