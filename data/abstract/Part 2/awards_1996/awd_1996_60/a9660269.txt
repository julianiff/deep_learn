Abstract    :
              ***  9660269  Garst     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will determine the feasibility of developing a natural and easy system for
              input and editing of mathematical notation on a computer. Computer interfaces
              have made great progress in most areas, but communication of mathematical
              notation to computers remains unnatural and slow. It is believed that
              handwritten input of mathematical notation will be efficient and natural to
              users. The proposed Phase I work includes: collection of handwritten
              mathematical data; research into algorithms for recognizing and editing
              mathematical notation; and investigation into how to effectively integrate
              these capabilities into a natural user interface.   The market for natural and
              efficient input of mathematical notation is potentially very large.  This
              technology would allow the development of a range of innovative products
              catering to students and professionals in many technical, business and
              educational fields.  Examples include:  handhold calculators which accept
              symbolic problems as easily as numeric ones, word processors easier to use than
              pencil and paper for input of mathematical notation; easy communication of
              mathematical notation over computer networks;  and others.  ***
