Abstract    :
              ***  96-60054  Twardoch   Iridium oxide is becoming the material of choice for
              electrodes in functional electrical stimulation (FES) because of its corrosion
              resistance, low impedance, and high charge injection capacity.  Use of Ir metal
              electrodes which can be anodized, however, is not always possible. Alternative
              deposition methods of Ir oxide films such as sputtering or thermal
              decomposition of Ir precursors are unacceptable for many of the complex and
              thermally sensitive devices such as cochlear implants and neural cuffs.  The
              objective of this research is to develop a process for electrodepositing Ir
              oxide at temperatures below 100 C to produce conformal coatings.  Manufactured
              electrodes for a variety of FES applications can be "retrofitted" with the
              coatings, or the coating procedure can be integrated into the production
              process.  The Phase I project will investigate both electroplating of thin,
              nonporous Ir followed by anodic "activation" and direct deposition of Ir oxide.
               Advanced tools for optimizing electrodeposition protocols will be employed,
              including computer-controlled potentiostatic waveforms and the electrochemical
              quartz crystal nanobalance.  The physical properties of the coatings will be
              evaluated as well as their suitability as stimulating electrodes.  The methods
              producing the best quality films will be used in the next phase to coat
              electrodes currently used in FES research and commercial products.      The
              proferred significant improvement in the technology of electroactive prosthetic
              devices will be used in commercial medical electrodes for treatment of neural
              functional impairment such as hearing loss, incontinence, sexual dysfunction,
              limb paralysis, and spasticity and in equipment for coating electrodes.  ***
