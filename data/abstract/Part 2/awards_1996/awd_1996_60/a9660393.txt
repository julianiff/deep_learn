Abstract    :
              ***  96-60393  Gordon    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              Project will explore an improved commercial acoustic sensing system, called
              FishMASS, for long-term fish monitoring in the open ocean, estuaries, rivers,
              lakes, and streams.  Designed on top of Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler
              (ADCP) technology, FishMASS will collect a wider range of information about
              fish than other existing acoustic systems.  It will incorporate much of the
              capability of existing dual beam and split beam sorters, i.e., individual
              target strength measurement, without compromising ADCP normal capabilities.  In
              addition, FishMASS will add the ability to measure target velocity and target
              backscatter spectrum (over one octave in frequency), and it will use broadband
              signal processing to improve discrimination of single and multiple targets.  It
              will be designed for long-term monitoring, i.e., battery operation, internal
              data storage, and substantial internal data reduction, but it could easily be
              adapted for use on ships.  In addition to final, reduced data, FshMASS well
              provide raw and intermediate data products to facilitate algorithm development
              by users.    Commercial applications are expected in fisheries research
              institutions for research and to assess fish abundance.  FishMASS is expected
              to supplement and perhaps replace current methods for surveying fish from
              ships.  ***
