Abstract    :
              ***  96-60085  Seeker     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will study utilization of waste fuels for effective control of nitrogen
              oxides pollutants.  For many years, municipal solid waste (MSW) has been
              typically landfilled or combusted with emission of toxic compounds.  The
              problem of MSW utilization is twofold: a huge waste stream and the loss of the
              fuel energy content.  Another environmental problem faced by the power
              generation industry involves controlling flue gas emissions from coal fired
              boilers. Specifically, the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments mandate a 2,000,000
              ton per year decrease in nitrogen oxide emissions.  An innovative technology
              for utilizing MSW as a means of control would provide solutions to the
              environmental problems of waste disposal and air pollution.  Furthermore, the
              net cost of waste fuel is low, and thus such a technology would have great
              economic benefits.  Phase I will investigate firing carbonized refuse derived
              fuels, specially prepared from MSW, by utilizing innovative advanced reburning
              (AR) technologies.  Based on kinetic modeling and experimental studies with
              natural gas, novel concepts are available to improve the conventional reburning
              process to over 90% nitrogen oxide emissions control.     The integration of AR
              technologies with waste fuel will offer electric utilities a low cost option
              for effective control of these emissions.  Other commercial utilization is
              expected in the MSW disposal industry where salable by-product fuels will
              alleviate some of the economic burden imposed by this massive waste stream as
              well as reduce landfill requirements.  ***
