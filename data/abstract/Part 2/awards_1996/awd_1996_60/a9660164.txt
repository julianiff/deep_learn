Abstract    :
              ***  96-60164  Connolly      This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will develop computational methods for dynamically recomputing the
              solvent-accessible molecular surface as the molecule changes its conformation.
              The solvent-accessible molecular surface has been defined by Fred Richards of
              Yale University to be a smooth envelope surrounding a protein molecule. It has
              been found to be useful in studying protein-protein and drug-protein binding.
              Current methods for computing this surface recompute the entire surface even if
              just some of the atoms move. Recomputing the surface for just the region that
              has changed would result in a great savings in computation time and would allow
              a user of an interactive molecular display system to alter the protein
              conformation and watch the surface be recomputed in near real time.
              Applications include (a) protein homology model building, (b) site-specific
              mutagenesis in protein engineering, and (c) crystallographic structural
              uncertainty, where there are several possible orientations of a surface amino
              acid side chain.  ***
