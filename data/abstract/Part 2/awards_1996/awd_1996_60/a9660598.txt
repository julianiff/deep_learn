              ***  ABSTRACT      9660598  Hwang     This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will demonstrate the ability of Combustion Chemical Vapor
              Deposition (CCVD) technology to inexpensively deposit high quality reproducible
              YSZ, doped-LaGaO3 and other thin films for use in fuel cells, oxygen sensors,
              and other applications. Candidate solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) materials, such
              as YSZ, doped-LaGaO3, doped-LaCrO3, LSM and Ni-YSZ, have been deposited by thin
              and thick film techniques. However, many traditional thin film technologies are
              subject to certain limitations, such as the requirement for high vacuum
              chambers and line-of-sight limitation, which restrict their commercial
              viability for SOFCs. The ability to address these limitation and deposit low
              cost, high quality, fuel cell thin films at moderate substrate temperatures
              without post deposition treatment is essential for the wide spread
              commercialization of fuel cells. With the CCVD technology, high quality SOFC
              materials can be deposited at a 90% cost reduction and at twice the deposition
              rate of traditional CVD. MicroCoating Technologies (MCT) has shown that CCVD
              processing does achieve epitaxial, phase pure, dense, smooth coatings of YSZ
              and DLC materials, and porous, conductive, columnar Ni-YSZ and LSM.
              Additionally, BaCeO3, Pt and multilayered YSZ have been deposited by MCT.
              During this Phase I research, thin films of SOFC materials will be grown and
              the processing apparatus will be scaled up. In Phase II a small scale,
              commercial prototype for stacked SOFCs up to 20 cm across, with power density
              near 1 watt/cm2, will result from this effort.   Low cost, high quality YSZ,
              DLC, Ni-YSZ and LSM films for SOFCs stacked cells producing power densities of
              1 watt/cm2 are desired. The commercialization of stacked SOFCs in vehicles and
              portable power generation would be achieved by utilizing thin films to increase
              power density 10 times per units volume and mass. These high power densities
              position SOFCs to capitalize on a potential mult i-billion dollar industry, and
              at the same time offer significant environmental advantages. ***
