Abstract    :
                ***  9660309  Bonney     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will determine the feasibility of significantly improving the process
              of validation and verification (V&V) for large-scale, software systems, which
              has traditionally required excessive amounts of paper documentation for
              specifications, architectural descriptions, etc. Lead times associated with the
              distribution of physical documentation results in the review of outdated
              documents and a longer V&V cycle. There has been a slow trend towards using
              World Wide Web technology for cataloging system documentation, but Web pages
              and links are manually generated, which leads to omissions. More importantly, a
              comprehensive view of the project cannot be gleaned from the Web pages as key
              elements of the system are not maintained in a Web-usable format.  The
              objective of the proposed research is the development of a prototype Web-based
              V&V tool that takes formal system requirements, specifications, and a
              project-specific intranet, generates a comprehensive Web of project-specific
              information, and periodically updates the Web to reflect changes. The research
              focuses on automatic Web generation and the incorporation of systemdesign
              parameters in the generation process.    The commercial product of the
              research, a software-based V&V toot would be marketed to corporate and
              independent V&V groups thorough existing distribution channels.  ***
