Abstract    :
              ***  96-60727  Ham     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will synthesize and test new polymer materials for application in luminescent
              solar concentrators (LSC's). LSC's use a large area sheet to absorb solar
              radiation and light-pipe fluorescence efficiently to solar photovoltaic cells
              on the much smaller edge area. Thus, expensive solar cells can produce several
              times more electric power by using inexpensive plastic or glass sheets. LSC's
              work well in diffuse sunlight, do not need to track the sun, dissipate excess
              energy, and shift light toward the red where solar cells are more efficient.
              LSC's have been demonstrated to provide efficient energy converters but cannot
              be implemented because no suitable fluorescent materials (e.g. dyes in
              plastics) have been identified that do not bleach for long enough times to be
              cost effective. This firm has identified specific materials that should have
              the performance required for LSC.s to achieve competitive, levelized costs and
              proposes to prepare and test these novel materials .     This project will
              prepare polymer materials and measure their absorption and fluorescence spectra
              and their fluorescence quantum efficiencies. This firm will obtain preliminary
              longevity data for these materials using an accelerated weathering tester.
              These results will be used in a preliminary economic analysis to determine the
              feasibility of our approach.  ***  ??
