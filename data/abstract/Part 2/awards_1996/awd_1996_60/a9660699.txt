Abstract    :
              ***  9660699  Morford  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              to be carried out by Automated Functions, Inc. seeks to use innovative computer
              technology, Versatile Economic Speech Technology (VEST), to serve as a low-cost
              platform for products with speech and large-character displays to be used by
              blind and visually impaired people in education, employment, and daily living. 
              The core of the innovative technology is a Central Processing Unit (CPU) called
              a Program Interface Chip (PIC).  A PIC differs from general purpose computer
              processors in that it is low cost and has a smaller number of functions.  The
              Phase I feasibility activity will consist of the development and testing a
              scientific calculator for blind and visually impaired students.  VEST products
              have the potential of assisting thousands of visually impaired students and
              business professionals through the world enabling them to have low cost access
              to technology that increases their independence, productivity, and qualifty of
              life.  Potential products include a large print and talking scientific
              calculator, large print and talking restaurant menus, large print and talking
              pocket organizer, and many more.  These products will be converted to speak
              different foreign languages.  ***
