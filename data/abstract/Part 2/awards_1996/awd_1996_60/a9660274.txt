Abstract    :
              ***  96-60274  Lyon    This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will explore the fire   extinguishing properties of particles smaller
              than 100 microns.  Larger particles that are   commonly used in dry powder
              extinguishers absorb relatively little heat as they pass   through a flame, and
              they extinguish fires chiefly by absorbing heat from the   surroundings.  Small
              particles, however, can come to flame temperature and thus   remove heat
              directly from the flame by vaporizing and/or by acting as radiators.  They  
              can inhibit flame propagation by providing surface area for free radical
              recombination.    Small particles of calcium bromide may be particularly
              effective since they will oxidize to   calcium oxide and bromine.  Calcium
              oxide will cool the flame by acting as a radiator,   and the bromine will
              inhibit free radical reactions via the same mechanism which makes   halons
              effective fire extinguishing agents.  Phase I will address the problem of
              imparting   sufficient momentum to carry small particles to the flame and
              demonstrate a solution to   this problem.    With the banning of halons, polar
              operations and many other activities face severe fire   protection problems. 
              Commercial applications are anticipated in these and many other   fire
              suppression situations.  ***
