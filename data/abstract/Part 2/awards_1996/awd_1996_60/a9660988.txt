Abstract    :
                ***  9660988  Mehrotra      This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project is to develop a semi-automated tool, based on the Multi-ViewPoint
              Clustering methodology to perhaps discover significant underlying structures of
              such complex systems from multiple points of view. By presenting different
              perspectives of the system one can gain significant insight into different
              interrelationships across the exposed structures.  The ability to develop and
              maintain large, reliable, complex knowledge-based systems in a cost-effective
              manner is still a challenging problem. A viable tool to structure
              knowledge-based systems before they become operational, will enhance their
              reliability and maintainability.  Phase I of the effort will look at the 
              feasibility of automating the analysis process in the MVP-CA software and
              design an interactive interface for useful information exchange between the
              user and the system. Such information will prove an invaluable aid for many
              software life cycle activities such as verification, validation, testing and
              maintenance of a knowledge-based system.   MVP-CA tool will be a significant
              advantage to software developers and maintainers.  It is expected that this
              tool will be integrated as a value-added product into software development
              environments to support the following activities: verification, validation,
              testing, maintenance reengineering and migration of knowledge-based systems
              software to object-oriented platforms.  ***
