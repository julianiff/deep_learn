Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a
              correlator chip intended for cross-correlation and auto-correlation
              spectroscopy at millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths.  The correlator chip
              to be developed will have 500 MHz bandwidth, 256 channels, and a 4-level
              quantization scheme.  A laboratory prototype of a 32-channel correlator will be
              developed, fabricated, and tested in Phase I to demonstrate experimentally the
              feasibility and to provide the critical design information for the development
              of the much larger correlator chip planned for Phase II. To reach the desired
              level of performance, the proposed correlator chip will employ an innovative
              on-chip parallel processing architecture to achieve a bandwidth equal to the
              clock frequency.  The high frequency operation will be achieved with a
              combination of: bit-systolic arrays, a novel family of hyperfrequency CMOS
              digital circuits, input/output circuits capable of operating at data rates
              equal to the clock frequency over controlled impedance transmission lines, and
              the most advanced CMOS fabrication process available through the MOSIS service
              ( Hewlett-Packard 0.5 m).       The commercial market of correlator chips is
              estimated by us at $4 million in 1997, and it will grow 20% annually as many
              radio astronomy centers will be building focal-plane arrays.  The firm's
              business plan is to focus on the research, development, marketing, selling,
              technical support, and maintenance of a family of state-of-the-art correlator
              chips and spectrometers with application in radio astronomy and atmospheric
              research.  A competitive advantage is in the application of the innovative
              high-speed, non-saturating logic circuits to the implementation of correlator
              chips with superior performance-to-cost ratio.
