Abstract    :
              ***  96-60332  Haynes    This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will investigate the capture of three-dimensional data from scratches
              or striations made on a bullet when the gun is fired, by which a unique
              signature which can be matched with other bullets fired from the same gun. 
              Current practice of law enforcement agencies uses two-dimensional digitized
              data, where the associated matching algorithms have a 10% false match rate. 
              This is enough to render the concept of a National Database for Ballistics Data
              unfeasible.  Every query would yield tens of thousands of matches.  Phase I
              will evaluate the comparison of three-dimensional striation images.   
              Commercial application is expected in supplying units with the advanced
              three-dimensional capability to law enforcement agencies around the world.  ***
