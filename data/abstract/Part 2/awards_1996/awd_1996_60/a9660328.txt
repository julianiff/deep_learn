Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9660328  Dhar     This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project deals with issues on the improvement of a proton exchange
              membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack to obtain better reactant distribution and
              uniform performance among individual cells of the stack. The traditional
              serpentine flow patterns have drawbacks such as lengthy channels and non
              uniform reactant distribution among the cells in the stack. The reactant flow
              path is of utmost importance in determining continued trouble-free fuel cell
              operation. The research objectives include designing flow patterns and
              manifolding for air and hydrogen, demonstration of performance in single cells
              and multi-cell stack, and establishing variables such as depth and width of a
              channel for optimum performance. Single fuel cells of active area 50 cm2 will
              be assembled using graphite bipolar plates with the designed flow-fields. The
              membrane-electrode assemblies will be self-humidified types developed by BCS
              Technology. The fuel cells will be operated with cathodic reactants air and
              oxygen, and anodic reactant hydrogen. One four-cell stack will be evaluated to
              verify its performance and the flow related hypothesis at the stack-level. The
              anticipated results from this project are better reactant distribution among
              individual cells, uniform performance of all cells in a stack, and improved
              management of the product water.   Improved stack operation and cost reduction
              are needed for commercial viability of the PEM fuel cell.  As the conventional
              energy sources get depleted, the PEM fuel cell, with its quiet, clean, and
              renewable energy, will make a strong impact as an alternate stand-by power
              source for numerous applications.  The PEM fuel cell may also be used as a
              propulsion unit in next generation vehicles. ***
