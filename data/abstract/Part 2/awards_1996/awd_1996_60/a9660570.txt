Abstract    :
              ***  9660570  Pei      Recently, stimulated emission from polymer light-emitting
              materials and devices has also been of considerable interest. Based on new
              results demonstrating both polymer light emitting diodes ( LEDs) in microcavity
              geometries and photo-pumped stimulated emission using luminescent conjugated
              polymers, attention has now focused on efforts to realize electrically pumped
              polymer laser diodes. These efforts are hindered, however, by the fact that the
              luminescent conjugated polymers which have been the subject of the most intense
              investigation lack either sufficiently high photoluminescent efficient or
              carrier mobility (or both). In other candidate polymers, self-absorption,
              photo-induced absorption, or electro-induced absorption at wavelengths in the
              emission region prevents any stimulated emission. In this Phase I proposal, the
              synthesis of a series of luminescent conjugated polymers as candidates for
              evaluation against well-defined criteria is outlined. The polymers will be
              processed into high quality thin films for use in the fabrication of polymer
              light-emitting devices or to investigate photopumped stimulated emission.      
                     Optoelectric devices based on "plastic" semiconductors promise
              efficient, low cost devices which mimic the function of inorganic
              semiconductors but enjoy the benefits of being made of plastic: easy processing
              , mechanically flexible and durable. The market for the compact coherent light
              sources is large and growing.  ***
