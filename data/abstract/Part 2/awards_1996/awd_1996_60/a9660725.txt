Abstract    :
                 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will address the
              feasibility of designing and fabricating a one piece carbon fiber composite
              membrane reflecting surface for an 8-meter aperture millimeter wave radio
              telescope.  Methods of fabricating a suitably precise tooling mandrel will be
              explored, along with the selection of materials and fabrication processes for a
              single piece membrane.  In addition, metallization alternatives will be
              identified along with the means for protecting the reflective surface from the
              environment.  Alternative protective coating samples will be submitted to
              National Radio Astronomy Observatory for testing and evaluation.  The Phase I
              Final Report will include a membrane concept design, a tooling mandrel concept
              preliminary manufacturing plan and cost estimate for the candidate reflecting
              surface.   The potential commercial applications of this research include radio
              telescope applications in the millimeter wave portion of the spectrum where low
              mass, high precision, thermal stability environmental endurance and low cost
              are important.  Ka-Band communications satellite systems ground segments are
              also candidates for this technology.  The current plans of the FCC to find
              commercial uses for the millimeter wave portions of the spectrum makes it
              likely that the technology will find additional commercial application.
