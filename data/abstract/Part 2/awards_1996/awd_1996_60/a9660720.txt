              ***  ABSTRACT      9660720  Kaplan     This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will develop a multi-chip superconducting digital beamforming
              (DBF) system for ground station communications with satellites. DBF leads to a
              significant improvement in communication systems performance by enhancing the
              reception of signals from a number of specific directions. The increase in
              performance will lower the power required of satellite transmitters, thereby
              reducing payload weight. The novel digital communications technology under
              investigation enables beamforming for wide-band and spread-spectrum
              communications signals, which cannot be performed by present narrow-band
              systems. The reliance on digital rather than unclog components ensures higher
              signal fidelity and signal-to-noise. During the Phase I project, a Digital
              In-Phase and Quadrature converter (DIQC) will be developed for the proposed
              beamforming system. The digital IQ circuit will avoid the imbalances in gain,
              phase, and time delay experienced by conventional communications and RADAR
              systems. The digital signal processing elements for the DIQC circuits will
              utilize Rapid Single Flux Quantum (RSFQ) multipliers, accumulators, and other
              arithmetic logic circuits. These circuits have already been successfully
              demonstrated at HYPRES at multi-gigahertz frequencies. The multi-chip DBF
              system developed in Phase II will subsequently be commercialized in wide-band
              digital beamforming communications and RADAR systems, with bandwidths up to 2.5
              GHz at carrier frequencies up to 20 GHz.   Commercial applications of the
              technology under development include wide-band narrow-beam satellite
              communication links, secure communication systems, multi-functional conformal
              antennas arrays for surveillance, intercept, and tracking.  The digital signal
              processing functions developed in this program will benefit any application
              limited by processing speed, such as commercial spectrum analyzer and digitizer
              instruments, as well as digital electronic warfare s ystems. ***
