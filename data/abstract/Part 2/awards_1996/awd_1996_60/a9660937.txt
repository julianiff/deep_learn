Abstract    :
              ***  96-60937  Everitt     This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research
              project will develop a new material for giant magnetoresistive random access
              memory (GMRAM). Funding will be used for materials research and development, as
              well as fabrication of prototype arrays of GMRAM cells. The memory cells will
              operate in a manner similar to memories that employ anisotropic
              magnetoresistive (AMR) material, although the proposed material will have much
              higher signal due to the giant magnetoresistive (GMR) effect. Prior research by
              this proposer has identified problems with using standard GMR sandwich material
              for use in the AMR memory mode. GMRAM bits fabricated from standard GMR
              material have low write thresholds and fail upon repeated cycling and disturbs.
              The proposed novel material will overcome these limitations, and should result
              in very stable, robust memory cells. The simple cell architecture and fast read
              and write times should enable this type of memory to compete with commercial
              nonvolatile memories, as well as personal computer main memories.   GMRAM
              technology has the potential to be of major commercial significance in the
              future as a replacement for other nonvolatile memory technologies, and may be
              expected to extend to main memories in personal computers.  The potential
              market size is estimated to be quite large. This work will help to ensure
              continued U.S. leadership at the cutting edge of advanced magnetic memory
              research and development.  ***
