Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9660113  Kostecki     This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will develop a power electronic interface module to connect an
              energy source to an inverter system connected in parallel to the utility
              system. Specifically, this design effort will focus on such an interface module
              for connecting a superconducting energy storage (Micro-SMES) system to an
              inverter system. Higher magnet currents are needed to increase the power output
              level of Micro-SMES systems. Design objectives include the evaluation of
              different topologies and determination of the optimal solution. The ultimate
              power rating will be up in the 5 to 10 MW range.   One of the largest growing
              national and global areas for Micro-SMES systems is the power quality market.
              Power quality problems can be addressed in a range of customer locations or on
              the electric utility system. A Micro-SMES system with a new interface module
              offers a unique solution to these problems because of: 1) the ability to
              connect to a variety of inverters; 2) paralleling devices increases the power
              rating; and 3) this higher power rating combined with the parallel-connected
              inverters permits the development of applications at the utility distribution
              system voltage level. ***
