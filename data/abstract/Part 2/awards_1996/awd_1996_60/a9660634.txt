Abstract    :
              ***  96-60634  Vreeke     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              Project will develop a total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer suitable for long
              term, on-site monitoring.  The analytical technique relies on the quantitative
              oxidation of dissolved and suspended organics to carbon dioxide by the
              photocatalytic action of titanium dioxide.  The rapid equilibrium of the
              resulting carbon dioxide with carbonate species allows it to be detected by a
              conductivity measurement.  The presence of preexisting, conducting inorganic
              carbon species and dissolved ionic species will be accounted for using an
              additional conductivity measurement before the titanium dioxide-catalyzed
              photooxidation.  The sensing strategy will require a differential conductivity
              measurement.  The benefit to this analytical approach is the absence of
              consumables.  Size of the analyzer will be minimized by integrating the fluid
              handling and conductivity electrodes onto a silicon wafer.  This will be
              accomplished using a microlithography-created flow system and titanium dioxide
              reaction chamber.  The flow system's small dimensions and therefore small fluid
              volumes will drastically reduce the power requirements and allow the entire
              device to be contained in a portable unit.    Commercial applications are
              expected for sensors that enable rapid on-site determination of total organic
              carbon.  Such uses will be made in real-time monitoring in effluent streams
              from waste treatment sites, power generation facilities, and chemical
              processing plants.  ***
