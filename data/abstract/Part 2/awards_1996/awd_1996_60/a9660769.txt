Abstract    :
              ***  9660769  St. Amand     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will implement a novel Computerized Algal Identification System (CAIS)
              to automatically identify, measure and enumerate algal taxa.  Algae are
              sensitive indicators of stress in our national waters, yet algal data is
              difficult and expensive to obtain.  Producing reliable data requires
              experienced technicians to spend hours per sample with results varying widely
              due to differences in methodology and training.   The approach for this project
              unites an experienced algal ecologist with experts in image analysis to build a
              system initially capable of differentiating 11 genera.  CAIS will incorporate
              automated microscopy and image analysis to analyze cell shape, color (pigment),
              texture (cell content) and size.  Permanently mounted samples provide physical
              archives, solve orientation problems and retain characteristics necessary for
              identification and enumeration.  Digital image and data archives enable process
              monitoring, strict classification accountability, and interactive expert
              evaluation.     CAIS will significantly reduce processing time over current
              methods and ultimately increase laboratory capacities while decreasing
              measurement costs, and thus overcoming existing cost barriers to algal
              monitoring.  CAIS is versatile and extensible to other taxonomic groups as
              well.  Universities, government agencies, municipalities and consulting firms
              comprise a market conservatively estimated to generate over two million samples
              annually.  ***
