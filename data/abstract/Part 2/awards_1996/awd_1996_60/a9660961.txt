Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9660961  Chang     This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will develop a polarization independent (PI) wavelength
              division multiplexing cross-connect (WDMC) for all-optical communication
              network. At the core of the WDMC is a multiport acousto-optic tunable filter
              switch (MAOS). The salient features of the MAOS include: (a) a single device
              with multiple optical ports and a single electrical control input; (b) low
              drive power, narrow passband and low sidelobes; (c) capable of simultaneously
              and independently switching optical signals at different wavelengths and space
              division multiplexing (SDM) channels; and (d) scalable to a large number of
              channels and wavelengths. During Phase I, a feasibility model of the PI MAOS
              will be built and demonstrated. The system performance and limitations of the N
              x N WDMC using the MAOS as the building block will be analyzed.   The MAOS can
              be used as a gain equalizer for WDM amplifiers, to add a drop switch, and most
              generally, as a wavelength routing cross-connect for wideband fiberoptic
              communication. ***
