Abstract    :
              ***  96-60528  Downing     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
              I project will demonstrate the feasibility of using a monolithic capillary
              optic to enhance the capability of microfocus X-ray fluorescence (MXRF)
              instrumentation.  X-ray fluorescence is useful because of its ability
              nondestructively to perform elemental analysis on essentially any sample with
              high sensitivity.  In commercial MXRF instruments, spatial resolution is
              typically achieved by pinhole collimating, at the expense of greatly reduced
              flux and detection limits.  Multifiber polycapillary X-ray optics have a
              demonstrated capability to collect and focus X-rays; however, the spot size is
              typically 0.5 mm or larger.  Focusing monolithic (one-piece) multichannel
              capillary X-ray optics have just been developed.  By collecting a large solid
              angle from laboratory X-ray sources and focusing to less than 40 microns, they
              should provide greater performance, potentially increasing X-ray intensity by
              more than two orders of magnitude while decreasing the spot size compared to
              available MXRF systems.  This would improve detection limits, spatial
              resolution, working distance, and reduced measurement time.   Commercial
              applications include use a process monitoring system in predictive maintenance.
               Low cost installation, simple operation, and lower personnel requirements, as
              well as its capability to access non-traditional process variables, are
              expected to be commercially attractive.  In addition, improved microfocus X-ray
              fluorescence is expected to be used in many scientific disciplines, including
              geochemistry, mineralogy, environmental monitoring and remediation, biology,
              and advanced materials.  ***
