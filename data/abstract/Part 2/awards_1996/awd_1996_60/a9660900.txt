Abstract    :
              ***  96-60900  Martin     The proposed system will be used to recover otherwise
              wasted energy by transferring heat and moisture between the fresh ventilation
              air stream entering a building and the outgoing exhaust ventilation air. While
              performing this function, it will suppress the transfer of pollutants which
              would otherwise ride piggy-back atop the transferred moisture and thereby
              undermine the quality of the ventilation air. Present heat and moisture
              exchangers permit free transfer of pollutants between the air streams, and are,
              therefore, unsuitable for air-qualitysensitive applications. The current
              research objective is to obtain a thin, microporous film or selective
              semi-permeable membrane that will serve as the basis for an innovative,
              non-polluting, air-to-air exchanger. The selected material must permit high
              rates of water vapor transfer between two streams of air, but must prevent the
              transfer of airborne gaseous pollutants. Promising materials will be both
              acquired and fabricated, and their permeabilities to water vapor and four
              representative pollutants will be determined using novel mass transfer
              experiments.      This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              provide the technology base for a new type of energy recovery system. If
              successful, the research proposed here will significantly enlarge the
              opportunities for energy recovery in residential, commercial, and industrial
              ventilation applications.  ***
