Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9660219  DeCramer     This Small Business lnnovation Research
              Phase I project addresses the development of automated manufacturing for high
              frequency (5 MHz to 1 GHz) transformers and inductors. Current manufacturing
              processes are labor intensive. Magnetic core and wire diameters are very small
              (2.5 mm and 0.075 mm) making machine assembly impractical. The proposed
              approach uses automated techniques similar to semiconductor manufacturing to
              deposit, etch, and coat patterned layers of magnetic, conductive and insulating
              materials. This automation will significantly reduce labor content, further
              reduce device size, and enable economic production in the United States rather
              than offshore. Research objectives include completion of electrical and
              mechanical transformer design and fabrication of prototypes. Fundamental
              phenomena underlying device operation and electrical performance will be
              evaluated.   Commercial applications include high frequency transformers and
              inductors for data and video transmissions, hybrid circuits, and related
              circuitry.  Beyond existing markets, this new approach will enable development
              of miniature products in data and personal communications.  ***
