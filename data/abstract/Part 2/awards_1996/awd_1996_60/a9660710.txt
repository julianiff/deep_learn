Abstract    :
              ***  9660710  Tarr     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will explore the feasibility of peptide and protein sequencing coupled to high
              throughput mass spectrometry using a novel methodology resembling the Edman
              chemistry.   Preliminary experiments suggest that the several problems arising
              from the attempts by others to adapt the conventional Edman degradation to
              produce truncation sets ("ladders") for mass spectral analysis will be
              circumvented by this alternative chemistry based on carbon disulfide.  Issues
              of generality with respect to amino acid residues and to the physical/chemical
              characteristics of different peptides will be addressed.  Reaction conditions,
              control, consistency (repeatability, predictability), and adequate basis for
              later automation will be established and optimized.      Kits enabling this
              chemistry would be desirable to researchers using peptide maps and sequence
              information to identify novel proteins, confirm sequences predicted from the
              DNA, locate sites of post-translational or experimental modifications, analyze
              bioactive peptides, tie spots observed on 2D gels to information in DNA
              databases ("proteome" research), and provide quality control of recombinant
              proteins.   An automated instrument from Phase II would compete well with
              conventional Edman sequencers.    ***
