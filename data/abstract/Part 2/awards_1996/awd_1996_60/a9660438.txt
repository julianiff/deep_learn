Abstract    :
              ***  96-60438  Shah    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              Project will explore the use of semiconductor photodetectors to replace
              photomultiplier tubes in nuclear bore hole logging instrumentation.  Advantages
              are expected in more compact design, low power requirements, increased
              ruggedness, and insensitivity to magnetic fields.  Lead iodide is a promising
              detector material because its wide bandgap allows low noise operation at room
              temperature as well as at elevated temperatures.  These detectors have very
              good optical quantum efficiency and low power requirements.  Thus, lead iodide
              photodetectors coupled to scintillators are thought to be promising gamma-ray
              spectrometers for well logging.  Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of
              this concept by performing in-depth characterization of these photodetectors.  
               Commercial applications are expected in detectors for bore hole
              instrumentation and in various process control systems and nondestructive
              testing of materials. Other potential uses may be found in health care
              treatments and in scientific research.  ***
