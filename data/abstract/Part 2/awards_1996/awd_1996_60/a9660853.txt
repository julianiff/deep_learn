Abstract    :
              ***  96608253  Tang     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will develop an advanced process monitoring technique for the Chemical
              Mechanical Polishing (CMP) metal planarization process.  CMP planarization was
              primarily developed in the semiconductor industry in response to depth of focus
              budget problems and multilevel metalization problems.   Estimates are that the
              approximately $70 million CMP equipment market will grow to $300-400 million by
              1997.  The planarization capabilities of CMP provide significant relief to the
              Depth of Focus Budgets or current microlithographic tools and to process
              complexities of  multilevel interconnections.  ***
