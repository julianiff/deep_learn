Abstract    :
              ***  96-60326  Rosenthal     This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR)
              Phase I project will explore control of vibrations for front-end semiconductor
              manufacturing equipment, where micron precision is required.  This control is
              required at sub-Hertz (Hz) frequencies, where local seismic activity and
              disturbances in the manufacturing plant often cause vibrations of the
              supporting floor.  Presently available vibration isolation tables are not
              effective below 1 Hz.  A true multi-channel active feed-forward vibration
              controller is needed that minimizes the total positional error of manufacturing
              equipment being controlled.  Phase I will investigate a new method called
              SFR-SVD, meaning signal-free reference using singular value decomposition, to
              provide effective vibration isolation at micron resolution and sub-Hertz
              frequencies.  It is expected to reduce vibration by at least 20 decibels from
              0.1 Hz to 100 Hz.    Commercial application will be found in integrated circuit
              manufacturing facilities of the semiconductor industry. The cost of
              semiconductor foundry buildings may be significantly reduced.  ***
