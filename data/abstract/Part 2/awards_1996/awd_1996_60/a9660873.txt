Abstract    :
                 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at research
              and development of a new formaldehyde detector using recently introduced
              antimonide based near infrared diode lasers operating in the 2   3 micron
              region. The targeted specifications are a sensitivity of 0.1 part per million
              and an accuracy of 10% (at 1 ppm) for real time (1 second response time)
              measurement of formaldehyde in combustor exhaust. This sensor technology is
              readily adaptable for high sensitivity measurement of other key combustion
              pollutants including CO and NO. As a known carcinogen and contributor to air
              pollution (especially in urban air), formaldehyde emissions from automotive
              exhaust are now regulated in California. Formaldehyde emissions from combustors
              in electric power plants and municipal incinerators are also being targeted for
              regulation. In Phase I, the feasibility of the proposed diode laser based
              formaldehyde monitor will be demonstrated by constructing a prototype sensor
              and measuring trace concentrations of formaldehyde in turbulent combustor
              exhaust. The formaldehyde detection sensitivity in the combustor exhaust will
              be determined and the feasibility of commercially developing such a sensor will
              be evaluated.  Direct commercial applications of the research are expected to
              include improved instrumentation for real time measurement of numerous
              pollutant gases, including formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide.
              Additional applications include toxic gas detection for gases used in
              semiconductor fabrication.
