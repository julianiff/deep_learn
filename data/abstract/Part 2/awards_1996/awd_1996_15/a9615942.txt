Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP 9615942  NADELHOFFER  MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY    This
              project is designed to characterize climatic and environmental controls on
              carbon inputs to tundra soils from belowground sources and on carbon balances
              in tundra soils.  Specific objectives of this project include 1) quantifying
              root production and root-derived carbon fixation in wet sedge tundra, 2)
              assessing how global change influences both rates of carbon inputs from
              belowground sources to soils and the fate of these carbon inputs in arctic
              ecosystems, and 3) characterizing the fluxes of root-derived carbon across the
              soil-water-atmosphere interface under current and projected climatic
              conditions.  The carbon-labeled  experiments proposed here will permit
              measurements of plant carbon allocation to belowground production, fine root
              turnover, rates of carbon transfer from plants to soil and atmospheric pools,
              and rates of soil carbon turnover over timescales of days to years.  Without
              such research on belowground carbon dynamics, it will be difficult to develop
              realistic predictions of arctic ecosystem responses to climate and
              environmental change.
