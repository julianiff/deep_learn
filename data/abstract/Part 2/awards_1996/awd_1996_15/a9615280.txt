Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    96-15280  Lindow  Non-commensal interactions of epiphytic bacteria
              with plants.    The surfaces of healthy plants support large populations of
              bacteria thought to exist in a completely commmensalistic relationship with
              plants. These microbes are believed to passively utilize the nutrients that
              leak from the plant as carbon and energy sources.  This study aims to provide
              proof that the effect of bacteria on the leaf surface is not neutral-that
              microbial activities modify the microenvironment in ways that increase the
              nutrient resources available for microbial growth. Many epiphytic bacteria
              produce the plant growth regulator indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) which alters the
              availability of nutrients, presumably by altering the pattern of nutrient
              exudation from plants, and thus challenges the dogma that epiphytes exist in a
              truly commensalistic relationship with plants.  The approach will utilize
              molecular genetics techniques, looking for communicating signals in both
              directions (to the bacteria and to the plant).
