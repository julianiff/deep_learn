Abstract    :
                This study proposes to elucidate the dynamics of particle aggregation in the
              arctic ocean, particularly in the context of the rich conceptual background of
              polymer physics of marine biopolymers and colloidal polymer gels.  A major
              component of the global carbon pool is in the form of colloidal carbon, and the
              study of the processes that increase or decrease the reactivity of marine
              polymer gels is important in understanding the role of carbon transport and
              marine productivity.  The PIs plan to use dynamic laser scattering conditions
              that mimic those found in the ocean as a means to show whether biopolymers
              originating from the DOC (dissolved organic carbon) pool can spontaneously
              assemble into micrometer-size gels that can condense by phase transition and
              mineralization.  Results will be compared with the activity of cultures of
              Phaeocystis algae, an important natural contributor of biopolymers and polymer
              gels.
