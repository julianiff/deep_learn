Abstract    :
                Abstract  9615198  Deshler  The annual stratospheric ozone hole above
              Antarctica is driven by chlorine compounds which interact on the surfaces of
              the polar stratospheric clouds which form during the polar winter.  It is for
              this reason that the hole appears in the austral spring and that ozone
              depletion is much more severe in polar regions than elsewhere.  This
              investigation provides detailed information on the actual cloud particles and
              the distribution of the clouds and the ozone by using balloon borne
              instruments.  The measurements will provide vertical profiles of both the PSCs
              and ozone, size distributions of the PSC particles and some information on
              their composition and physical state (liquid or solid).  The project is
              enhanced by cooperation with an Italian investigator who operates a lidar
              system in McMurdo.  The project contributes to the WMO/UNEP Network for the
              Detection of Stratospheric Change and the Global Change Initiative.  ***
