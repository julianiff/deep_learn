Abstract    :
                This goal of this proposal is to convene two international workshops
              incorporating social and natural scientists in order to examine how small-scale
              societies, such as the Labrador Inuit, have responded to long- and short -term
              climate fluctuation in the North Atlantic region.  The collaborators all
              conduct research in the North Atlantic region and conceive of their individual
              study areas as regional monitoring sites in which chronology, climate,
              subsistence, and technological issues can be examined.  The study sites range
              from northern Greenland to Newfoundland.  This region is strongly influenced by
              El Nino effects, and ice core data afford exceptional climate records for
              comparisons with human settlement and resource changes over time.
