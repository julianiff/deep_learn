Abstract    :
              9615974  De La Ree         Advances in computerized systems, fast and reliable 
              communications, analysis and storing of large amounts of data  have given power
              engineers the ability to develop new protection  and control schemes to improve
              their existing power system.  GPS  synchronized measurements open new avenues
              of applications such  as adaptive relaying, advanced feed-back control
              techniques,  better estimation or determination of system losses and improved 
              state estimation determination of system losses and improved  state estimation
              of the power system.  Also, controlled  separation of power systems during
              emergency conditions using  phasor measurements has been studied and
              implemented.  Precise  measurement and oscillographic recordings are of great
              use in  analyzing system events, providing benchmarks for validating 
              simulation programs, and provide a diagnostic tool for power  equipment.      
              It is our hope that we can bring together the researchers,  utility engineers,
              manufacturers and other interested individuals  to promote an exchange of
              ideas, applications of these new  technologies, and identify new research
              areas.  The meeting  format will include one half day of tutorial presentations
               followed by one half day of presentations by authors of papers.   Papers from
              field engineers are sought, and will be mailed to all  participants in a bound
              conference proceedings within a month  after the conference. It is recognized
              that commercial  manufacturers of modern measuring and recording instruments,
              with  or without precise synchronization, have helped make this  technology a
              practical engineering option.  Several manufacturers  will exhibit their latest
              measuring and recording equipment  during the conference lunch breaks and after
              the technical  sessions.  ***
