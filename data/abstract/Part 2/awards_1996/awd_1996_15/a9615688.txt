Abstract    :
              9615688  Raviv       Supports initial exploration of an analog VLSI design for a
               novel, reduced-complexity task specific visual retina.  The  proposed retina
              generates specific quantitative information  about imminent threat of collision
              in real time, which can be  used as a powerful sensory feedback signal in
              closed-loop  control for autonomous navigation (e.g., collision avoidance) as 
              well as other tasks.  When dealing with a moving camera-based  autonomous
              navigation system, a huge amount of rapidly varying  visual data is captured.
              Processing all these data in real time  is a difficult task. There is a need to
              reduce the rapidly  varying video-rate images to a few signals that are
              relevant to  the tasks at hand.  The PI's ongoing research has resulted in 
              identification of several relevant visual motion cues, one of  which is the
              Visual Threat Cue (VTC). This cue can be viewed as  a mechanism to reduce the
              vast rapidly changing visual data to  one slowly-changing signal.  The proposed
              retina extracts the  VTC in a singlestage parallel operation.  It employs raw
              gray  level data directly to extract the VTC, i.e., without the need  for pre
              processing such as edge detection, segmentation, feature  tracking, optical
              flow, etc.  Potential applications include  realtime autonomous navigation, aid
              to visually-impaired people,  behavior-based robotics, and multi-eye agents.
