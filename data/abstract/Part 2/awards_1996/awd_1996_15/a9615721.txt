Abstract    :
              Harvey  9615721    Abstract    This award supports a meeting of the Meteorite
              Working Group  (MWG).  The purpose of the MWG is to formulate recommendations 
              for curatorial policies as well as review and recommend  allocation of
              meteorite samples that have been collected in  Antarctica with support from the
              U.S. Antarctic Program.  The MWG  was formed in 1977 in response to a
              Memorandum of Understanding  between the National Science Foundation, the
              National Aeronautics  and Space Administration, and the Smithsonian Institution
              as part  of an effort to ensure equitable distribution of meteorites for 
              research and educational purposes.  This award supports a meeting  of the MWG
              in the Fall of 1996.
