Abstract    :
              `Evaluating the Outcomes of Risky Options`.   Rational choice theory assumes
              that the utility derived from receiving an outcome as a result of a decision
              depends only upon the value of that outcome - winning $10 is the same whether
              the alternative possibility was winning $1000 or losing $1000.  As such,
              emotions such as regret or rejoicing, disappointment or elation, which
              inherently involve comparisons of what is with what might have been, play no
              role in choice.  In prior research, the PI has examined how such emotions
              influence individuals' feelings regarding the outcomes they receive.  The
              present proposal seeks funds to continue this research.  Specifically, three
              sets of experiments are outlined.  The first test implications of the model of
              emotion developed by the PI based on earlier research.  The second set of
              experiments examine the extent to which anticipated emotions may not only
              influence ex post evaluations of happiness or dissatisfaction with outcomes but
              also influence the decisions people make.  The final set of experiments examine
              the influence of anticipated emotions in richer and more diverse contexts.
