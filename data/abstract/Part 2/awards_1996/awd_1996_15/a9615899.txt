Abstract    :
                This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student
              from Southern Methodist University, studying the use of traditional medicine in
              a refugee camp in Sierra Leone, Africa.  The research will study the extent to
              which native, traditional healing is available in the camp, and the impact of
              such healing on health practices in general and the use of western medicine as
              provided by relief agency authorities. In thirteen months of ethnographic
              fieldwork in a displaced persons camp, involving a preliminary census, a random
              sample of 150 families as well as 20-30 administrators and biomedical camp
              personnel and 20 traditional healers, the student will conduct semi-structured
              interviews, illness histories, general oral life histories, as well as
              participant observation.  This data will be supplemented by information from
              aid agency documents.   This project is important because it will analyze how
              health care actually functions in a refugee camp.  Since over 45% of the
              world's 27 million refugees are in Africa, this case study will be important in
              addressing how agencies can improve health care by working with, rather than
              against the traditional healing systems of the impacted societies.  Through
              addressing the refugees' own role in constructing their health care systems,
              the study will correct the bias of western agencies' assumption that refugee
              populations are passive, helpless masses.  Thus the knowledge from this project
              will include the refugees own understanding of themselves and their situation.
              This will provide valuable information for planners to draw upon in designing
              aid programs.  In addition the project will add to the nation's expertise about
              this important region of the world.
