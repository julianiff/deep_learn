Abstract    :
              Bazzaz  9615298           Global environmental changes pose complex challenges 
              for plants.  Although some changes will occur within the  lifetime of extant
              plants, the response to these changes  will depend strongly on how populations
              behave.  How will  plant populations evolve in a change world?  How will global
               changes alter current evolutionary process?       The first focus will be on
              the direct selective effects  global change may exert.  The PIs will measure
              changes in  selective pressures in elevated CO2 and temperature  conditions in
              a weed, Abutilon theophrastii.  The PIs will  then subject 8 generations to
              these new selective pressures  to elucidate evolutionary response to global
              change.       Secondly, these conditions may alter response to  selective
              pressures currently found in the plant  environment.  Novel conditions are
              likely to alter the  developmental integration among traits, uncovering genetic
               potential for response to selection.  These potential  changes in the nature
              of correlations among traits may alter  the response of plant populations to
              selective pressures,  both by weakening tradeoffs among traits and by
              potentially  exposing new correlation among traits.  The effects of  elevated
              CO2 levels on the response to selection will be  investigated by imposing
              selection for particular traits in  8 generations.  These experiments will
              suggest how plant  populations will change under global change.
