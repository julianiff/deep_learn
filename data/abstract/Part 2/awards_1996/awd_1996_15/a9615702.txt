Abstract    :
                    Abstract  EEC-9615702  Christian    This award provides funding for
              continuing support for the University of Washington's Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for Process Analytical Chemistry (CPAC) for the
              next two years (two-year phase out).  After 12 years of operation, CPAC is a
              viable organization serving the needs of its industrial and governmental
              sponsors by continuing to discover and demonstrate new analytical methodologies
              for use as an integral part of automated chemical process monitoring and
              control.  The focus has been on relevant technical areas including: sensors,
              real-time measurement systems, adaptive multivariate calibration, and
              instrument standardization.  The main thrusts have been to create the
              analytical tools that not only provide direct chemical information, but also
              are integrated with sophisticated sampling, data processing, and intelligence
              capabilities.  These tools allow for real-time optimization and control to meet
              applicable requirements in product registration, regulatory requirements,
              productivity goals, quality management, and worker safety.
