Abstract    :
                Hays, Burckle, & Isley  9615060  This award supports research to better define
              the chronology of  iceberg calving from Antarctic ice sheets back to oxygen
              isotope  stage 11 (364-423 thousand-years before present (ka)).  Re- 
              assessment of published data for sediments deposited during the  last 100 ka
              suggests deposition of ice-rafted debris (IRD)  increased dramatically at 17,
              22, 63 and 84 ka in the Atlantic  and possibly the Indian sectors of the
              Southern Ocean.  The  regional extent of these IRD events will be tested, and
              others  will be identified for the last 500 ka by examining the sediment 
              record recovered in curated cores.  Age constraints will be  provided by
              biostratigraphy, chemostratigraphy (opal and  carbonate records) and oxygen
              isotope stratigraphy. However,  carbon-14 dates (using accelerator
              mass-spectrometry) will also  be acquired in critical cores.  The accumulation
              rate of  abiogenic sediment (63  m - 1 mm) will be assessed and its  lithology
              determined to derive IRD accumulation rates.  Preliminary mineralogical and
              geochemical analyses will attempt  to trace IRD to their source areas. 
              Findings will yield a high  resolution assessment of iceberg calving from
              Antarctic ice  sheets and allow insights to understanding such things as the 
              late Quaternary history of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.  This  study will also
              assess whether Southern Hemisphere ice caps  experienced melting episodes at
              timescales of 2-3 ka, as might be  inferred from records of atmospheric
              temperatures in Antarctic  Ice cores.  Furthermore, the timing of these
              Southern Ocean IRD  events will be compared with Heinrich Events in the
              Northern  Hemisphere.  Preliminary results suggest near-temporal  correlations
              between IRD deposition in the Southern Ocean and  Northern Hemisphere Heinrich
              Events 1, 2, 6 and an un-numbered  event at 84 ka.  For the two most recent
              events, Southern Ocean  IRD events appear to precede those of the Northern
              Hemisphere by  <3 ka.  A finding of strong temporal correlation bet ween
              iceberg  calving in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres would suggest  that
              external forcing rather than internal ice sheet dynamics  drove at least some
              of the Heinrich events.  On the other hand,  if Southern ocean IRD events
              preceded those of the Northern  Hemisphere, factors other than the North
              Atlantic salinity  oscillator must have impacted global climate at
              sub-Milankovich  timescales.
