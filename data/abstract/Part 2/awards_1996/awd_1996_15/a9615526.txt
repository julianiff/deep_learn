Abstract    :
              9615526  SHULTZ    Arthropods (spiders, crabs, insects and their relatives) have
              a long and complex history (phylogeny), and the greatest diversity in shape and
              form of all the animal groups.  In order to better understand how these
              complex, and often economically important, animals actually work, it is
              important to know how they are put together; it is especially important to know
              how muscles are attached to the hardened outer surface (exoskeleton) of each
              animal, forming Oskeletomuscular complexesO that permit the animals to move,
              feed, and reproduce.  Certain skeletomuscular complexes may have occurred only
              once in the histories of arthropods; others, which may look alike and function
              in a similar way, may have appeared in several different places in the
              arthropod phylogenetic tree.  However, since not enough information has yet
              been obtained to determine the true phylogeny of arthropod groups, it is, at
              present, difficult to assess whether particular skeletomuscular complexes
              appeared once or more than once in arthropod history.    In this study, Jeffrey
              W. Schultz will examine the details of skeletomuscular complex structures in a
              major group of arthropods, the arachnids (spiders, scorpions, mites and their
              relatives).  He will use skeletomuscular characters, both alone and with
              molecular sequence data, to reconstruct the phylogeny of the arachnids, and
              will then use the phylogeny to estimate when, how, and how often particular
              skeletomuscular complexes appeared in arachnids, and how these complexes
              changed, in form and function, throughout the history of these animals.  It is
              expected that this analysis will solve long-standing problems in the phylogeny
              and evolutionary morphology of an important group of arthropods.
