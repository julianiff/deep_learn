Abstract    :
                Warner  9615516         Results of studies on biogeography and population
              ecology   of marine organisms suggest that larval transport and   recruitment
              are important process in determining the   distribution and persistence of
              adult populations. Our   understanding of these processes, however, is severely
                limited by our inability to determine the sources and   subsequent dispersal
              patterns of marine larvae. Dr. Warner   hypothesizes that spatial variation in
              water chemistry among   potential source populations, both in terms of isotopic
                ratios and elemental concentrations, can be used to   discriminate between
              recruitment events resulting from larval   retention versus dispersal between
              populations. This can be   achieved if larvae permanently record the
              environmental   signature of their location of origin. He will test this  
              hypothesis by comparing the otolith chemical composition of   newly settled
              recruits to resident adults from populations   with different chemical
              environments.   ***
