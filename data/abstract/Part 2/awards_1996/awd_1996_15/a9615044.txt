Abstract    :
              9615044  Billah  Wind-induced vibrations of flexible structures occur in 
              variety of practical cases ranging from tall buildings to  transmission towers.
               It is well known that the response of  many structures in a direction
              perpendicular to the flow is  more complex since vortices are usually shed in
              the wake,  not only for quasi-steady (deterministic) conditions but  also in
              the presence of natural turbulence.  The  corresponding structural response
              calculations have been  fraught with difficulty since the vortex-structure 
              interaction mechanism is not very well understood.  A  conceptual understanding
              that has emerged recently is that  vortex-induced vibration is initiated due to
              the creation of  parametric instability condition.  the concept has received 
              substantial support from experimental results as well as  from  analytical
              calculations.  The present research  initiative will rigorously  try to
              validate the parametric  instability condition and its various  ramifications
              from  fundamental fluid-structure understanding.
