Abstract    :
              Abstract  9615033  Goodman    This award provides funding for an
              NSF/Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Wireless Information
              Networks (WINLAB) at Rutgers University and support of an undergraduate student
              to participate in the research of the Center.    The research activities of the
              Center will contribute to the rapidly expanding technologies of wireless
              communications and mobile computing. The research proposed for the next five
              years of support is motivated by an analysis of personal communications in the
              year 2010.  Projects that will be undertaken will build on research conducted
              in the first five years of WINLABOs operation and are in the categories of
              network architecture, mobile computing, radio resource management, access
              technologies, and mobility management. The Center will continue to collaborate
              with its thirty corporate and government sponsors and it is expected that this
              support will grow.    Additional funding is provided in this award to support a
              minority undergraduate  student for the summer to conduct a study on an ongoing
              research project within the Center.
