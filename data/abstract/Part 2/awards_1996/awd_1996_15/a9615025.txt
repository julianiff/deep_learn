              Astronomical Studies with the Caltech Submillimeter  Observatory    This award
              supports research, technological development and  student education at the
              Caltech Submillimeter Observatory  (CSO).  The Observatory consists of a
              precision 10.4m antenna  enclosed in  a dome located near the summit of Mauna
              Kea, Hawaii. The  CSO's  mission is to carry out spectroscopic and continuum 
              observations  of astronomical objects in the wavelength range 1mm-350 mm;  the 
              opacity of the Earth's atmosphere to radiation at these  wavelengths is the
              reason for the observatory's location at  an  altitude of nearly 4,300m. The
              observatory was constructed  with  funds from the National Science Foundation
              (NSF) during the  period  1984-1987. The CSO is presently the only US facility
              capable  of  operations throughout the full submillimeter atmospheric  window. 
                Over the next three years, the CSO will focus on three major  goals:    1. 
              The detection and study of the interstellar medium in  distant  and possibly
              primeval galaxies.  2.  The study of star formation in the interstellar medium,
               particularly the very early stages of the process.  3. The extension of
              previously-successful Sunyaev-Zel'dovich  measurements to a wide range of
              galaxy clusters to allow  estimates  of the Hubble constant.
