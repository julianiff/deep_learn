Abstract    :
              9615634  Ekstrom   This award provides one-half the funding for the acquisition
              of computing equipment to upgrade the computer facility for research in
              seismology in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard
              University. The remaining funds required for the acquisition will be provided
              by Harvard University. The upgrade will allow the Harvard seismology group to
              write and make use of  numerically intensive seismic wave propagation codes to
              study global and regional internal Earth structures.  ***
