Abstract    :
              9615306  Messac   This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to examine the
              use of language in the engineering design literature.  Engineering design has
              failed to emerge clearly as an engineering discipline in part because it has
              been impeded by a lack of a clear lexicon for   communication, and researchers
              in the field have been reluctant to create a lexicon.  Indeed, the current use
              of language in design encompasses a broad range of disparate definitions for
              some key words.  In a few cases, the same researcher has used a word repeatedly
              in a single paper, each time with a substantially different definition.  The
              research funded under this grant will survey the design literature and provide
              and publish a collection of definitions for words that are key to the field.  
              It is hoped that, by providing a list of words key to the field of engineering
              design together with the disparate definitions assigned to them by different
              researchers, the engineering design research community will obtain a clearer
              view of the confusion created by this chaotic situation.  This effort could
              form the basis of a dialog that will result in better communication among
              researchers in the field and subsequently improve the efficacy of research in
              the field.  Clarity of language in itself can also lead to better design
              education and improved design tools.  All of these factors contribute to the
              success   of American industry.
