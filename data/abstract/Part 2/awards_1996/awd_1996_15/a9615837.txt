Abstract    :
                This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student
              from the University of Kentucky.  The project will examine the changing
              patterns of women's labor and household health practices in an Appalachian
              Kentucky country experiencing an increase in women's wage labor participation. 
              Using ethnographic techniques of participant observation, structured in-depth
              interviewing, and diaries in which women record health incidents in their
              households, the student will describe and analyze the new strategies women
              develop to comply with their responsibilities to care for the health of their
              households while at the same time working in the labor market.   This research
              is important as it will advance our understanding of how the human capital of
              households is being affected by the global processes of economic restructuring,
              whereby women are entering the labor market.  Understanding how women are
              coping with the new demands on their services will enable policy-makers to
              design programs to maintain the health of families while enabling women to be
              productive in the wage market.
