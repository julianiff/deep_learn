Abstract    :
              Wilson: OPP 9615639  Bell: OPP 9615773  Finn: OPP 9618568    Abstract  This
              award supports an investigation of the structure of the  Transantarctic
              Mountains (TAM) in southern Victoria Land,  Antarctica.  The regional
              architecture of a key segment of the  TAM - West Antarctic rift system boundary
              will be mapped to help  resolve outstanding questions about the evolution of
              the TAM in  southern Victoria Land.  This collaborative research program will 
              integrate new aeromagnetic data, to be acquired by a cooperative  U.S.-German
              field campaign, with satellite imagery, geological  and structural mapping, and
              existing ground-based, airborne, and  marine geophysical data.  This integrated
              data base will be used  to map large-scale structural elements of the crust of
              the TAM  and adjacent ice-covered regions.  The first large-scale  structural
              framework for the TAM rift accommodation zone in  southern Victoria Land will
              be generated by this program.  This  framework will be used to test hypotheses
              for the geometry of the  TAM rift flank, the kinematic and dynamic history of
              the rift  boundary, the patterns of magmatism during Jurassic and Cenozoic 
              rift development, the geometry of the early Paleozoic convergent  Ross orogen
              margin, and the role of this ancestral margin in  Mesozoic-Cenozoic rift-flank
              development.  Resolution of these  issues will contribute significantly to
              understanding the  tectonic development of the region.
