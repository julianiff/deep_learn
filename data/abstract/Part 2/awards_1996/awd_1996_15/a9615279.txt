Abstract    :
              ***  9615279  Martinson   The proposed work is an extended analysis of a data
              set generated as part of an integrated research program ("Anzflux") into the
              oceanographic structure of upper mixed layer of the eastern Weddell Sea.  It
              was carried out from the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer in the austral winter of
              1994.  The work proposed here concerns the integration of  hydrographic and
              geochemical tracer data to determine the three-dimensional oceanic structure on
              various spatial scales for the validation of oceanic models, and specifically
              to determine the magnitude of the heat flux from the ocean to the atmosphere.  
              The eastern Weddell Sea is a region where a warm regime, defined by the
              intrusion of warm circumpolar deep water with temperatures near +1 deg C, and a
              cold regime exist side by side.  The cold regime occurs to the west, where deep
              water is overlain by a thick near-freezing mixed layer. In both regions however
              enough heat is seasonally carried to the sea ice to melt it completely.     The
              specific objective of the proposed work is to improve our understanding of how
              the intense mixing events associated with frequent storms affect the structure
              and seasonal evolution of  the upper layers of the ocean and the sea ice cover.
               The structure of the upper layers in turn affects the stability of the deeper
              ocean, and determines the depth of convection and the longer term variability
              in temperature and salinity of the deep ocean.  ***  ??
