Abstract    :
              9615533  Pryer   In a three-institution collaboration with colleagues at Utah
              State University and at University of California at Berkeley, Dr. Kathleen
              Pryer of Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History is amassing a major database
              of molecular and morphological characters of representatives of the 30 or so
              families of living ferns, in order to construct an overall phylogenetic
              framework for ferns. Building upon the impressive results of a 1994 symposium
              of fern specialists, with an international team that produced preliminary
              results for this effort (published in 1995), Pryer and her colleagues are
              continuing a major DNA sequencing project for four genes, two from the
              chloroplast genome and two from the nucleus, that hold promise of yielding
              informative variation for genealogical analyses. This molecular database in
              turn is to be supplemented with traditional anatomical and morphological
              features drawn from the vegetative and reproductive parts of the same ferns
              analyzed for their DNA, features used standardly in their taxonomic
              identification and classification.   A well-resolved phylogeny for ferns will
              facilitate future work on the patterns and sequences of character evolution in
              ferns, and on the Cretaceous radiation and diversification of the major group
              of ferns, the "polypodiaceous" group. A phylogenetic framework will provide a
              foundation for family- and genus-level taxonomic revisionary research. Using
              comparative methods, researchers can explore patterns of association among
              characters for correlated evolutionary changes, that may help explain the
              success or failure (extinction) of various lineages within the ferns.
