Abstract    :
              9615809  Klein    This project will investigate the effects of systemic
              initiatives  on student achievement.  Selected projects from NSF's SSI, USI and
               LSC will be identified in collaboration with NSF (nine in all).   Data will be
              collected to determine if students in these sites, who  have received program
              reforms, score higher on relevant achievement  measures, and other outcomes,
              than do comparable students from  other schools.  Achievement will be measured
              on currently available  tests in each site.  A second analysis will examine the
               relationship between student success and the degree of  implementation of
              systemic reform.  RAND will conduct common data  analysis across the sites,
              building a mosaic of evidence about the  impact of systemic reform on student
              achievement in each site.
