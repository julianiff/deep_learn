Abstract    :
              9615760  PIERCE    The Miletinae, a subfamily of butterflies (Lepidoptera),
              currently contains many species that are predatory or parasitic.  Most of these
              species prey on aphids, ants or scale insects, and several are used as
              biological control agents in different parts of the world.  If the subfamily is
              monophyletic, then it represents the largest group of closely-related predatory
              and parasitic species within the Lepidoptera.    In this research, Naomi Pierce
              will use molecular characters from both mitochondrial and nuclear genes to
              recontruct the phylogenetic relationships among the four tribes and thirteen
              genera of the Miletinae.  The results should determine whether the subfamily is
              monophyletic, provide insight into how unusual feeding habits such as carnivory
              appeared among insects that, for the most part, eat plants, and why species
              with such unusual feeding habits have succeeded in this group of butterflies
              but not in others.  The work will also contribute to our understanding of
              diversification within the butterfly family Lycaenidae, to which the Miletinae
              belongs.
