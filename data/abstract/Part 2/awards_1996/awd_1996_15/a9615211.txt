Abstract    :
              9615211  BURRESON    The phylum Annelida is an extremely diverse assemblage of
              terrestrial, freshwater and marine worms.  The phylum is divided into two main
              groups.  In one group, which includes the branchiobdellidans, hirudinea
              (leeches) and oligochaetes (earthworms and relatives), the worms have a
              glandular clitellum that secretes a protective cocoon around the eggs.  In the
              other, which includes the polychaetes, the worms lack a clitellum.  Although
              the ecological significance of the hirudinean and oligochaete worms is well
              established, they are among the most poorly studied invertebrates with respect
              to their historical relationships (phylogeny).    In this study, Eugene
              Burreson and colleagues will collect data from morphology and from both
              mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences, and use these data to reconstruct the
              phylogeny of non-polychate annelids.  Analyses will include separate
              investigations of relationships among leeches, among branchiobdellidans, and
              among oligochaetes, as well as more inclusive analyses involving all
              individuals in all three groups.  The latter analysis should answer
              long-standing questions on the origin of the branchiobdellidans and leeches
              from oligochaete or polychaete ancestors.  The research should yield robust
              phylogenies that serve as a foundation for subsequent studies on the life
              history patterns of these organisms.
