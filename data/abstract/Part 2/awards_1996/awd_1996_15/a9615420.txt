Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a four year program to study the  basal conditions
              of ice stream D using techniques previously  applied to ice stream B.  The
              objective is to determine whether  the physical conditions and processes to be
              observed by borehole  geophysics at the base of this large ice stream are
              consistent  with what has been observed at ice stream B and to point to a 
              common basal mechanism of ice streaming.  This project includes a  comparison
              between two parts of ice stream D, an upstream reach  where flow velocities are
              modest (about 80 meters/year) and a  downstream reach of high velocity (about
              400 meters/year).  The  comparison will help to reveal what physical variable
              or  combination of variables is mainly responsible for the streaming  flow. 
              The variables to be monitmred by borehole observation  include basal water
              pressure, basal sliding velocity, flow  properties and sedimentological
              characteristics of subglacial  till if present, ice temperature profile
              including basal water  transport velocity, connection time to the basal water
              system,  basal melting rate and others.
