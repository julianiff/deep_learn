Abstract    :
              9615163  HONEYCUTT    Rodents represent a major component of mammalian diversity
              worldwide.  They demonstrate considerable variation in morphology, habitat
              utilization, behavior, life history strategies, and biogeographic distribution.
               At the DNA sequence level, rodents demonstrate faster overall rates of change
              than seen for other groups of mammals, and this increase in nucleotide
              substitution rate has been linked to differences in generation time and overall
              mutation rates.      The purpose of this research, to be conducted by Rodney
              Honeycutt, is twofold.  First, nucleotide sequence data from three nuclear
              genes and one mitochondrial gene will be used to investigate relationships
              among rodents in the suborder Histricognathi.  This suborder encompasses a
              large subset of rodent diversity, including a majority of rodent families. 
              Histricognath rodents occur primarily in Africa and South America, and within
              South America they represent an unique part of the mammalian radiation. 
              Second, these nucleotide sequence data and the resulting gene trees will be
              used to examine patterns of change at the molecular level.  Some of the
              patterns to be investigated pertain to correlation's between heterogeneity in
              the rate of nucleotide substitution and several parameters including body size,
              metabolic rate, and generation time.  In an effort to determine whether or not
              rodent genes experience different classes of substitutions relative to other
              mammals, both the distribution of nucleotide substitutions throughout each gene
              and rates of change in all these genes will be compared to those seen in other
              non-rodent mammal groups.
