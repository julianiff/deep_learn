Abstract    :
              DMI-9615971  Shahinpoor   The award supports the 4th International Conference on
              Environmentally Conscious Design and Manufacturing (ECDM'96) to be held in
              Cleveland, Ohio from   July 23 through July 26, 1996.  This conference is
              organized to have national and international representatives from academia,
              industry, government, and trade associations to discuss key issues in
              environmentally conscious design and manufacturing.  Two important issues will
              be addressed: (1.) progress of science and engineering in environmentally
              conscious design and manufacturing, and (2.) integration of research and
              education in environmentally conscious design and manufacturing.  The main
              purpose of the conference is to disseminate fundamental research information on
              environmentally conscious design and manufacturing to the manufacturing
              industries and academe.   The PI and his colleagues have organized the ECMD in
              the past three years, and the feedback from participants was well received. 
              The PI has a well-organized plan and meeting agenda for the conference.  The
              invited speakers and attendees are wee-respected leaders from industry and
              academic institutions.  A proceeding will be put together by the Conference for
              the report.
