Abstract    :
              9615357  Vidale      This grant provides $47,000 as one-half of the costs of
              acquiring  computer equipment for the UCLA Department of Earth & Space 
              Sciences for use in seismological and geodetic research.  Equipment to be
              purchased will include, multiple SUN  workstations, one high end SUN
              workstation dual processors and  expanded memory and disk storage and
              additional peripherals. This  equipment will greatly enhance the research
              capabilities of a  large group at UCLA which conducts a broad range of
              geophysical  research that is computationally intensive.  Studies that will 
              utilize the new computer network will include, modeling of  earthquake
              clustering determined from seismic data and  displacement data determined from
              GPS measurements in an attempt  to provide earthquake forecasts, the nature of
              seismicity based  on analysis of fault geometry and rock types, statistical 
              analysis of pre-seismic, co-seismic and post-seismic data to aid  in
              understanding the spatial and temporal nature of seismic  risks, determination
              of seismic energy from analyses of broadband  digital seismograms to aid in the
              understanding of deep focus  earthquake physics within subduction zones,
              seismic tomography  via analysis of PASSCAL data to examine mantle dynamics
              beneath  areas of active rifting (i.e. East African Rift, Baikal Rift) and 
              studies of the lateral heterogeneity of near-surface seismic  velocities from
              the Landers earthquake in southern California.  ***
