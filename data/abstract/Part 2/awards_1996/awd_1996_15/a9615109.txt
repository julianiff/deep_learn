Abstract    :
              This project analyzes child survival and health in a tropical forest society of
              Amazonian Venezuela.  The project will analyze census data collected over 36
              years for the Bari tribe to assess the contribution to a child's survival of
              `secondary fathers` -- men who had societal-recognized extra-marital affairs
              with the child's mother and who are believed to have contributed to the
              development of the fetus, and thus have parental rights and obligations. 
              Preliminary data show that some children's secondary fathers seem to contribute
              enough resources to improve their life chances over the survival prospects for
              their own siblings; but data also show that some women who never recognize
              secondary fathers have children whose survival prospects are equally good  The
              project will test the hypothesis that a women's adult siblings and fathers can
              provide support which ensures her children's survival.   This research is
              important because it corrects a bias in the theory of human evolution which
              stresses the importance of women, specifically grandmothers, to the survival of
              children.  This research will assess the role of men, including grandfathers,
              in a child's survival.  Most policy oriented discussion of the importance of
              male kin focuses on the father, and presumes that for each child only one
              father is recognized.  This ethnographic case in which multiple fathers are
              societal recognized will show how maternal grandfathers and uncles can
              substitute for fathers in major ways.  This ethnographic example is important
              for sorting out what is constant and panhuman about the male contribution to
              children, and what is culturally variable and contingent on environmental
              circumstances.
