Abstract    :
              9615689  Lumelsky        This award funds exploration of a novel sensor-based 
              approach to disassembly planning for complex assemblies.  Knowledge of part and
              tool kinematics and available tools, and  procedures for disassembling a
              complex assembly could aid the  designer in producing a more maintainable
              system or structure.  The planned approach operates with incomplete
              information,  enabling a computationally efficient answer to the formal 
              question of existence of a path for removal of a given part from  a complex
              assembly.  This exploratory effort should show the way  to the formulation of
              the more general questions for design such  as how the kinematic constraints as
              well as tool and system  maintenance procedure availability can be accommodated
              in design  and planning.Incorporation of such knowledge in the original  design
              process could also facilitate human performance of  disassembly operations in
              some cases.
