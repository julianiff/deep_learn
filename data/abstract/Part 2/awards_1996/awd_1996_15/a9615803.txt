Abstract    :
              ***  9615803  Warrington      This grant provides funding to enable eight
              graduate students to attend and participate in the Engineering Foundation
              Workshop on the Commercialization of Microsystems `96.  This workshop will
              focus on issues related to the commercialization of technologies emerging in
              the field of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).  The field has emerged over
              the past ten years, largely under NSF funding, and an industry totaling about
              $4 billion per year has grown based on the technology.  But considerable
              additional growth is expected.  The workshop discussions will focus on the
              barriers to continued commercialization of MEMS and to the lowering of these
              barriers.  Students will be selected using a competitive process.        This
              grant will enable graduate student participation in this workshop, thereby
              providing a broad exposure to commercialization issues in an area of emerging
              technology.  This exposure should enable students to make greater contributions
              to the field and to the commercialization of the technology upon their
              graduation.  The field is becoming a major employer of engineering graduates
              and should contribute very substantially to the creation of new jobs over the
              next 20 years.    ***
