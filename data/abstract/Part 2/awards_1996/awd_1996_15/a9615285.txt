Abstract    :
              This award provides support for one year of funding to perform  carbon-14
              analyses on samples (seal skin and Adamussium colbecki  shells) collected in
              firm stratigraphic position within numerous  raised beaches along the Scott
              Coast of the western Ross Sea,  Antarctica.  These measurements will enable the
              development of a  radiocarbon chronology and will result in detailed relative
              sea-  level curves for five separate localities along the Scott Coast.  These
              relative sea-level curves will help to constrain the timing  of deglaciation in
              the western Ross Sea.  During the last  glaciation, West Antarctic ice expanded
              into the Ross Sea, merged  with East Antarctic ice emanating from outlet
              glaciers in the  Transantarctic Mountains, and extended to (or close to) the
              edge  of the continental shelf.  With an accurate, well-constrained  chronology
              for ice recession in the western Ross Sea, those  factors that could have
              triggered deglaciation and hence may have  controlled the extent of the West
              Antarctic ice sheet will be  able to be evaluated.
