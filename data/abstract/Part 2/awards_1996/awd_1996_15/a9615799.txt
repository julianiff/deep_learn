Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9615799    Principal Investigator:  Jin Au Kong    Title: 
              Analytical and Monte Carlo Studies on Electromagnetic Interactions with
              Nonspherical Dense Media    In this research, a basic theoretical and
              computational investigation of methods which are adequate for use in situations
              where nonspherical complexity is introduced in electromagnetic interactions
              with terrain-type scatterers (remote sensing) is proposed.  This is a
              nontrivial outstanding problem.  Almost all branches of remote sensing,
              terrain, atmospheric and ocean, will benefit from an effective formulation
              which includes this realistic effect. Remote sensing, as part of the general
              field of global resource assessment, is felt to be a strong area, which is
              vital to the United States.
