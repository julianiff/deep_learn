Abstract    :
              CTS-9615649  Elias Frances  Purdue University    The surface tension of several
              aqueous systems of surfactant and surfactant/protein  mixtures is examined, to
              find out how components of different size, surface activity, or molecular
              character compete for the air/water surface.  New models for both equilibrium
              and dynamic adsorption of mixtures are developed.  To test the models, several
              optical and spectroscopic tools are used to obtain compositional and
              microstructural information:  external-reflection infrared spectroscopy (IR)
              from air/water surface monolayers; ATR-IR (total reflection) spectroscopy from
              monolayers (LB films) transferred on solid substrates; ellipsometry at several
              wavelengths; and radiotracer methods.  The objectives are to develop
              quantitative guidelines on how the mixture composition and the molecular
              structures of the components can be tailored to control the dynamic surface
              tension behavior.  Dispersions of sparingly soluble particulate surfactants and
              their equilibrium and dynamic adsorption are used to rationalize how foam
              stability and surfactant concentrations in the foamate are related to bulk
              composition, and to foam-based separations.  The project also has a biomedical
              engineering focus:  several specific surfactants and lipids with applications
              or potential applications as lung surfactant replacement drugs are examined to
              delineate the best conditions for achieving the very low 10 mNm nonequilibrium
              surface tensions (under pulsating are conditions) required for proper alveoli
              function.
