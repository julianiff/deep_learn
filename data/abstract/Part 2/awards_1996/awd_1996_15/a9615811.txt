Abstract    :
                  This award is to Cornell University and the IBM Research Division to 
              develop workstation telephony.  The project will create methods for  carrying
              telephony over an integrated services network.  In addition, a  key result from
              this project will be the ability to interconnect that  network transparently
              with existing PBX-based system and the world  telephony network.  In this
              effort, Cornell will build on its success  in creating technology for low-cost
              pervasive QoS-capable networks  (Cells in Frames), and on its success in
              creating a useable and widely  deployed communications application (CU-SeeMe).
