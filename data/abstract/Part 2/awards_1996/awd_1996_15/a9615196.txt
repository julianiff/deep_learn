Abstract    :

              ABSTRACT        The principal investigator proposes an experimental study of
              the effects bulk flow pulsations have on film cooling.  The work is relevant to
              heat transfer in gas turbine engines.  A low speed wind tunnel will be used to
              generate a boundary-layer flow over a flat plate where film cooling could be
              introduced.   Bulk flow pulsations will be generated by an array of rotating
              shutters located at the exit of the test section.  Injectant distributions will
              be determined by flow visualization using a video camera and smoke or fog
              introduced into the flow stream.  Heat transfer coefficients at the test
              surface will be deduced from thermocouple data and heat flux data.   Hot wire
              anemometers, pressure probes, and temperature probes are available for
              obtaining flow information in the boundary layer.
