Abstract    :
              DMS 9615912  Scott    This research will bring together a small number of
              participants  in a workshop entitled "Advances in Smoothing:  Bumps, Jumps, 
              Clustering, and Discrimination."  The workshop will include  leading
              authorities in several areas, together with other  researchers and students,to
              share recent findings that  potentially impact other fields.  Recent advances
              in  nonparametric smoothing could aid workers in clustering improve  the
              statistical foundations of their algorithms.  Technology  for identifying
              change points or jumps may help determine the  weight of evidence in favor of
              numbers of clusters.  Finally,  recent advances in nonparametric regression
              technology have  dramatically changed the face of algorithms for statistical 
              discrimination, which is closely related to clustering.  The  workshop will
              have 3 or 4 leaders, with numerous breakouts for  investigating possible
              interfaces and technology or theoretical  transfers.  In addition, young
              researchers, including faculty and  graduate students, will be invited to
              participate.  The workshop  will accommodate as many as 25-50 participants.   
              This research will support participation in a workshop entitled  "Advances in
              Smoothing:  Bumps, Jumps, Clustering, and  Discrimination."  Participants will
              include leading authorities  in these areas, together with other researchers
              and students.   The workshop will provide a forum for the sharing of recent 
              findings that potentially impact these other fields.  These  statistical
              techniques are widely used in science:  for example,  the discovery of the top
              quark, signal processing for speech  recognition, detection of production
              quality in manufacturing, to  name just a few.  The workshop will have 3 or 4
              leaders.  In  addition, young researchers, including faculty and  graduate
              students, will be invited to participate.  The workshop  will accommodate 25-50
              participants.
