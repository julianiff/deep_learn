Abstract    :
              9615316  Grotjahn    Dr. Grotjahn will conduct a study aimed at better
              understanding the dynamics of  midlatitude extratropical cyclones. 
              Specifically, he will look at the development  processes that occur within a
              cyclone's life cycle using several different numerical  models, each of which
              uses a set of equations which approximates actual atmospheric   dynamics based
              on its own set of simplifying assumptions.  Dr. Grotjahn will  compare the
              evolution of cyclone in each of these models, including how various  terms of
              the equations evolve with time, and assess the model's effectiveness in 
              representing the behavior of the real atmosphere.  The focus of this effort
              will be a  comparison of nonmodal growth processes and traditional baroclinic
              instability  processes.  Model results also will be compared with analyses of
              observations.  The  research will be done in collaboration with Dr. Joseph
              Tribbia of the National Center  Atmospheric Research.  ***
