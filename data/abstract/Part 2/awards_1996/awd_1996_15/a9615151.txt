              ABSTRACT    96-15151  Schoener  Species Diversity and Abundance in Insular
              Systems    This is a long-term experimental and observational study of food
              webs in islands of the Bahamas. A particular species in a food web may affect
              other species' abundances directly, via predation (predators reduce prey and,
              correspondingly, prey increase predators) or indirectly, via other species
              (e.g. predators may help plants indirectly by eating their herbivores). 
              Previous experiments manipulated smaller predators to determine their direct
              and indirect effects.  The proposed two experiments manipulate larger
              predators.  First, large lizards will be introduced to places having smaller
              lizards.  Second, birds and smaller lizards will be excluded in a crossed
              design.  The two types of larger predators should differ fundamentally in their
              effects, particularly on plants:  the former eat smaller predators, whereas
              birds also eat prey of the smaller predators,  especially herbivorous insects. 
              Additionally, immigrations (natural "introductions") and extinctions (natural
              "removals") on over 100 islands will be monitored to determine their frequency
              and long-term effects.
