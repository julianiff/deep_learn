Abstract    :
              9615661  Hunter  This project will investigate the short term effects of
              Hurricane Opal on ecosystem processes at the Coweeta LTER site, North Carolina.
              The hurricane was a rare and dramatic event that resulted in considerable
              deposition of woody detritus and green leaves on the forest floor. The rare
              nature of this event, and the need to initiate studies of its effects as soon
              as possible, make this research well suited for SGER funding.     This research
              will investigate the short-term effects of hurricane-derived greenfall on
              nutrient availability and decomposition processes on the forest floor. The
              investigators will test the prediction that loss of green leaf tissue from
              hurricane Opal will influence the carbon-nutrient balance of trees because
              nutrients were not resorbed for internal recycling prior to senescence. Rather,
              nutrients were lost to the forest floor. The nutrient stress caused by the loss
              of green tissue may result in high carbon:nutrient ratios in trees, and the
              allocation of carbon to tannins and other polyphenols instead of allocation to
              growth. This allocation of carbon to defenses may influence the subsequent
              quality of leaf tissue for herbivores, and levels of defoliation in the forest
              canopy.    This project represents a unique opportunity to study the effects of
              altered ecosystem processes on plant physiology and plant herbivore dynamics
              following an extreme climatic event.
