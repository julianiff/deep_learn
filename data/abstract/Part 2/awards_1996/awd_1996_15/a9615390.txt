Abstract    :
              9615390  KOOYMAN  The emperor penguin is one of seventeen species of penguins 
              and the only one to breed during the extreme Antarctic  winter, when
              temperatures can drop to below -50 degrees  centigrade and winds can reach 300
              kilometers per hour. The  total number of emperor penguins is unknown because
              new  colonies are still begin discovered. Current population  estimates range
              from 135,000 to 175,000 breeding pairs,  living at about 40 sites on the
              sea-ice margin of  Antarctica. Seven of these colonies are in the Ross Sea, 
              where Gerald Kooyman has been studying the physiology and  ecology of emperor
              penguins since the early 1960's. This  project will focus on data analysis and
              synthesis from this  long term study. Work will focus on physiological
              adapations  pertinent to hypotheses on habitat exploitation and on  ecological
              aspects of breeding and foraging and habitat  selection. A major goal of the
              project is the completion of  a monograph on emperor penguins at Cape
              Washington, Coulman  Island and Cape Roger. This project will produce synthetic
               work which will provide new insights into the role of  emperor penguins in the
              Antarctic ecosystem.
