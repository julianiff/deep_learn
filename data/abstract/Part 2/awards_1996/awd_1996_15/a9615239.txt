Abstract    :
              9615239  Biscaye  This award is for one year of support to continue work on 
              samples of atmospheric dusts from ice cores from Siple Dome,  West Antarctica. 
              The dusts will be extracted from the ice  and analyzed for mineralogical and
              isotopic (strontium,  neodymium, lead) compositions with a view to determining 
              their provenance---the continental area(s) from which they  were derived and
              transported through the atmosphere to Siple  Dome.  The principal means of
              relating the dusts to their  continental source area(s) will be to compare
              their  mineralogical and isotopic characteristics to the fine  grained
              particles from samples of loess and other aeolian  sediments from Southern
              Hemisphere continental areas.  Information on the source areas of the dusts at
              various  times in the past provides constraints on models of  paleoatmospheric
              circulation and transport around and to  Antarctica.
