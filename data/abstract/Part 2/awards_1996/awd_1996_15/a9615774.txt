Abstract    :
                    Abstract  EEC-9615774  Muller    This award provides funding for a
              three-year collaborative project with University of California, Davis is funded
              to study the development of an integrated, raster-scanning optical microdisplay
              - the project will study flexing and sliding hinges, accurate hinge and mirror
              systems, electrostatic actuators and standard as large-aspect-ratio structures,
              high available-force actuators based on chosen principle, reduced
              -specification scanning display, packaging, integration and testing.    The
              award is significantly cost-shared by Dr. Deborah Crawford, Program Director,
              Communications and Computational Systems program.
