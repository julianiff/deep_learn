Abstract    :
                      The most critical outcome from this workshop will be the start of a 
              wholly new formulation of an interdisciplinary agenda for research at  the
              intersection of communications and building engineering  technologies.  The
              workshop and its report will identify near, medium,  and long term research
              opportunities at the intersection of these two  disciplines.  Furthermore, this
              applications arena, though somewhat  specific in its choice of technologies,
              scale, and where applications  are apt to be deployed, yields a problem rich
              testbed for more general  information infrastructure concepts and technologies.
               Ideally,  effective research in this area would generate a new set of design 
              principles and requirements for future buildings, thus change in the  practice
              of how buildings are designed and constructed to include from  their initial
              conception the communication and emerging work needs of  future workers.
