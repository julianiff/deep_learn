Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a three year study to make  precise and accurate
              measurements of the elevation of the  Antarctic ice sheet in order to detect
              on-going changes in  the surface of the ice sheet.  The location and pattern of
               change discovered may be used to deduce the causes of the  changes.  Suitable
              equipment for these measurements are part  of the Support Office for
              Aerogeophysical Research in  Antarctica (SOAR) facility.  This project will
              evaluate the  quality and calibrate the measurements to be made by SOAR.  Test
              will be made both while the aircraft is parked and  during flights over
              ground-surveyed sites near the aircraft  base camp.  After the validation and
              calibration is  complete, a limited measurement program to detect time  changes
              in surface elevation of glaciologically interesting  sites will be started.  At
              the conclusion of the program the  capability of the SOAR facility to
              accurately and precisely  determine surface elevation will be established. 
              SOAR will  then be useful to all investigators who are interested in  precision
              mapping and detection of change in the Antarctic  ice sheet.
