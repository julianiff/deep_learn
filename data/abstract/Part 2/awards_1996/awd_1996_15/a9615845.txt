                ABSTRACT    OPP-9615845  OBERBAUER, STEPHEN  FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY 
                This project is an extension of a previous research program to investigate
              the effects of potential global warming on Arctic tundra. This project is one
              component of a larger US. effort to contribute to the International Tundra
              Experiment that is examining the possible impact of global climate change on
              tundra growth. The results of this research will contribute to a coordinated
              international effort to determine if a warming climate will result in an
              increase in carbon dioxide flux from the tundra into the atmosphere. The
              contribution of this particular project to the international program is to look
              at the effect of climate warming on the length of the growing season. A longer
              growing season could result from a  warmer climate and a concomitant increase
              in carbon uptake in the tundra root system. These results are critical to
              consider along with other experimental results on climate impacts on the tundra
              so that researchers may be able assess all of the factors that could lead to
              fundamental changes in the tundra ecosystem as a result of global change.
