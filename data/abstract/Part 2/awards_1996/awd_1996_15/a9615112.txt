Abstract    :
              With this renewal award in the Environmentally Benign Chemical Synthesis   and
              Processing Program, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the   research
              of Dr. Tomas Hudlicky of the Department of Chemistry at the   University of
              Florida.   Professor Hudlicky will focus his work on   developing effective
              methods of preparation of pure synthetic   intermediates (synthons) from
              halogenated aromatic waste products and the   use of the synthons in the
              concise synthesis of value-added compounds.   The focus of this research will
              be the biooxidation of highly substituted   aromatic substrates with arene
              dioxygenases expressed in recombinant   bacterial strains and the development
              of electrochemical methods for the   further oxidation of arene-cis-diol
              metabolites to the corresponding   diol-epoxides, tetrols and diol-aziridines. 
              The new metabolites and   synthons will find application in synthetic
              approaches to Amaryllidaceae   and morphine alkaloids, glycocongugates and
              unnatural isomers of inositol   derivatives.
