Abstract    :
                  Hatzes, Artie  AST 96-15571    Dr. Hatzes will continue his research program
              of Doppler imaging to study surface structure on a   variety of active,
              late-type stars.  His program combines continued monitoring of RS CVn stars  
              with new programs to obtain Doppler images of weak T Tauri stars, zero-age main
              sequence stars   in nearby clusters, and cataclysmic variables.  Studies of the
              sizes, shapes, latitudes of formation,   migratory patterns, and overall
              temporal evolution of large cool spots on stars trace the emergent   magnetic
              flux, and so provide fundamental information on the magnetic and convective  
              processes responsible for observed activity on these stars and the Sun.  Dr.
              Hatzes will use the   Hobby-Eberly telescope in preliminary studies of
              cataclysmic variables, while performing studies   of Weak T Tauri stars and
              brighter ZAMS objects with the McDonald telescopes.  In addition,   he will
              begin a new observational program of Zeeman Doppler imaging to study RS CVn  
              and T Tauri stars with the 2.7m McDonald telescope.  In all these programs, the
              goal is to follow   and map star spot morphology and activity as a probe of
              surface magnetic activity and the   underlying stellar dynamo.  ***
