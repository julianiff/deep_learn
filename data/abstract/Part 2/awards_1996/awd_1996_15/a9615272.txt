Abstract    :
              The main objective of this project is to improve the scalability and
              effectiveness of knowledge discovery and data mining systems in order to handle
              large, structural databases (i.e., databases composed of parts and relations
              among parts).  First, a state-of-the-art structural discovery system called
              Subdue will be integrated with one or more existing non-structural discovery
              systems.  Parallel and distributed versions of both Subdue and the integrated
              discovery system will then be developed.  Distributing both the data and the
              processing across several machines will afford the most scalability for the
              discovery systems, and distribution is essential for handling large databases.
              The integrated discovery system will then be applied to several large
              scientific databases.  The results will be evaluated by domain experts and
              disseminated along with source code releases of all software to the scientific
              community.  This research addresses a critical need to improve the scalability
              of existing knowledge discovery and data mining methods, especially in domains
              with richer data representations, will provide scalable discovery systems to
              the scientific community, and will increase the state of knowledge in the
              design of parallel and distributed intelligent systems.
