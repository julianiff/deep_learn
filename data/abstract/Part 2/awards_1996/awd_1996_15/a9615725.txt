Abstract    :
              Bittman  9615725      The pineal gland has long been known to be integral to the
               regulation of seasonal reproduction and its principal hormone,  melatonin, is
              an important transducer of circadian information in  the neuroendocrine axis. 
              This system provides daylength  information to the reproductive axis and allows
              photoperiod to  adjust the secretion of pituitary hormones to seasonally 
              appropriate levels.  The receptors for melatonin are concentrated  in several
              brain sites but the highest concentration resides in the  pars tuberalis. 
              However, the functions of melatonin in this region  are unknown.  In this SGER,
              Dr. Bittman is using sophisticated  molecular biological techniques to identify
              novel genetic targets  of melatonin action in this tissue, and the brain, in
              general to  uncover previously undescribed fundamental mechanisms by which the 
              environment regulates reproduction.  These investigations will lead  to
              significant new insights into the regulation of fertility which  may improve
              our ability to foster the reproduction of endangered  species in the wild and
              in protected environments.
