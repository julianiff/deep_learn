Abstract    :
              This research explores factors that influenced the death toll from the 1918
              influenza epidemic in several Aboriginal communities in the central Canadian
              Subarctic.  The project uses the methods of mathematical epidemiology to
              explore how human mobility carries diseases from place to place, and also how
              mobility and other factors influence mortality within a community, once the
              disease has arrived.  Specific questions include the effects of seasonal and
              between-community differences in aspects of social life, such as travel
              patterns, population size and density, responses to the epidemic (e.g.,
              quarantine), and winter-time settlement structure in conjunction with
              fur-trapping activities.  The project builds on previous work of the
              co-investigators on the 1918 influenza epidemic and other infectious disease
              epidemics in the Americas (Herring) and on modeling the geographic spread of
              infectious diseases (Sattenspiel).  It combines strengths in both quantitative
              methodology and theory and data-oriented ethnohistorical analysis and will lead
              to new epidemiological models that incorporate more realistic structures within
              which humans interact.  These models can be adapted for studying other diseases
              in other communities. The project will enable assessment of the use of
              mathematical modeling methods to complement traditional demographic,
              ethnohistorical, and epidemiological analyses of historic and contemporary
              populations.
