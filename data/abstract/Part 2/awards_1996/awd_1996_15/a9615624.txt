Abstract    :
              This outreach project will bring space weather to a public museum.  Proposed
              mini-exhibits (not to be confused with the large traveling exhibit, Electric
              Space) will focus on what space weather is and how it affects humans and
              technology.  Newly designed interactives in the exhibits will connect the cause
              of space currents to change and the affects on power grids and communications. 
              Updated information will come from a variety of ground-based and space-based
              platforms which visitors can access through a kiosk system.  Combining hands-on
              activities and near-real-time information makes these proposed exhibits
              uniquely important to space weather outreach.
