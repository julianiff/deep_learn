Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a two year program of ice sheet  modeling to
              contribute to the site selection for deep drilling at  the inland site for the
              West Antarctic ice cores (WAISCORES)  program.  Ice flow calculations will be
              performed to provide time-  scale and layer thickness estimates, and to
              identify source  regions of deep ice.  The research will focus on finding sites
               where the climate record should be best preserved throughout its  long ice
              dynamics history.  Using existing radar data and ice  dynamical models sites
              will be identified that optimize age  resolution and avoid potentially
              disturbed basal ice.  The work  will be closely coordinated with the ice coring
              community and  other investigators who are trying to identify areas with good 
              depositional environments and firn preservation.  The project is  a
              collaboration between the University of Texas Institute for  Geophysics and the
              University of Washington Geophysics program.
