Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9615903    This is a comprehensive analytical and experimental
              study of microscale heat transfer in porous silicon.  Analytical work
              incorporates size, structure, and surface-area effects into a general
              microscale heat-transfer framework to predict thermal conductivity, optical
              properties, and radiative transfer.  Established experimental techniques are
              used to examine these effects and to determine key model parameters.  Simple
              engineering models for energy absorption and transport in porous silicon are
              developed for use in design of porous-silicon-based optoelectronic devices.   
              There is no extant analytical framework for predicting the combined effect of
              crystallite size and structural randomness on energy absorption and transport
              in nanometric-scale random structures.  Porous silicon, which has such a
              structure, can emit visible light in response to optical or electrical
              stimulation at room temperature offering a prospect of  large-scale integration
              of optics and electronics.  Knowledge of  the thermophysical properties and
              energy transport mechanisms is critical for design of porous-silica-based
              devices like optical switches and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), as well as for
              the laser processing of these devices.
