Abstract    :
              MagnetoEncephaloGraphy (MEG) is concerned with mapping electrical activity in
              the  brain by measuring the induced external magnetic field.  This mapping is
              applied  for diagnosis of diseases such as epilepsy.  MEG has been a very
              active area  lately due to the steady improvement of weak magnetic field
              measurements and its  relative robustness to inhomogeneities in electrical
              conductivity within the  skull.    This research is developing several
              performance measures and optimization schemes  for magnetoencephalography (MEG)
              and electroencephalography (EEG) systems, from  a signal processing point of
              view.  The measures include: (1) accuracy of source  parameter estimates, (2)
              detectability of a source, based on the probability of  detection, and (3)
              resolution of sources, or the probability of detecting more  than one source.
              These measures are being applied to develop techniques for the  optimum design
              of MEG/EEG system parameters, including sensor placement, type and 
              orientation.
