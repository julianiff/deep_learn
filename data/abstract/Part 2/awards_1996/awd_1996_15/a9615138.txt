Abstract    :
                Abstract  9615138  LaBelle  The Earth's aurora emits a rich variety of radio
              waves over a wide range of frequencies.  These wave are a result of the
              interaction of the electron beams from the magnetosphere interacting with the
              ionospheric plasma.  This project operates an array of low, medium and high
              frequency (LF/MF/HF) radio receivers in Antarctica to study this radio noise
              and to use it to elucidate the physics of the aurora.  The receivers are
              located at South Pole and in the Automatic Geophysical Observatories (AGOs)
              operated by the USARP and BAS (British Antarctic Survey), thus providing
              coverage at a wide range of geomagnetic latitudes.  ***
