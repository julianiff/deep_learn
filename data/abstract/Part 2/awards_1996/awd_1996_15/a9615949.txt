Abstract    :
                      This project is designed to understand the important connections that
              occur among different parts of the aquatic ecosystem including those from
              uplands to the riparian zone, from the riparian zone to surface waters, from
              streams to lakes, and from lakes to their outlets.  Twelve scientists from
              seven institutions have collaborated for 20 years on this research; this
              project will continue long-term studies and experiments on the arctic aquatic
              environment.  Some of these long-term experiments will be continued and
              combined with surveys, detailed process studies, and modeling to answer major
              questions about the linkages among ecosystems.  The products of the research
              will be incorporated into several models including a hydrology-plant-soil
              model, a stream nitrogen model, a lake process model, and a fish energetics
              model.  Through these models the present synthetic view of these aquatic
              ecosystems will be formalized; modeling will also aid in identification of
              research gaps and prediction of effects of perturbations.  This research is
              especially relevant for the fundamental understanding of all aquatic systems
              because the systems studied are among the last pristine aquatic systems, they
              have relatively simple food webs that are amenable to experimentation, and they
              exist in extreme environments that require special adaptations by the organisms
              that inhabit them.
