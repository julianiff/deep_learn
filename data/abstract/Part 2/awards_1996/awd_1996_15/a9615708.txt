Abstract    :
              GOTELLI  DEB-9615708    Antlion larvae build and maintain steep-sided pits which
              are used to trap small arthropods.  The probability of the antlion reaching
              adulthood depends on its ability to locate a suitable site for its pit and to
              determine when to change sites while avoiding predation. This proposal attempts
              to unravel the behavioral rules that antlions use in deciding whether or not to
              stay in a particular pit.  The investigators will combine computer models
              (individual-based simulation models and dynamic programming models) with field
              data and field and laboratory experiments to evaluate a wide variety of
              potential behavioral strategies and assess their success under a range of
              ecological conditions.     This work will significantly expand the current
              understanding of the ecological impact of predators, such as antlions, that
              sieve prey from the environment.  Ant lions are significant predators on local
              ant communities, and they exert a potentially significant effect on the
              populations of these economically important organisms.  The investigators field
              experiments will provide data that will enable a quantifying of the potential
              seasonal impact of antlion predation on local ant populations.  This research
              will provide  information on a general class of sit-and-wait predators which
              are important insect predators.
