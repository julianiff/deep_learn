Abstract    :
              9615938  Wood  The goal of this proposed research is to investigate  the use of
              the Hok killer peptide as a completely new  antibiotic and antiviral system. 
              The potential  efficacy of the Hok peptide as a broad, non-specific, 
              antiparasitic drug will be determined by testing its  activity against relevant
              bacteria, fungi, and phage.   This research highly novel and exploratory since
              the  extracellular antibiotic application of Hok peptide is  largely untested. 
              However, the antibiotic idea is  sound since almost all bacteria tested to date
              are  susceptible to killing by Hok when it is expressed  intracellularly, and
              the PI has recently shown that  phage T4 (a virus that destroys bacteria) can
              be  excluded when the Hok protein is expressed in E. coli  cells.  In order to
              investigate the broad range  effectiveness against human pathogens, the Hok
              peptide  will be overexpressed using recombinant bacteria,  purified using gel
              filtration and reverse-phase, high-  performance-liquid chromatography, and
              identified  through fast-atom-bombardment mass spectroscopy.  Using  the
              purified peptide, antimicrobial assays will be  performed to determine if the
              peptide is capable of  slowing or preventing bacterial and fungal growth.  To 
              thwart the propagation of virus in animal cells in a  manner analogous to how
              the Hok protein excludes T4  phage by killing the host before the virus can 
              propagate, a general suicide system for animal cells  will be developed to
              combat virus-based diseases.  This  will require controllable expression of a
              killer  protein nd activity in a wide variety of animal cells.   Initially, the
              ability of Hok to kill insect cells (as  representative animal cells) will be
              evaluated by using  the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 for Hok  expression
              in insect cells under the polyhedrin  promoter.  ***
