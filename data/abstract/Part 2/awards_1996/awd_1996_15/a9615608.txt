Abstract    :
              AST-9615608  Michael A'Hearn    Drs. A'Hearn and Lisse at the University of
              Maryland will  carry  out a very comprehensive multi-wavelength program of 
              observation  of comet Hale-Bopp.  The primary goal is to gain a better 
              understanding of the cometary formation environments.  In  particular, an
              investigation of the sulfur chemistry in the  comet  has the goal of
              understanding the relevance of sulfur in  terms of  the primordial nature of
              cometary materials.  This award is  supported jointly by the Division of
              Astronomical Sciences  and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the 
              Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences at NSF.
