              ABSTRACT    OPP-9615312  SMETHIE, WILLIAM  LAMONT-DOHERTY EARTH OBSERVATORY 
              COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY    The PI proposes to measure the chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)
              content of water samples taken in the Arctic Ocean on a German research ship in
              1995. The analyses will be used to determine the amount of time that has passed
              since the water at different water depths was at the ocean surface in
              continental shelf regions. This technique not only reveals the time that it
              takes for water to sink and spread through the Arctic Ocean but also reveals
              pathways for currents in which the CFCs are carried. The results of this study
              will yield definitive information on water-mass exchanges in the Arctic Ocean
              that are responsible for dissemination of pollutants and provide evidence of
              current patterns that may have changed in response to global climate change
              since the current patterns were previously determined. There is increasing
              evidence that current patterns have changed in the past decade and this study
              will add important new information to those preliminary results.
