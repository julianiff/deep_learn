Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program supports research on carbon dioxide by Dr. Donald J. Darensbourg   of
              the Chemistry Department, Texas A&M University.  The main focus of the  
              research is on the fundamental processes occurring during   copolymerization of
              carbon dioxide and epoxides to form polycarbonates.    Information gleaned will
              be used to design more selective catalysts for   those reactions.  Tungsten,
              zinc, cadmium, and copper complexes will be   used to probe the lability of
              alkoxide complexes, epoxide complexation   and subseqent coupling with ligated
              carboxylates, and catalyst activity   and selectivity.   In addition, metal
              catalyzed copolymerization   reactions of carbon dioxide and aziridines to form
              polyurethane will be   explored, and reactivity of carbon dioxide with
              coordinatively and   electronically unsaturated metal carbonyl derivatives that
              contain   pi-donor ligands will be investigated.  Biphasic catalysis and  
              supercritical carbon dioxide will be used for catalyst separation from   the
              substrate and the product in these homogeneous processes.    Carbon dioxide is
              a potential source of carbon for various uses.  Also,   it can serve as an
              environmentally-benign replacement solvent for   volatile organic compounds. 
              In this study, catalysts will be designed   for reactions in which carbon
              dioxide is used as a source material for   synthesis of useful polymers.  In
              addition, supercritical carbon dioxide   will be tested as a solvent for some
              of the separations needed in the   process.
