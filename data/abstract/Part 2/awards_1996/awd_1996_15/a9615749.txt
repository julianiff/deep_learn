Abstract    :
              This study is designed to test the hypothesis that the basal metabolic rate of
              Mongolian pastoral nomads is accurately predicted by the equations developed by
              the World Health Organization (WHO) for use throughout the world. The basal
              metabolic rate is the minimum energy required to maintain life, and is a major
              proportion of total human energy needs.  According to the WHO, the prediction
              equations are applicable regardless of the climate in which the population
              lives and regardless of seasonal variation in temperature stress.  However,
              there is considerable evidence that the basal metabolic rate of indigenous
              populations varies inversely with temperature.  Mongolia provides a natural
              laboratory for testing this ongoing scientific debate.  This study will measure
              basal metabolic rate, diet, and cold exposure in male and female Mongolian
              pastoral nomads 18 years of age and older who live in a cold, high latitude
              climate with seasonally extreme cold stress.   It  will add to the knowledge of
              factors influencing basal metabolic rate in human populations and to the
              ongoing scientific discussion as to whether basal metabolic rate is a universal
              trait in humans influenced only by age, sex, and body weight, or whether it
              adapts to environmental factors such as cold stress.
