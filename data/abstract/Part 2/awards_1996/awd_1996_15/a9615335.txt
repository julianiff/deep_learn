Abstract    :
              9615335   RIESEBERG   One of the most exciting recent advances in biology has
              been the ability to generate detailed genetic maps for almost any plant or
              animal species. These maps not only are essential for isolating genes of
              interest, but they also can be used to study important questions in population
              biology such as how new species are formed.  However, mapping data sets are
              very large and complex, and the current theoretical and analytical tools for
              exploring them are inadequate.  The purpose of this grant is to develop and
              apply a new theoretical approach called the "method of junctions" to the
              analysis and interpretation of these complex data sets.  Specifically, this
              method will be applied to mapping data sets derived from hybrids between wild
              sunflower species of the genus Helianthus.  Problems that will be addressed
              include determining exactly what genetic changes are necessary for new species
              to be formed and estimating how rapidly this process might take place.  
              Although this proposal will rely on mapping data sets generated for wild
              sunflower species, the analytical methods developed here should be broadly
              applicable to any data set that involves genetic mapping data.  Some
              theoretical and practical issues that these methods may affect range from
              understanding how genes interact with other genes to determining the most  
              effective strategies for moving genes of agronomic importance from wild plants
              into related cultivated species.
