Abstract    :
              Impact of Engineering Programs on K-12 Teacher Preparation    A group of three
              students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute will spend fourteen weeks (seven
              weeks at WPI and seven weeks at NSF) working on an interactive qualifying
              project as part of the requirements for their programs at WPI.  The students
              will study a number of NSF engineering projects which have a significant K-12
              teacher preparation focus.  They will determine the impact of these projects on
              the teacher preparation community and will investigate effective ways in which
              these types of engineering/teacher education collaborations can be promoted and
              implemented.  They will present their findings at the American Society for
              Engineering Education's national conference.
