Abstract    :
              Irving Epstein and Anatol Zhabotinsky of Brandeis University are funded   by a
              grant from the Theory and Computational  Chemistry Program of the   National
              Science Foundation to continue experimental and theoretical   research in
              oscillating reactions and in general nonlinear chemical   dynamics. Mechanistic
              investigations will be conducted to determine the   role of the elementary
              steps  in oscillating reactions, which could lead   to the development of new 
              chemical oscillators. These studies employ   both experimental and
              computational methods. New chemical oscillators   will be developed such as
              those involving Nitrogen oxides. Mechanistic   studies on systems such as those
              involving chlorites and magnetic fields   will be done. Waves and patterns such
              as the Turing patterns will be   studied. Chaotic dynamical coupled systems
              will be investigated.  The chaotic dynamically coupled systems are relevant to
              such things as   combustion of fossil fluids and the formation of smog, as well
              as the   action of neurotransmitters.  The treatment of drinking water through 
               chlorites are also a part of this research. The effect of electromagnetic  
              waves on living organisms will be studied.
