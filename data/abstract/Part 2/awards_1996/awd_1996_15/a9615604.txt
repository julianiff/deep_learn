Abstract    :
              AST-9615604  Daniel Boice    An intensive international observing campaign is
              focussing on  comet Hale-Bopp as it reaches perihelion in April, 1997.  Using 
              existing observations and those anticipated from the campaign,  this research
              team will construct a global model of Hale-Bopp  using an existing suite of
              computer codes.  The goal is to use  this global model to make predictions of
              the comet's behavior to  aid in the collection of additional data and to help
              understand  its physico-chemical nature, in particular the mixing ratios of 
              volatiles relative to water to ascertain the icy composition of  the nucleus.

              and Physical  Sciences at NSF.  ========================================
