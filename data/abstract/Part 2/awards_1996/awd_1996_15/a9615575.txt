Abstract    :
                      9615575  Suh  This award is to partially support a Mechanical
              Engineering  Curriculum Workshop.  This workshop will evaluate and consider 
              future directions on how to retain the core disciplines while  letting other
              educational aspects evolve.  Since the mechanical  industry is not primarily
              driven by technology, the mechanical  engineering education curriculum must
              reflect this.  The results  of the workshop will be a widely disseminated
              document so that  others can benefit from the evaluation that will take place.
