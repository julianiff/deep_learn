Abstract    :
              9615768  Brigham-Grette    This SGER award supports a pilot study of Elgygytgyn
              Lake, a large  lacustrine basin located 100km north of the Arctic Circle in 
              northeast Russia.  This lake was created by a meteorite impact that  generated
              a crater roughly 23km in diameter.  The lack of  glaciation in this basin makes
              it highly likely that the modern  lake contains a continuous paleoenvironmental
              record of at least  the last 250,000 years, but probably back to the time of
              impact.   It is believed that an international, multidisciplinary project to 
              collect and analyze core materials from this lake will provide a  paleoclimate
              record unparalleled in northern Asia.  The objectives  in this project are
              intended to test the hypothesis that this  large, but morphologically simple
              lacustrine system contains a high  resolution sediment archive extending
              through the Holocene and well  into the late Pleistocene.  If successful, these
              cores will provide  the impetus for a major deep drilling program to retrieve
              the  entire record in the future.
