Abstract    :
                AST-9615625  Scherb    Drs. Frank Scherb and Fred Roesler at the University of
               Wisconsin will carry out a comprehensive program of  observations on comet
              Hale-Bopp.  Hale-Bopp is viewed as a  target of  opportunity to focus an array
              of observational and analysis  efforts on  understanding the composition and
              structure of comets.  These investigators will use newly augmented facilities
              and  instruments at the WIYN telescope on Kitt Peak, Arizona and  at the Pine
              Bluff Observatory near Madison, Wisconsin.  This  award is  supported jointly
              by the Division of Astronomical Sciences  and the Office of  Multidisciplinary
              Activities in the  Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences at NSF.
