Abstract    :
                Photocatalytic oxidation of organic molecules at the surface of  titania shows
              promise as a method for the remediation of organic  contaminated groundwater,
              and the destruction of organic  contaminants.  This project by Professor Engel
              and his students at  the University of Washington, supported in the Analytical
              and  Surface Chemistry Program, addresses the detailed mechanism of this 
              photocatalytic oxidation reaction.  Ultra high vacuum molecular  beam
              scattering methods, coupled with scanning probe microscopy for  structural
              characterization of the titania surface, provide  detailed mechanistic and
              dynamic information about several model  reactions.  In particular, acetone,
              formic acid and propanol are  used as model organic species, and a range of
              photolysis conditions  and surface conditions are investigated.    The
              photocatalytic detoxification of organic contaminated  groundwater is an
              important environmental remediation goal.  The  work of this project is
              designed to provide the basic understanding  of this photocatalysis on
              promising substrates such as titanium  dioxide.  Structural and kinetic
              information is combined to supply  a complete picture of the photocatalytic
              mechanism.  This  information will be useful in optimizing both the catalytic
              surface  and the conditions for environmental remediation processes.*
