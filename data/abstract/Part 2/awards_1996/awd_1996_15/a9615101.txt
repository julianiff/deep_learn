Gaisser  The South Pole Air Shower Experiment
              (SPASE) consists of a sparsely filled array of scintillation detectors covering
              several thousand square meters at South Pole.  It detects energetic charged
              particles (mostly electrons) which are produced in the upper atmosphere by
              cosmic rays.  The experiment has several goals, the most important of which is
              to determine the elemental composition of the primary cosmic rays at energies
              above approximately 100 TeV.  In order to do this SPASE works in coincidence
              with the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA), which has several
              hundred optical detectors so deep in the ice sheet that the only products of
              the cosmic ray interactions which can be seen by AMANDA are muons.  The ratio
              of muons to electrons produced in a cosmic ray shower is a sensitive function
              of the mass of the original primary cosmic ray.  Since SPASE can measure the
              number of electrons produced by a cosmic ray as well as its total energy, and
              AMANDA can determine the number of muons, the mass of an incident primary
              cosmic ray can be determined.  The determination of the elemental composition
              of cosmic rays is one of the most important outstanding questions in cosmic ray
              physics and such information will shed light on the origin of energetic cosmic
              rays.  This project is cooperative with the University of Leeds in the United
              Kingdom.  ***
