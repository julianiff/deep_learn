Abstract    :
               This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              UCLA.  The student will investigate how unequal access to coastal natural
              resources affects the household management of shrimp aquaculture in China.  The
              hypothesis is that resource-rich households will develop entrepreneurial
              management styles and practice intensive production, while resource-poor
              households will follow a risk-averse, diversified and diffused style of
              management and economic production.  Households practicing intensive shrimp
              aquaculture differ from those using more sustainable traditional methods in
              terms of labor allocation, decision making, financial management and household
              culture.  Methods include structured interviews, formal studies of decision
              making, time allocation studies as well as participant observation.     This
              research is important because the growth of shrimp aquaculture is part of
              economic development in many poorer nations of the world, and has been
              associated with harm to the local ecosystem.  The advance in our knowledge of
              how these economic systems work in micro-level detail of household decision
              making, will be helpful to planners trying to maintain the developmental
              benefits while ameliorating the ecological costs.
