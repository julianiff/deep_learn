Abstract    :
                 Abstract      A fundamental unanswered question in developmental neuroscience
              is  how precise connections are made between   nerves and their appropriate
              target muscles in embryos.  This study uses  a defined model system consisiting
              of nerve  cell and muscle cell cultures from embryos of the frog Xenopus to
              address this  issue.  The studies are based on observations that repetitive
              electrical stimulation of  a particular nerve cell induced a persistent 
              depression in the activity of  a  another  (heterosynaptic) nerve cell.   This
              activity-dependent  long-term modulation of the  connection  could be an
              important mechanism  in establishing the functional nerve-muscle connections of
              the animal.   Structural   and physiological changes in the neuromuscular 
              junctions are analysed using a variety of techniques, including  the use of
              vital fluoresent dyes that can be injected into specific nerve cell and thus
              label them  for subsequent identification.
