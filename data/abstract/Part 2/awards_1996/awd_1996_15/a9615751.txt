Abstract    :
              9615751  Romanowicz    This grant provides $65,000 as one-half support of the
              costs of  acquiring new and upgraded computer equipment for the Geophysics 
              computer laboratory at UC Berkeley, a facility shared by the  Berkeley
              Seismographic Station (BSS).  Specifically, the  equipment and upgrades will
              include a dual CPU SUN Enterprise  3000 server, eight Sun Ultra 1 140 upgrades
              to eight existing SUN  SLC's, one new SUN Ultra 1 140 workstation and one SUN
              Ultra 1  200E workstation. The addition of a new faculty member, Dr. Doug 
              Drever, and the computationally intensive needs of other  seismologists and
              geophysicists at Berkeley will benefit from the  new capabilities afforded by
              this equipment which will include  using software to create a parallel virtual
              machine (PVM) from  multiple upgraded workstations. Specific projects that will
               utilize this equipment include modeling of regional crustal and  upper mantle
              structure in the western U. S. through inversion of  broadband waveform data
              collected from multiple digital  seismographic networks including both
              permanent BSS and IRIS GSN  stations and data from portable IRIS-PASSCAL
              instruments, studies  of the nucleation and growth of earthquake ruptures and 
              statistical analyses of the relationships between large  aftershocks and
              mainshock fault slip, global mantle tomography  based on models of the
              anelastic attenuation of seismic waves,  numerical modeling of geodynamic
              processes and ab intio  calculations of the properties of mantle minerals.  ***
