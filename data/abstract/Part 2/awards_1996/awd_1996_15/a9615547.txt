Abstract    :
              9615547  Burr    The NSF funds provided to this project of the Southern Illinois
              University's fluid collection of vertebrate animal specimens will be used to
              hire a Collection Manager for two years (after which time the position will be
              made permanent by the University), to move the collection into 3500 square feet
              ($518,000 value that incorporates environmental controls and room for growth)
              of new space recently constructed by the University (which, in addition to the
              new space, has provided $31,000 in shelving, computers and other equipment),
              and purchase basic curatorial supplies to improve and expand the relocated and
              centralized SIUC fluid collection of vertebrate animals.  The SIUC collection
              has been heavily used as a regional resource, and contains unique and valuable
              materials used in systematic and ecological research and training, and in
              environmental analysis and monitoring of changes in biodiversity.  The funding
              for the overall project, clearly, is an excellent example of partnership
              between the Southern Illinois University and the NSF.                      THIS
