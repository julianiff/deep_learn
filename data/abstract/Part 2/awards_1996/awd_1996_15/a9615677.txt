Abstract    :
              9615677  Ekstrom    This grant provides $149,829 as partial salary support for a
               technician responsible for network administration for the  seismology computer
              facility at Harvard University.  This is a  Phase II technician support
              proposal under the EAR/IF technician  support sub-program and as such, will
              continue support of this  technician for an additional two-years beyond the
              first three  years of technical support (EAR-9219192). The seismology group at 
              Harvard conducts world-class research on global tomographic  models, studies of
              Love and Rayleigh wave propagation in the  crust and upper mantle and continues
              service to the seismological  community via their efforts at calculating
              waveforms, travel  times, complete seismograms etc. from data generated from
              the  IRIS Global Seismographic Network (GSN).   This grant will  provide
              technical service to a large group (20 faculty, graduate  and undergraduate
              students) of seismologists.  Additionally, the  University, under the
              guidelines for a Phase II technician  support proposal under the EAR/IF program
              is committed to support  of this position for a minimum of two-years beyond
              expiration of  this Phase II award,  ***
