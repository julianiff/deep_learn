Abstract    :
              Abstract  9615855  Inan  This project operates very low frequency (VLF) radio
              receivers at Palmer Station, Antarctica for the purpose of studying ionospheric
              disturbance caused by global lightning. The principal mode of operation is to
              measure changes in amplitude and phase of signals received from several distant
              VLF transmitters.  These changes occur in the VLF signals following lightening
              strokes because radio (whistler) waves from the lightening can cause the
              precipitation into the upper atmosphere of very energetic electrons from the
              Van Allan radiation belts, which then cause increased ionization in the
              ionosphere, thus affecting the propagating VLF radio waves.  Because the
              directions to the VLF transmitters are known, it is possible to remotely track
              the path of the thunderstorms causing the changes.  The Palmer receivers are
              operating as a collaboration with the British and Brazilian Antarctic Programs,
              both of which operate similar receivers. This project contributes to the Global
              Change initiative.  ***
