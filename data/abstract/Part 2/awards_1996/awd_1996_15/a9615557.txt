Abstract    :
                Living anthropoid or 'higher' primates include monkeys, apes and humans. 
              Diverse lines of evidence from the fields of molecular biology, comparative
              anatomy, and paleontology demonstrate that higher primates are descendants of a
              single common ancestor, and that the higher primate lineage diverged from other
              primates (including the ancestors of living lemurs and tarsiers) very early in
              the Cenozoic Era.  However, the fossil record of the early phases of anthropoid
              evolution is extremely poor. As a result, we do not know precisely when the
              earliest anthropoids lived, where the anthropoid lineage originated, how
              anthropoids fit on the evolutionary tree of primates, nor do we understand
              numerous aspects of their paleobiology.  This project aims to fill this largest
              remaining gap in our knowledge of primate and human evolution by recovering new
              fossil primates from Eocene (55-34 million year old) sites in China.  
              Laboratory studies of these fossils will provide new information on the
              critical evolutionary transition from primitive, prosimian-like primates to
              more advanced anthropoids.  Several new taxa of early anthropoids will be
              described, and functional analyses of their teeth and skeletons will reveal a
              great deal about their paleobiology, including their dietary preferences and
              mode of locomotion.
