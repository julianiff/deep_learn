Abstract    :
              Philip Coppens of the State University of New York at Buffalo has support   from
              the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his studies   of the
              electronic structure of solids using X-ray crystallography.  His   research
              focuses on the following objectives:  a) to determine the charge   density
              distribution in solids; b) to exploit the tunability of   synchrotron sources
              for resonant scattering, which will allow   differentiation between atoms of
              the same element in different oxidation   states; c) to study excited states of
              molecules in crystals; and d) to   analyze multi-sublattice composite solids. 
              Very low-temperature single   crystal techniques will be exploited for data
              collection.    These experiments will help provide the tools necessary to study
              the   structures of short-lived excited states in a number of photochemically  
              active systems.  The charge-separated systems are important because they   are
              directly related to energy conversion and storage.  Regarding other   aspects
              of these studies, good comparisons of charge densities obtained   from
              crystallography and from theory are needed if we are ever going to   figure out
              why solids pack the way they do, and mixed valence compounds   are very
              important in many catalytic systems, technologically important   materials and
              biological systems.
