Abstract    :
              9615313  Whitham  Studies of natural perturbations help understand how plants
              ecologically and/or evolutionarily respond to climate change. Since the
              eruption of the Sunset Crater in about 1300AD, colonizing plants have had only
              a few hundred years to adapt to this hotter, dryer, and nutrient poor cinder
              environment. This LTREB project represents a continuation of a 15 year study on
              how these environmental stresses have affected pinyon pine and its dependent
              community members. Compared to trees growing in low stress sandy-loam soils,
              trees growing in cinders produce less defensive resin, suffer chronic insect
              outbreaks, and suffer corresponding declines in mycorrhizal mutualists, growth
              and cone production. This in turn affects birds and mammals dependent upon
              pinyon seeds for their survival. Associated changes in tree genetics suggest
              that the selection pressures imposed by this new environment have resulted in
              genetic adjustments in the plant population. The distributions of dependent
              mycorrhiza, arthropods, and vertebrates map onto the underlying genetic
              structure of the plant population.    Because the southwest has experienced
              general warming since the beginning of record keeping and is currently
              suffering a 100-year record drought, by contrasting Sunset Crater with adjacent
              less stressed control sites, the PI's can address the question, "Is Sunset
              Crater an analogue to global climate change and if so, how can it be used to
              predict the ecological and evolutionary impacts of continuing warming trends?"
              The continuation of long-term monitoring of individual tress and the associated
              long-term experiments will provide a clear answer to this important question.
