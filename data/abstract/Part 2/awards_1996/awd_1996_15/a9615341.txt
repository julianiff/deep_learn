Abstract    :
              9615341  Nadkarni  Long-term ecological processes in tropical cloud forests and
              their canopy communities are poorly understood relative to many other habitats
              and ecosystem components. The major objective of the proposed research is to
              build upon a unique set of data that has been gathered over the past decade at
              the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve in Costa Rica. Proposed work includes
              testing of two hypotheses concerning the role that canopy components play in
              forest nutrient cycling and dynamics. They will address processes that allow
              live and dead canopy components to serve as nutrient capacitors in this forest
              by efficiently capturing allogenic atmospheric nutrients, retaining them in the
              canopy, and then transferring them to other ecosystem parts. This research will
              also support participation in the ongoing long-term multi-site study of litter
              and stem decomposition. Anticipated results include new information on
              long-term aspects of tropical cloud forest and canopy ecology, synthesis of
              more than a decade of descriptive, experimental, and modeling work at the site,
              and integration with ongoing research, educational, and conservation activities
              in the Monteverde region.
