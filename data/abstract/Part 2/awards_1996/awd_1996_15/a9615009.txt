Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9615009    The proposed project deals with an important problem in
              modeling radiative heat   transfer.  One factor that makes accurate prediction
              of the radiative heat fluxes in combustion systems difficult is the lack of
              accurate spectral properties of radiating gases.  Existing property data for
              gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapor have an average uncertainty as
              large as 70%.  These data were obtained more than 30 years ago.  Since that
              time, the accuracy of detection equipment has improved tremendously.  The PI
              proposes to use an FTIR-spectrometer and an isothermal high-temperature gas
              column to obtain spectral absorption data of radiating gases.
