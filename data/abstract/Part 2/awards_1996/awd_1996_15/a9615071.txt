Abstract    :
              ***  9615071  Perona  The project is an investigation of social reactivity, 
              intention, and relationship in close-coupled interaction of  people and
              computer-based, biologically-motivated agents. It  will result in the creation
              of a virtual social environment  of social agents, with visualization and with
              real-time  human-computer interaction. An agent model, whose parallel  and
              modular structure is based on the architecture of the  primate brain, will be
              implemented to function interactively  and in real-time. An interface to human
              participants will be  implemented consisting of real-time visualization and
              real  time input devices including an advanced, six-degree-of  freedom tracker
              ball. Social agents will react to each other  socially, with their intentions
              observed and their  affiliative relations assessed by the other social agents. 
              Observed behaviors and subjective experiences of human  participants will be
              reported.  Although the fundamentally  social nature of people is well known,
              the effects and  results of this social nature in cooperating with computers 
              and multiple automated agents are little understood.  Affiliation,
              group-belonging, a sense of social solidarity,  and the attribution of
              intention are key in facilitating  cooperation and learning in multi-agent
              activity with human  participants. This project makes important first steps 
              toward understanding, modeling, and providing experimental  infrastructure for
              the study of these phenomena.    ***
