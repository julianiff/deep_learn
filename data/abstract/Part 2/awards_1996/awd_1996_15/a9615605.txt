Abstract    :
              AST-9615605  Harold Weaver      Dr. Harold Weaver will pursue an infrared
              wavelength  investigation of the vaporization behavior of comet Hale-Bopp as 
              its distance from the Sun changes.  He is interested in measuring  molecular
              production rates in order to examine the organic  molecular emissions from the
              comet, with particular emphasis on  methane and carbon monoxide.
