Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    96-15374  O'Brien  Invasion of an exotic Cladoceran into North
              American Reservoirs    Invasions of non-native species can cause profound
              problems by displacing or dominating indigenous species.   One such recent
              invasion is that of Daphnia lumholtzi, a crustacean zooplankter that is
              invading the reservoirs of southeastern and south central North America. 
              During the last five years D. lumholtzi has invaded 124 reservoirs in 21
              states, including 29 reservoirs in Missouri and 5 in Kansas.  Daphnia lumholtzi
              has an unusually large head and tail spines. These features would be expected
              to reduce predation and increase their competitive advantage compared with
              other daphnids lacking similar structures.  The invasion of this species thus
              may dramatically alter freshwater food webs, where daphnids are often keystone
              species.  In this project we will investigate the zoogeographic distribution of
              D. lumholtzi in Kansas and Missouri reservoirs, and will carry out extensive
              parallel limnological measurements.  We will learn (1) what conditions affect
              the likelihood of invasions, and (2) the ecological effects on invaded food
              webs.
