Abstract    :
              This award is for support for two years to develop the technology  and
              methodology for digitizing the photographs and analyzing the  thin sections
              from ice cores.  In addition, the application of  digital technology for
              whole-core stratigraphy, using digital  photography, image enhancement and
              image processing will be  investigated.  The thin section analysis will be
              piloted with  samples already in hand from the Taylor Dome ice core.  If 
              successful, these techniques will be applied to samples from the  Siple Dome
              ice core, in cooperation with Principal Investigators  already funded to
              retrieve and examine these sections.  The  original digital images with all
              original data annotation files  will be distributed to Siple Dome principal
              investigators for  their use in the interpretation of their own data.  All
              software  and hardware acquired for this project will become part of the 
              permanent equipment inventory at the U.S. National Ice Core  Laboratory and
              will be available for use by clients at the  facility.
