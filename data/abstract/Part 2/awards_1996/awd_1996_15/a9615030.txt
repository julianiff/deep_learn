Abstract    :
              Rudolph A. Marcus of the California Institute of Technology  is  funded   by a
              grant from the Theory and Computational  Chemistry Program of the   National
              Science Foundation to continue  theoretical research in electron   transfer in
              large biomolecules and at interfaces. Eight research problems   will be
              addressed: 1) electron transfer and  scanning tunnel  microscopy   (STM) across
              ordered monolayers; 2) nonadiabaticity and electron transfer   in proteins; 3)
              charge transfer rate constants at semiconductor    electrodes; 4) bias
              dependence of STM images of organic monolayers  on   graphite; 5)
              electrochemical inverse photoemission; 6) sequential   approach to electron
              transfer in proteins; 7) intramolecular dynamics and   unimolecular reactions;
              8) mass-independent isotope effect.  This research will address the problem of
              charge transfer in  large   biomolecules and will therefore provide clues for
              the understanding of   the mechanism of such processes as photosynthesis.  It
              will also clarify   the determination of the structure of surfaces, and will
              help  in the   construction of electronic devices, for example. The charge
              transfer   research has also implications for corrosion and batteries.
