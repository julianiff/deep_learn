Abstract    :
                    Abstract  EEC-9615738  Ku    This three year award (the tenth year plus
              two-year phase out) phases out the University of California, San Diego's
              Industry/University Cooperative Research for Ultra-High Speed Circuits.  The
              Center continues to meet the renewal criteria of the I/UCRC Program.    The
              research program of the Center focuses in three areas:  1) Spread spectrum
              communications and adaptive digital and image signal processing; 2) High
              performance and high speed very large system integration algorithm - specific
              integrated circuits design and 3) ultra-high speed integrated circuit device
              and circuit development.    Two women undergraduates are funded to augment the
              Center's research.  They will study; 1) a component of multi-carrier CDMA
              wireless communication systems and 2) applications of DSP to broadband wireless
              communications systems.    Funding for an evaluator to study the
              university/industry interaction occurring in the Center is provided in the
              third year of this award.    Additonal funding is provided in this award to
              augment the Center's ongoing research program and to obtain a membership in the
              Center.
