Abstract    :
                    Abstract  EEC-9615468  White    The 19-minute video "Catalysts for
              Change", describing the operation of the NSF Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Centers Program, was completed, at the University of California,
              Berkeley, in January, 1993.  Although the video still describes the program
              well, some editing of the video is called for since there have been changes in
              the Centers in the program, funding levels, more recent technology transfer
              successes, and so on.  In addition, the impact of the video could be increased
              if some rearrangements were made in the order of presentation of the topics.   
              The University of California, Berkeley proposes to make these changes by the
              Fall of 1996 with the video being more up-to-date, somewhat shorter, and more
              modular video.  The work  will be done by the same people who created the
              original video.    This award provides funding to modify the
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers Program video "Catalysts for
              Change."    The Principal Investigator and his colleagues are experts in their
              fields and have the original master prints to use for the necessary
              modifications.
