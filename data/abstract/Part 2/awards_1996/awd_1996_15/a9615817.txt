Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program is supporting a   Satellite
              Symposium on Density Functional Theory and Applications which   will be held
              from June 3-9, 1997 on the campus of Duke University in   Durham, North
              Carolina.  It is to be followed immediately by the 9th   International Congress
              of Quantum Chemistry in Atlanta, Georgia.  Density   Functional Theory has
              become a major theoretical method for electronic   structure calculations of
              molecules and condensed matter.  The symposium   will bring together
              theoretical and computational chemists, physicists   from around the world who
              are on the frontier of the development of the   basic formalism and
              applications of density functional theory.  It is   anticipated that
              approximately 200 scientists will participate in this   conference including 50
              speakers.  What is particularly significant for   US Science is the large size
              of the symposium and the fact that it is   going to be the first one accessible
              to a relatively large number of US   graduate students and postdoctoral
              fellows.  This symposium is organized   by Prof. W. Yang of Duke University and
              Prof. M. Levy of Tulane.
