              Abstract  ATM-9615952  Jin, Fei-fei  University of Hawaii  Title: Modeling the
              Tropical Climate State and its Interannual  Variability with Coupled
              Ocean-Atmosphere-Land Models    This project is a continuation of NSF supported
              research which  investigates annual and interannual tropical ocean-atmosphere 
              interactions.    The PI intends to study the tropical climate state, its annual
               cycle, and interannual variability as well as their interactions  using a
              conceptual model to outline principal mechanisms.  An  Intermediate Coupled
              Model (ICM) will be used as a main tool for  detailed bifurcation study and
              numerical simulation to understand  the roles of the principal physical
              processes highlighted by the  simple conceptual model and the ICM.    This
              study will advance our understanding of the nature of the  tropical climate
              state and its annual and interannual variability  observed in tropical
              ocean-atmosphere system and simulated by  coupled models.
