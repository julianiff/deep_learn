Abstract    :
              9615524  Padman       The proposed work is an extension of the data set obtained
               as part of an integrated research program ("Anzflux") into the  oceanographic
              structure of upper mixed layer of the eastern  Weddell Sea.  It was carried out
              from the RVIB Nathaniel B.  Palmer in the austral winter of 1994.  This
              component of the  integrated program was an effort to measure high frequency 
              vertical profiles of velocity and temperature using a Rapid  Sampling Vertical
              Profiler, a tethered sensor system developed by  the principal investigator
              that free falls through the upper 250  meters of the ocean.       The overall
              objective of this project is to study the  dynamics of momentum and energy
              fluxes in the upper mixed layer,  and to investigate the processes that
              determine the stability of  the pycnocline.  Particular emphasis is placed on
              the response of  the pycnocline to the mesoscale velocity field, internal
              waves,  and other coherent turbulence features.  The specific goal of  this
              extension is to model the fluxes of heat and buoyancy  associated with
              double-diffusive convection, and the impact of  tidal currents on mixing in the
              upper layers of the Weddell Sea.       These measurements, in conjunction with
              other concurrent  experiments to quantify the energy brought to the underside
              of  the ice, will form the basis of a regional study of the processes 
              responsible for the relatively thick upper mixed layer and thin  ice cover.  It
              is believed that these conditions are only  marginally stable, and are
              maintained by a relatively high upward  heat flux, which, if interrupted, could
              lead to deep vertical  convection, and a significant change in the oceanic
              climate.  ***
