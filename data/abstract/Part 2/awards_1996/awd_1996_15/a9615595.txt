Abstract    :
              9615595  Kaufman    WNET is conducting planning for Wild TV, a new environmental
              education public television series for children ages 8-13.  The planning
              activities consist of post-production and evaluation of a new version of the
              pilot episode of the series.  WNET will reversion the pilot episode to address
              concerns raised by the reviewers to a previous proposal, as well as
              incorporating recommendations from the formative evaluation conducted by RMC
              Research Corporation.   During the planning phase, the producers will work
              closely with Dr. Betty Faber and Mark Testa, two environmental educators with
              expertise in extra-curricular settings.  These educators have been added to the
              advisory committee and Dr. Faber will serve as lead content advisor to the
              project.  After production of the revised pilot is completed, RMC Research
              Corporation will conduct another evaluation to determine the effectiveness of
              the revisions to the project.
