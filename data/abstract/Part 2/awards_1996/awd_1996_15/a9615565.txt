Abstract    :
              9615565  Zhou  This project will investigate the possibility of modeling 
              biological phenomena such as hormone release, neuron  firings, and
              electrophysiological profiles, by viewing  pertinent measurements as events
              with random occurrence  times.  Such time series and their transformations are
              known  as point processes and filtered point processes,  respectively, and
              their application to biological signals  will offer additional insight into
              their mechanisms.  In  collaboration with a neuroscience research group at
              Emory  University, biologically meaningful models will be explored  and
              state-of-the-art statistical signal processing tools  will be adopted to
              extract model parameters.  Directly  interpretable models and advanced signal
              processing  methodologies are capable of explaining certain biological 
              phenomena which may not be evident from the raw data.  A  formal joint proposal
              (with collaborators from life science  fields) will be submitted at the end of
              the twelve-month  planning period.  The present planning proposal will provide 
              support for one graduate student and release time for the PI  both of which are
              instrumental for the success of a junior  faculty entering a new
              interdisciplinary field.  ***
