Abstract    :
              9615141  Scholz    This grant provides $29,524 as partial support of the costs
              of  modernizing the seismic processing facility at RSMAS.  Specifically, the
              bulk of NSF support will pay for one-half of  the cost of acquiring PROMAX 2-D
              seismic processing software.  This grant forms part of a much larger
              modernization plan that is  being financed by the University of Miami and will
              include  support of a system manger, 2 new workstations, cost-sharing for 
              seismic processing software and a major laboratory space  renovation.  These
              renovations and equipment will replace their  current and aging Solbourne
              server running ITA seismic processing  software, presently their primary
              processing system, and their  DEC VAX minicomputer running the DISCO seismic
              processing  software as their backup system.   Enhancement of the 
              computational power available to these Pi's will support  interesting and
              fundamental research projects in reflection  seismology including,
              multi-channel seismic investigations of the  structures within sediments
              deposited in active juvenile rift  basins (i.e Lake Baikal in Russia and the
              East African Rift  Lakes; Lake Victoria, Lake Malawi, and Lake Tanganyika), 
              reflection profiling of the sequence stratigraphy of the Great  Bahama Bank and
              studies of the tectonic evolution of the Cariaco  Basin, Venezuela.  Support of
              this grant has been provided by  both the Division of Earth Sciences and the
              Division of Ocean  Sciences.  ***
