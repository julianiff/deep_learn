Abstract    :
              9615020    Design of drilled foundations for urban infrastructure 
              rehabilitation  requires that a significant reduction be taken in the  strength
              of the  geomaterials into which they are installed, which leads to  relatively
              high  construction costs.  With increasing budgetary constraints  on 
              infrastructure management, there is an immediate need to  develop 
              straightforward and practical means to restore the strength  of geomaterial  to
              reduce the cost of construction.    This research explores a speculative but
              potentially  economically important  method to enhance the capacity and
              predictability of side  shear in drilled  shafts by the use of lime slurry
              conditioning.  In  particular, this project  addresses the conditioning of the
              soil/concrete interface  through a  coordinated study involving both laboratory
              and field tests  in natural  soil.    This study will involve the joint efforts
              of both the  University of Houston  and Bogazici University in Turkey, and is
              supported by  contributions in  kind from both the International Association of
              Foundation  Drilling and the  National Lime Association.  ***
