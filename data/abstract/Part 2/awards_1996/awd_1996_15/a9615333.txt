Abstract    :
              This award is for support for four years of funding for a program  of biogenic
              sulfur measurements on the Siple Dome ice core.  Biogenic sulfur is a major
              aerosol-forming constituent of the  atmosphere and has potentially important
              links to the earth's  radiation budget.  Previous work on the Vostok ice core
              has  demonstrated a remarkable climate-related variability in biogenic  sulfur,
              suggesting that the sulfur cycle may act to stabilize  climate (keep the
              glacial atmosphere cool and the interglacial  atmosphere warm) in the Southern
              Hemisphere.  In this study,  methane-sulfonate (MSA) will be measured on the
              Siple Dome ice  core as part of the West Antarctic ice sheet program (WAIS). 
              Siple Dome is located in a region which is strongly impacted by  the incursion
              of marine air onto the Antarctic plateau.  Because  of its proximity to the
              coast and meteorological setting, it is  expected that variability in
              high-latitude marine biogenic sulfur  emissions should dominate the MSA record
              at this site.  In  addition to the deep ice core record, samples from shallow
              cores  will also be analyzed to provide information about regional  variability
              and decadal-to-centennial scale variability in the  deposition of
              sulfur-containing aerosols from high latitude  source regions over the past 200
              years.
