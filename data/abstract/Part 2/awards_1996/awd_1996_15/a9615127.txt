Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a three year program to study  stress transmission
              at three ice stream shear margins.  The  objectives are to determine how much
              of the motion of the ice  streams is controlled from the inter-stream ridges,
              to compare  the magnitude of this lateral drag with the driving stress on the 
              ice stream, and with ice stream width and to determine whether  lateral drag
              support is associated with lateral migration of the  margin.  The net force per
              unit ice-stream length transmitted  between ridge ice and ice-stream ice will
              be deduced from  measurements of strain rate.  Field work will entail Twin
              Otter  installation of remote camps that will each be occupied for about  12
              days during the first season and about 6 days during the  second.  The Support
              Office for Aerogeophysical Research in  Antarctica (SOAR) facility will conduct
              aerial surveys to  determine ice thickness on the inter-stream ridges, as well
              as  the ice thickness and surface slope on the ice streams.  The  field
              measurements will be complemented by repeat SPOT imagery of  Ice Stream E
              adjacent to the field site, to allow velocities in  the ice-stream side of the
              margin to be determined.  Comparing  these velocities to those obtained from
              the strain-grid surveys  will provide an estimate of the amount of softening of
              the ice in  the margins.
