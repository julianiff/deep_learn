Abstract    :
              9615269  WHITING    The Mecoptera (scorpionflies) is a small insect order of
              about 500 species distributed throughout the world.  The phylogenetic
              relationships among these insects are controversial, and there is some evidence
              that the two families currently placed in the Mecoptera should be assigned to
              their own orders.  It also appears that the fleas (Siphonaptera), whose
              relationship to other insects has long remained a mystery, are actually highly
              modified scorpionflies.    In this research project, Michael Whiting and George
              Byers will investigate phylogenetic relationships in Mecoptera by combining
              data compiled from studies on the biology, behavior, and morphology of these
              insects with data from DNA sequences.  Whiting will collect sequence data, and
              Byers will conduct morphological studies.  These data will then be used to
              provide a robust estimate of mecopteran phylogeny, using a range of
              computational techniques.      This research should answer some long-standing
              questions of insect phylogeny and yield a significant revision of insect
              classification.  The project should also provide an important base for
              evolutionary and developmental biologists who study these insects and their
              genes, and serve as a conceptual and methodological platform for future work on
              the phylogeny of organisms.
