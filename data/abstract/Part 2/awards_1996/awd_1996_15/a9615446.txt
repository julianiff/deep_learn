Abstract    :
              This study continues investigating the equilibrium structure of intense magnetic
              flux tubes, as calculated by solving the magnetostatic equation sin the thin
              flux tube approximation.  Most significant about past studies was the inclusion
              of multistream radiative transfer in cylindrical geometry, and the continuous
              transition between radiative and convective energy transport.  The flux tube's
              influence on the ambient medium was not taken into account, however, thus
              limiting previous work.  This effect is important for examining the horizontal
              temperature variation, especially at the interface between the flux tube and
              external medium.  In this study, the PIs will use a multidimensional treatment
              of radiative transfer in cylindrical geometry to include this effect.
