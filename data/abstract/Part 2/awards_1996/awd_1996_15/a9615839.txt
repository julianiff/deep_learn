Abstract    :
              AST-9615839  ABSTRACT:  J. Lutz    This research project will involve the
              investigations of  the connections between Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars,
               Post-AGB objects and Planetary Nebulae (PN) by  using PN morphologies as a
              focus for the work.  Recent  observational  studies indicate that the
              structures observed in PN shells  seem to  originate earlier in the star's
              history than was suspected  previously.  Consequently, a careful review of the
              phenomena manifested  by stars in  the evolutionary stages prior to the PN
              (i.e., AGB stars and  Post-AGB  objects) will be conducted to elucidate the
              shaping  mechanisms  (possibilities include binary star interactions,
              pulsations,  winds in  single stars, disks) for PN shells.    The research
              project has several phases.  It begins with an  investigation  of the
              literature on AGB stars and Post-AGB objects.  Additional  information will be
              gained by attending two specialized  meetings (June  and July 1997) which deal
              with current research on Stellar  Pulsations and  Cool Stars.  The observing
              phase of the research will begin  in September  1997.  Based on the knowledge
              gained in the first phase of  the research,  optical and infrared observations
              will be obtained with the  goal of  elucidating how structures emerge in PN
              shells.  The results  from the research project will be published and 
              presentations at professional meetings will be given.    These research
              activities are being carried out under the  NSF Career Advancement  Awards
              (CAA) program. The research will be done while  working in the  Astronomy
              Department at the University of Washington  with  collaborators  Bruce Balick
              and George Wallerstein, who are experts in PN  and AGB stars  respectively. 
              The Principal Investigator will be on  sabbatical leave from  the Washington
              State University during the period of the  award and thus will  be able to do
              research full time.
