Abstract    :
              DEB-9615887  SOUSA    Herbivores may influence plant community composition and
              the impact of herbivores may vary spatially.  Despite considerable conceptual
              interest, this hypothesis has been tested in few natural communities.  The
              investigators propose to examine the affect of insect herbivores on the
              distribution of mangrove species along a tidal gradient.  They will conduct
              experiments to measure the impact of the herbivores on growth and survival of
              plants in gaps versus under a closed canopy and in intertidal zones.  This
              experiment is specifically designed to detect spatial variation in the effect
              of herbivory on plant competition and will complement existing mangrove
              competition experiments at the same field site.    Mangrove forests are being
              degraded and destroyed at an alarming rate worldwide, resulting in the loss of
              highly productive ecosystems that have numerous ecological, economic, and
              aesthetic values.  The results of this project will have considerable value in
              predicting the consequences of different human-caused alterations of these
              endangered wetlands and in guiding efforts to restore mangrove communities.
