Abstract    :
              AST-9615626  Marina Fomenkova    Drs. Marina Fomenkova and Barbara Jones at the
              University of  California at San Diego will take images and spectroscopic 
              observations of comet Hale-Bopp in the infrared wavelength range  1 - 20
              micrometers in order to determine the basic physical  parameters of the nucleus
              and to monitor the changes in the state  of cometary dust grains over a large
              range of heliocentric  distances.  The project is expected to provide new
              insights into  the physical and chemical states of comets.  This award is 
              supported jointly by the Division of Astronomical Sciences and  the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for  Mathematical and Physical
              Sciences at NSF.  =======================================
