Abstract    :
                 Simulation of the models and experimental studies of MBE,  using in situ
              diagnostics (RHEED and PEO) and ex situ microscopy (STM), will be used to
              determine the effects of strain,  flux rates and temperature on surface
              morphology.  Modeling at different levels, analysis  of the connections between
              levels, and experimental validation are important for determination of the
              essential   growth modes and their  rates.  Finally we will develop a control
              method  based on a new continuum model (the "island dynamics model"), using 
              the  in situ diagnostic (RHEED) signal as the measurement variables and flux
              rates and temperature  as control variables.   An important general result of
              this project will be a methodology  that can be followed for a wide class of
              thin film growth problems.  In particular, for MBE we will  determine the
              instrumentation sensitivity required for  control of nanoscale morphology.
              Specific products of this project will include  a set of computational tools
              capable of providing parameters  for a growth recipe, and a  real-time control
              algorithm for the AlSb/InAs prototype system.  Funding for this activity will
              be provided by the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the MPS Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities, the NSF Engineering Directorate, and by DARPA.
