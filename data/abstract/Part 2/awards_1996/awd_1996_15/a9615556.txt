Abstract    :
              Abstract  EEC-9615556  Fickas    This award provides funding for development of
              Intranet capabilities of SERC developed software.    The proposed research
              addresses the next goal of SERC intranet research by taking the SERC software
              outside of the applications developed particularly for SERC to more generalized
              applications.  Using the intranet built for VSERC as a basis, the research
              proposed will "bundle" the applications of VSERC along with other capabilities
              such as text and data submission, security, text analysis, retrieval, editing
              and resubmission by remote users, and creation of a database.  The research
              builds on existing VSERC capability and other tools into a "toolkit" for the
              creation of intranet services in various settings. This research seeks to
              integrate services and capabilities into one system.
