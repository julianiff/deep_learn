Abstract    :
              9615204  Scheirer         Gravity, magnetic, side-scan sonar, and bathymetric
              data will  be collected on the east flank of the East Pacific Rise between 15 
              and 20 degrees south. This region has four anomalous features:  gravity
              lineations, abundant seamounts, asymmetric subsidence, and  asymmetric
              spreading. the primary questions: are whether there are  gravity lineations on
              the Nazca plate, does small-scale convection  in the Pacific asthenosphere
              bring about the anomalous low  subsidence of young Pacific seafloor, are the
              seamounts  symmetrically distributed about the axis, and how is the long- 
              wavelength segmentation of the ridge axis expressed off axis.
