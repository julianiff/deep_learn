Abstract    :
              Marianne Page  University of California - Davis  SBR-9615506    Recent
              discussions of sources of inequality have suggested that  individuals' human
              capital and other socioeconomic outcomes may  be strongly influenced by the
              neighborhoods in which the  individuals grew up.  Particular concern has
              focused on the role  of "underclass" neighborhoods in perpetuating poverty and
              welfare  dependency.  The purpose of this research is to identify an upper 
              bound on the socioeconomic impact of community origins by  estimating
              correlations between neighboring children in their  later socioeconomic status
              as adults.  The estimates will be  based on data from the Panel Study on Income
              Dynamics, which has  sampled neighboring children and followed them into
              adulthood.   This approach can identify only an upper bound on the influence 
              of neighborhoods because the observed neighbor correlations will  reflect the
              influence of similar family backgrounds as well as  the influence of shared
              community background.  Nevertheless,  neighbor correlations will provide
              crucial information on the  potential scope of neighborhood effects.  Large
              neighbor  correlations would leave open the possibility that neighborhoods  are
              very influential.  Small neighborhood correlations would  indicate that
              community origins must play only a minor role.
