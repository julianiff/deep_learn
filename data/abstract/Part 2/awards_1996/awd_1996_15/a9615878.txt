Abstract    :
                State to state dynamics of the interaction of small molecular ions  with well
              characterized solid surfaces is the subject of this  research project. 
              Professor Jacobs' work at the University of  Notre Dame, supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, uses state specific methods to
              prepare a beam of ions in  a particular quantum state.  This ion is then
              scattered from a  solid surface prepared and characterized in ultra high
              vacuum, and  the scattered ion identity, velocity, and energetics are 
              determined.  The results of these detailed measurements are  compared with wave
              packet calculations to enable the interpretation  of the scattering process. 
              The specific systems investigated  include N2+ and CO+ scattering from Pt(111),
              HBr+ scattering from  Si(100), and C2H2+ interacting with various metallic
              surfaces.  The  results of this work provide important basic information for
              the  mechanisms of ion etching and surface induced dissociation of  organic
              ions for mass spectrometric characterization.  A detailed mechanistic
              understanding of ion surface interactions is  vital to several technologically
              important fields, such as reactive  ion etching of semiconductors, satellite
              dynamics in low earth  orbit, and surface induced dissociation mass
              spectrometry.  The  work of this project is designed to provide this detailed 
              mechanistic understanding, using the sophisticated methods of state 
              preparation and surface scattering.
