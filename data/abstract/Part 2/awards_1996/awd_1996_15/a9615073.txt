Abstract    :
                Abstract  9615073  Rust  The Flare Genesis Experiment will use a 80 cm
              telescope to make  images and magnetograms of unprecedented  resolution (0.2
              arcsec) of the solar photosphere and chromosphere while flying from a high
              altitude, long duration balloon around the Antarctic continent.  The purpose of
              the experiment is to further understanding on how the energy stored in the
              sun's magnetic fields is converted to energetic events such as flares and
              coronal mass ejections.  This experiment can only be done from an Antarctic
              balloon (short of building a large, special purpose space craft) because
              continual viewing of the sun is necessary for periods much exceeding a day,
              which can only be achieved from polar sites, and in  order to achieve the
              required resolution the telescope must be above most of the atmosphere.    This
              project is jointly sponsored by NSF, NASA and the Air Force.  ***
