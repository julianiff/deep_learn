Abstract    :
              Dr. Dean M. Roddick, Department of Chemistry, University of Wyoming, is  
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the
              Chemistry Division for the study of the organometallic chemistry of  
              fluoroalkylphosphine transition metal complexes in acid and superacid   media.
              Preparative routes will be developed for new cationic  
              fluoroalkylphosphine-group 10 metal complexes, which incorporate weakly  
              coordinating anions, and for analogous neutral d8 metal complexes. Using   this
              inventory of compounds the general area of acid-mediated   organometallic
              chemistry will be outlined. Initially, the dimerization of   functionalized
              olefins, proton induced carbonyl insertion, ethylene/CO   copolymerization, and
              acid directed alkane functionalization will be   examined in acidic situations.
              Based on the results of this portion of   the project, the chemistry will be
              extended to solution and solid   superacid media.  Many important chemical
              reactions are carried out under acidic   conditions. However, organometallic
              compounds, which are important   laboratory and commercial catalysts and
              reagents, often are not stable in   acidic environments. This project targets a
              newly discovered class of   organometallic compounds that have remarkable
              tolerance for acidic   surroundings and aims at developing new types of metal
              catalysts that can   promote a variety of reactions in acid and superacid
              media.
