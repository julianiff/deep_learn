Abstract    :
              AST-9615610  F. Peter Schloerb    The primary goal of this project is to observe
              the evolution of  gases produced by volatile ices in the nucleus of Comet Hale-
               Bopp.  A series of regular observations of the submillimeter  lines of a
              number of cometary volatiles is underway at the James  Clerk Maxwell telescope
              on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.  This work will  continue through perihelion of the comet
              in 1997 until the comet  receeds past 6 astronomical units in order to study
              the nature of  the gases produced at different heliocentric distances.  This 
              award is supported jointly by the Division of Astronomical  Sciences and the
              Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the  Directorate for Mathematical and
              Physical Sciences at NSF.  =================================
