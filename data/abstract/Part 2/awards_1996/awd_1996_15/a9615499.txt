Abstract    :
              9615499  Meserve  This project now in its eighth year is a long-term,
              large-scale experimental manipulation examining the importance of biotic
              interactions including predation, interspecific competition and herbivory in a
              Chilean semiarid community. At the same time, responses of plants and animals
              to abiotic factors related to climatic events are being quantified. Results
              thus far have documented that vertebrate predators had major effects on numbers
              and survival of two core small mammal species, and relatively minor effects on
              opportunistic ones. Significant time by competitor interactions on numbers and
              survival of some species suggests interference effects. Heterogeneous effects
              of predator/herbivore exclusions were detected on plant cover of perennials and
              ephemerals. Seeds of several ephemeral species decreased on plots where small
              mammals were excluded suggesting positive effects of herbivory on plant species
              diversity. These biotic responses have been superimposed on strong demographic
              responses of small mammals and plants to El Nino events. During prevailing
              drought periods, biotic interactions appear less important due to extreme
              resource and water limitation. Consequently, it is vital to continue to monitor
              the biotic dynamics in response to periodic abiotic forces that vary over long
              time scales. This study is currently the longest large-scale experimental study
              of the role of biotic and abiotic factors in the temperate Neotropics.
