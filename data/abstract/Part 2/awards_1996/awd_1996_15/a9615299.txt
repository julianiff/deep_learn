Abstract    :
              9615299  LOUDA    The investigators propose to measure the impact of the
              flowerhead weevil (Rhinocyllus conicus), released for biological control of
              exotic thistles, on native plants and the insects associated with them. 
              Experiments will measure the effects of the timing of flowering by native
              thistles on the impact of weevils,   the effect of the weevil on seed
              production of native thistles, and whether superior competitive ability of the
              introduced weevil is responsible for the population decline of native insects. 
              The expected outcomes include: documentation of the extent and impact of the
              feeding by the exotic weevil on two native plants in the upper Great Plains,
              assessment of the role of plant growth patterns on weevil use and impact, and
              determination of the direct ecological consequences of shifting host use by a
              deliberately introduced insect.    The study will be the first to
              experimentally assess the ecological consequences of unintended feeding on
              native host plants by an insect deliberately introduced into the USA to control
              exotic weeds.  Biological control of weeds is increasingly advocated as an
              environmental alternative to herbicides.  Yet, few data are available with
              which to evaluate environmental risks of introducing exotic insects in
              biological control programs.  The study will provide important data on such
              consequences when transference occurs and, thus, on potential ecological risks
              associated with classical biological control of weeds.  Such information should
              prove useful in future attempts to control invasive exotic weeds.
