Abstract    :
              This interagency transfer will pay for a NASA Learjet 705.  Funds will cover the
              cost of fitting scientific instruments aboard the aircraft, as well as allowing
              30 flight hours for collecting atmospheric radon observations.  This aircraft
              is being used under the auspices of an existing grant (Mark Kritz, SUNY
              Albany), and is critical to the success of that project.
