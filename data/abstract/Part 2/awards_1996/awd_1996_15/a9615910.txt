Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of
              the Chemistry Division, Freed will continue studies of dynamical   molecular
              processes and free radicals in fluids, on surfaces, and in   related systems. 
              New electron spin resonance (ESR) relaxation and   structural techniques will
              be employed, and the necessary theoretical   frameworks will be developed and
              extended.  Two-dimensional Fourier   Transform (2D-FT) ESR, electron-electron
              double resonance (2D-ELDOR), and   Far Infrared (FIR) ESR studies of fast and
              slow motional regimes will be   developed and applied to rotational molecular
              dynamics in liquids,   presenting a multi-frequency approach covering 9-250
              GHz.  Pulsed ESR   methods will be developed at 106 GHz base on a new source
              appropriate for   liquid studies and new quasi-optical methods for FIR-ESR. 
              Other systems   investigated will be glass-forming liquids, inhomogeneous
              fluids such as   microemulsions, restricted reorientational dynamics on
              surfaces,   translational diffusion in simple and complex liquids, biradicals
              in   liquids, and radical clusters in solids.  NMR spectroscopy has been
              successfully used in a wide range of   applications, from chemical structure
              determination to medical diagnostic   scanning.  The related technique of ESR
              spectroscopy has been much slower   to be developed in part because of
              obstacles caused by the frequencies of   radiation which must be used and the
              shorter relaxation times, that is,   the time during which one can measure the
              molecular effect being   observed.  This research program will involve the
              development and   improvement of ESR techniques which may help to bring
              ESR-based methods   into more common usage as analytical tools in chemistry,
              biology, and   materials science.
