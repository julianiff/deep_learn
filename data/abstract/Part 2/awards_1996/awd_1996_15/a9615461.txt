Abstract    :
              9615461  CUNNINGHAM    Hermit crabs are best known for using empty snail shells
              as shelters. Most morphological features that define hermit crabs as a group
              seem to be adaptations to the asymmetrically coiled shell. A surprising number
              of species, however, use objects other than snail shells for shelters, or use
              no shelter at all. These hermit crabs tend to be more symmetrical than their
              shell-using relatives, and those that use no shelters are also often
              "carcinized"; that is, the abdomen is reduced and tucked under a wide, heavily
              armored carapace.  Such crabs may not be recognized as hermit crabs, but may
              instead be wrongly placed in other crab groups.  The lack of a reliable
              phylogenetic history has made it impossible to resolve long-standing questions
              concerning the evolution of shell use, asymmetry and carcinization in hermit
              crabs.    In this collaborative research project, Cliff Cunningham (molecular
              sequences) and Alan Harvey (morphology) will integrate extensive morphological
              and molecular data to generate a robust phylogeny for the hermit crabs and
              their allies (i.e., the Anomura). With this phylogeny, Cunningham and Harvey
              will determine 1) how many times anomuran crustaceans independently adopted the
              shell-using habit; 2) whether the carcinized morphology of nonshelter-using
              hermit crabs evolved from the asymmetrical morphology of shell-using hermit
              crabs, or vice versa; 3), which features of both the carcinized and
              asymmetrical morphologies are influenced by the presence and type of shelter
              used by hermit crabs.
