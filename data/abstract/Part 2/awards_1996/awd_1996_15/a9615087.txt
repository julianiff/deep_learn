Abstract    :
              9615087  Gryski  The primary objective of this project is to construct a data
              base comprised of essential appointment and leaving information for U.S.
              District Court judges from 1789-1996. The district bench underwent an explosive
              growth in the past three decades, mushrooming from around 250 judgeships in
              1960 to more than 650 today. At the same time retirements from these offices
              reached record levels, signaling perhaps a new perspective on lifetime service.
              Three types of data will be collected:  the legislative history behind the
              creation of each court and seat; information on the officeholders and their
              appointments and departures, and position histories that will enable us to
              track each position and the judges occupying it over time. The centerpiece of
              the project is position numbering. Once we establish the succession of
              occupants to every seat on each state's district bench, then all other
              objectives fall into place. The data will make it feasible to study fundamental
              questions about the federal judiciary such as the influence of
              executive-legislative relations on bench growth, or the role of senatorial
              courtesy in the appointment process.  The data will be archived as an
              electronic multi-user data base, available to the scholarly community. We will
              use the data to study: a) the partisan life cycles of the district bench, and
              how they are influenced by institutional control of the other branches; b) the
              racial and gender diversification of the district courts, and c) generational
              changes in seats.
