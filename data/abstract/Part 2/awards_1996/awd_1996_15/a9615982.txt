Abstract    :
              9615982  Hervig      This grant provides $95,210 as partial support of the costs
              of  acquiring a normal incidence electron gun (NIEG)for the Cameca 3f 
              secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) at Arizona State.  This  accessory
              compensates for charge buildup that occurs on the  surface of samples that are
              being sputtered with positively  charged ion beams of alkali metals (i.e. Cs+),
              such as is  necessary to analyze for oxygen isotopes and other  electronegative
              elements (i.e., H, C, F, Cl, P, S, As, Sb, Se).  The beam-normal geometry of
              this electron gun allows for analysis  of samples that are prone to damage from
              intense electron  bombardment that occurs using an oblique angle electron gun
              that  was designed in-house.  Addition of this accessory will allow an 
              increase in the precision (to ca. 1 per mil)and perhaps in the  lateral
              resolution of oxygen isotopic SIMS analyses of insulator  phases and thus will
              provide for nearly a factor of two increase  in the precision of their
              currently configured SIMS. The increase  in precision affordable with the
              addition of a normal incidence  electron gun will undoubtedly be used
              fruitfully by this PI in  his continued studies of the early diagenesis of
              authigenic clay  minerals, volatile element budgets in magmas based on Sulfur 
              isotopic analyses of melt inclusions in volcanic rocks and  mapping of volatile
              trace element abundances in environmental  samples.  ***
