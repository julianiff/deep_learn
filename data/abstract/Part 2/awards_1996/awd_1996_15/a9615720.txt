Abstract    :
              9615720  Emmermann      This award transfers funds to the GeoforschungsZentrum
              (GFZ) in  Germany for NSF's membership fee in the International Continental 
              Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP).  On February 26, 1996, the NSF  and the GFZ
              (a Governmentally funded, public law Foundation of the  Federal Republic of
              Germany) signed a Memorandum of Understanding  on Implementation, Management
              and Operation of the ICDP.  This MOU  is an Annex to the Agreement between the
              NSF and the Federal  Ministry for Education, Science, Research and Technology
              of the  Federal Republic of Germany (BMBF) on "Cooperation in Research in  the
              Geosciences."    The MOU stipulates that each member of ICDP will pay an annual
               membership fee to the Executive Agency (the GFZ) which will be  commingled to
              provide the base funding for the ICDP.  These funds  will be used for support
              of overall scientific planning,  management, and operation of the ICDP.  ***
