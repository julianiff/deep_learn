Abstract    :
              HARE  9615314    Host plant resistance is an effective means to protect crops
              against pests and pathogens. The value of host plant resistance in applied
              systems presents a paradox for natural systems:  if host plant resistance is so
              valuable, then why aren't all individuals of wild plant species resistant?  The
              paradox suggests that there is some cost to resistance that favors
              non-resistant plants when pests are absent.  The costs and benefits of plant
              resistance will be examined in jimson weed, Datura wrightii, where the presence
              or absence of glandular hairs is determined by a single gene.  Glandular plants
              are less suitable as hosts for the tobacco hornworm, a common insect pest of
              tobacco and tomato.  Specific objectives are: 1) to quantify the costs and
              benefits of producing glandular hairs when plants are grown under drought and
              non-drought conditions and attacked by different pest species; 2) to quantify
              the damage caused by different pest species attacking several plant populations
              along an environmental moisture gradient; 3) to predict the frequencies of
              glandular and non-glandular plants in different populations based on herbivore
              densities and cost-benefit data; and 4) to determine the mechanisms responsible
              for variation in susceptibility of glandular and non-glandular plants to
              different pest species.  Results will increase our understanding of how the
              interplay between the costs and benefits of plant resistance maintains genetic
              variation in plant defense against diverse pests.
