Abstract    :
              9615568  Mak       This award provides support for a continuing investigation 
              into the fundamental nature of winter storm tracks in the northern  hemisphere.
               The project involves three topics:  (1) the influence  of surface sensible
              heat input over the north-western Pacific and  Atlantic Oceans;  (2) the
              impacts of condensational heating on the  dynamics of storm tracks;  and (3) an
              exploration of potential  factors responsible for the mid-winter minimum in the
              Pacific storm  track.  The first two investigations will involve modeling
              studies  of the role of diabatic heating processes in the evolution of storm 
              tracks while the third will involve diagnostic studies of the  40-year global
              reanalysis data set produced by the National Centers  for Environmental
              Prediction (NCEP).         Storm tracks are the regions where synoptic scale
              eddy  activity is statistically most prevalent and intense.   Understanding the
              dynamics of storm tracks is of fundamental  interest as it relates to the
              general circulation of the atmosphere  - storm tracks are where the most of the
              poleward transport of heat  and momentum by synoptic eddies occurs.  A
              considerable portion of  the precipitation in the mid-latitudes is associated
              with storm  tracks.  Understanding and accurately simulating storm tracks has 
              obvious bearing on improving numerical weather prediction and  regional climate
              forecasting.  ***
