Abstract    :
              9615864  Magnusdottir         Many aspects of Rossby wave dynamics are still
              poorly  understood.  Under this award, Dr. Magnusdottir will investigate  how
              regions of Rossby-wave breaking, where potential vorticity is  mixed and
              nonlinear effects must be taken into account to describe  the dynamics, affect
              the rest of the atmospheric flow.  The study  will focus on the upper
              troposphere in the lower latitudes and the  stratosphere.  At issue is whether
              planetary waves are absorbed or  reflected in the wave-breaking regions. 
              Reflection/absorption  behavior is important for understanding of low-frequency
               variability and, in the stratosphere , it is relevant to sudden  warming
              events.         The principal investigator will approach this study by 
              analyzing three dimensional numerical simulations with a  mechanistic model
              used in previous studies.  For the research  involving the troposphere, the
              investigation will focus on the  impact of using a more realistic depiction of
              the tropopause and  the role of the Hadley cell;  for the stratosphere, the
              focus will  be on the role of diabatic processes.  Dr. Magnusdottir also will 
              experiment with using different basic states for the numerical  simulations and
              assess the impact.  Finally,  she will diagnose  Rossby wave activity in a more
              complex general circulation model.     ***
