Abstract    :
              Mukherjee    DMI-9615540       Laminated Metal Composite (LMC) provides a very
              high strength and exceptional fracture toughness for the transportatimn
              industry, in particular, for aerospace and high speed grould vehicle
              applications.  To realize its full potential applications, technical advances
              in near-net shape manufacturing is required.  The current state of knowledge
              regarding LMC is lacking in understanding of the microstructure and process
              characteristics of the formed LMC.  This research project investigates the
              process characteristics and the superplastic formability of multilayered
              laminated metal composites (LMC) which consists of aluminum-based metal alloy
              and metal-matrix monolithic layered materials.   The specific goal of this
              project is to understand the microstructure of the LMCs and to provide better
              control parameters in the manufacturing process.  The outcomes of this study
              could provide useful findings for die designs and a better furnace capabilities
              to carry out the effective forming operation.  This collaborative research
              project addresses fundamental issues on the characterization of microstructure
              of the near-net shape LMC manufacturing process.  The research project has a
              balance between theory and experiment, and will provide valuable findings for
              the laminated metal composite industry.
