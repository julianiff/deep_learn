Abstract    :
              9615940  Vossoughi  The "First International Conference on Cardiovascular 
              Medicine, Surgery, Science, and Mechanics" is to be held at  the Hyatt Regency
              Hotel, Bethesda, Maryland, June 6-9, 1997.    The conference will bring
              together physicians, scientists,  and biomedical engineers working on various
              aspects of  cardiovascular related research and practice.  An  International
              Advisory Committee of distinguished  investigators from 42 countries will
              contribute to the  planning of the conference program and the conduct of the 
              meeting.  The meeting is to include both podium and poster  presentations. 
              Plenary lectures will be given by experts on  topics of general interest to the
              multidisciplinary  participants and state-of-the art review papers will be 
              presented by world-class experts at the start of each  session. Of 
              significance to the development of the field of  biomedical engineering is the
              inclusion in the conference of  a student paper competition with certificates
              and cash  prizes planned.    Abstracts of presentations will be published.
              Publication of  a series "Advances in Cardiovascular Sciences" is planned 
              following the conference.  Conference presenters will be  invited to submit
              full papers as book chapters.  ***
