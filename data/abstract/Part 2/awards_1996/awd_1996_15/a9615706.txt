Abstract    :
              9615706  Sitar    The proposed project will study heteroepitaxial nucleation and
               growth of diamond films on nickel (Ni) metal substrates via hot  filament
              chemical vapor deposition.  The goal  of this research  is to produce high
              quality, single crystal diamond films up to an  area of l x l square centimeter
              on Ni substrates by using a novel  chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process
              involving seeding,  annealing, solution treatment, nucleation, and deposition.
              This  multi-step CVD technique has recently been demonstrated to be  very
              effective in suppressing graphite formation and promoting  oriented diamond
              nucleation and growth on Ni substrates. The  issues which will be investigated
              in this proposal include:  solubility of carbon in presence of atomic hydrogen,
              effect of  atomic hydrogen on the eutectic temperature; developing effective 
              seeding techniques; optimizing the multi-step deposition process;  promoting
              desired growth orientations; and performing detailed  in-vacuo surface
              characterization and modeling of the nucleation  and growth process.  %%%  The
              proposed research integrates state-of-the-art equipment and  experienced
              personnel to conduct forefront research in the field  of diamond science and
              technology. It will develop and expand our  current knowledge base of diamond
              growth and enhance the ability  to transfer a technological development out of
              the laboratory  stage into useful industrial applications. The successful 
              implementation of this program will greatly advance this vital  diamond
              technology and help the U. S. enjoy continuing global  leadership in this
              important research area.  ***
