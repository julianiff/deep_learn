Abstract    :
              9615383  Grant  The goal of the proposed research is to understand the processes
              involved in speciation and adaptive radiation.  It will be carried out on the
              small island of Daphne Major in the Galapagos archipelago. Previous research
              has shown that the three species of Darwin's Finches on the island occasionally
              hybridize. Over the past 20 years almost all individuals on the island have
              been uniquely banded, and pedigree analysis has shown that hybrids may survive
              and breed as well as or better than the parental species at certain times. The
              proposed research will build on the long-term data set to complete a
              demographic study of the three cohorts of all species and hybrids produced in
              1983, 1984 and 1987.  These will be the first complete analyses of a cohort of
              hybrids, possibly for any organism in nature. The study will involve using
              molecular methods to make unambiguous assignments of parentage, and ecological
              methods for determining the causes of variation in the fates of individuals.
              The complete data will allow a measurement of the long-term genetic fitness
              consequences of hybridization, and will allow modeling of the long-term
              dynamics of these interacting species.  This research is important for
              understanding the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. Speciation is a key
              process for generating biological diversity, yet little is known about the
              ecological and microevolutionary forces responsible for speciation. The
              proposed research takes advantage of an exceptionally favorable situation for
              directly investigating some of the forces at work in the final stages of
              speciation when hybridization is still possible. For conservation biology, the
              research will help to illuminate the ecological factors that influence genetic
              variation in small and potentially endangered populations.
