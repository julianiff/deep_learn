Abstract    :
               9615647 Feenstra  This project addresses fundamental research issues of atomic
              geometry and electronic band structure of II-VI and III-nitride materials
              configured as heterostructures with GaAs. The approach utilizes detailed
              scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements along with computer simulation
              to model strain, strain relaxation, and electronic band structure.  By coupling
              strain and critical points of the electronic bands, the PI strives for
              correlation and interpretation of STM images in terms of geometric
              configurations and electronic properties with the capability to differentiate
              between alloy constituents and band offsets of adjoining heterostructure
              layers. %%% The project addresses forefront research issues in a topical area
              of materials science having high technological relevance.  The research will
              contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to
              important aspects of electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuitry. 
              Additionally, the fundamental knowledge and understanding gained from the
              research is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the
              performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental
              understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and
              materials combinations.  An important feature of the program is the integration
              of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally
              and technologically significant area. ***
