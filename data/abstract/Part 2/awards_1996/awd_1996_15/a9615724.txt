Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Proposal No:   9615754    Proposal Type:  GOALI  Principal
              Investigator: Theodore T. Tsotsis  Affiliation:   University of Southern
              California     This grant is awarded through the Interfacial, Transport and
              Separations Processes Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division,
              and the NSF Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)
              Program.  The Principal Investigator is Dr. Theodore Tsotsis of the University
              of Southern California. An academic and industrial collaborative research
              program is to be implemented aimed at developing a better fundamental
              understanding of the phenomena involved during the preparation of carbon
              molecular sieve (CMS) membranes. These membranes show excellent promise for
              many reactor and separation applications and are made via the carbonization in
              inert and/or reactive atmospheres of polymeric thin films which are either
              self-supported or coated on various porous substrates. The emphasis in this
              project is the understanding of  the factors in the preparation procedure which
              are critical to the ability of these materials to effect separation of mixtures
              based on differences in molecular mobility within the membrane.  Carbon
              molecular sieve membranes have tremendous potential in the separation of
              hydrocarbon and reformate mixtures. The ability to tailor the structure of a
              particular membrane to fit a particular separation and/or reactor application
              will greatly enhance the technological significance of these systems and expand
              their use into many new applications. A key requirement here is the development
              of predictive models of the pore structure and of transport and sorption
              characteristics of reactant mixtures. This is a main area of emphasis in the
              project, which will significantly advance the technological base in this area.
