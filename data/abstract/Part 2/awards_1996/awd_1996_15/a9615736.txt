Abstract    :
              George Stell is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue his research in the   statistical mechanics of
              liquids.  The research is directed at trying to   understand complex fluid
              properties in terms of the long and short range   interactions between
              idealized particles.  Variations of the   Ornstein-Zernike integral equation
              method are used which are validated by   Monte Carlo simulations.  Special
              emphasis is placed on understanding   ionic and dipolar fluids as well as
              fluids that are chemically   associating.  The role of ionic association due to
              strong electrostatic   interactions is being studied with special focus on the
              effect that   ion/ion pair and ion-pair/ion-pair interactions have on the  
              thermodynamics of phase separation and on fluid structure near the   critical
              point.    This research provides an important molecular level understanding of
              the   detailed interaction of molecular species in condensed phases.  This  
              level of understanding is important in the field of chemistry since the   large
              majority of chemical reactions take place either in aqueous   solution or in
              the liquid phase.  A more thorough understanding of the   thermodynamic and
              transport properties of condensed phase systems,   particularly ionic and polar
              fluids, will aid in the design and   engineering of efficient chemical
              engineering processes.
