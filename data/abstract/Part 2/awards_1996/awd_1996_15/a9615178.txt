Abstract    :
              9615178  MEYER    Cichlid fishes of Lake Tanganyika, the oldest of the great
              African rift lakes, represent a paradigm example of unprecedented diversity in
              morphology, behavior, and ecology that occurred over a geologically-short
              period of time.  Lake Tanganyika cichlids display a complexity of differences
              in external shape and coloration, breeding systems, parental care patterns, and
              trophic specializations that are not found elsewhere.  Lake Tanganyika also is
              pivotal in the geographic history of eastern Africa, and undoubtedly served as
              the bio-reservoir from which ancestors to species in other African rift lake
              were derived.    The research to be carried out by Dr. Axel Meyer will employ
              nucleotide sequences from two different, mitochondrially-encoded genes and from
              three different, nuclear-encoded genes to investigate genealogical
              relationships among the twelve tribes (representing 170 species in 50 genera)
              of cichlids in Lake Tanganyika.  These DNA sequences will be used to generate a
              molecular scaffold that will provide answers to critical questions regarding
              the origin and diversification of the morphological, behavioral, and ecological
              specializations that characterize these fishes.  Answers to these questions
              have implications to the understanding of east African cichlids fish
              assemblages, and in a general sense, to understanding of adaptive radiation and
              biological theory.
