Abstract    :
              9615475  WHITTAM   Biologists are trying to understand how organisms that cause
              infectious diseases originate and evolve.  Under what conditions do
              disease-causing organisms become deadlier (more virulent) or "friendlier" (less
              virulent) to the host?  To address this question, the proposed research will
              examine evolution of virulence in the laboratory of a model system using
              bacterium Legionella pneumophila (a cause of Legionnaires disease), a parasite
              in nature of protozoans (amoebae).  Laboratory populations of the bacterium and
              protozoan will be grown together under conditions that favor (or disfavor)
              invasion of the amoebae by bacteria.  Both the ability of the bacteria to
              invade cells and the degree of host resistance to invasion will be measured as
              the parasite and host coevolve in the laboratory.  The amount of evolutionary
              change will be compared to identical measurements taken from Legionella and
              amoebae from natural situations.  Genes required for invasion will be studied
              to test recent theory that predicts how the virulence of parasites will evolve
              in specific environments.
