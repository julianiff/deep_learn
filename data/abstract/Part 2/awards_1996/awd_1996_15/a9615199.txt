Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT    PROPOSAL # : DEB-9615199    INVESTIGATOR(S) : FERNANDEZ,
              RUSTAD, KAHL, NORTON    INSTITUTION:  UNIVERSITY OF MAINE      The aims of this
              research are to continue treatment and monitoring of a paired watershed
              experiment at Bear Brook in northern Maine, with an emphasis on changes in soil
              base cations, particularly calcium.  Base cation depletion is well-recognised
              as a potential problem in soils that have been subjected to acidic N deposition
              but few data exist from well-controlled, long-term experiments.  The Bear Brook
              watershed has been periodically treated with ammonium sulfate since the fall of
              1989 and is believed to be approaching N saturation. Since 1993 the
              relationship between base cations and strong acid anions has changed, such that
              labile Ca and Mg may be depleted in the soils as Al losses increase. Continued
              monitoring will allow tests of a series of hypotheses about controls and
              mechanisms of cation retention and leaching in temperate forest soils.
