Abstract    :
              This action provides supplementary funds for Dr. Fred Wendorf's archaeological
              research in the Sinai Desert of Egypt. They will permit him to overhaul two
              research vehicles which will be used to conduct an archaeological survey of the
              El-Gorafi Basin. The sites in this region may represent the oldest agricultural
              villages in Egypt, a major cradle of civilization. The architecture in the dry
              desertic region is extremely well-preserved. The cultural materials associated
              with the sites appear to be different from those found in the Levant and in the
              Nile Valley. They may open a completely new perspective on the prehistory of
              the Sinai Desert and Egypt.  Some of the sites are situated in localities which
              will soon be leveled and reclaimed for agriculture. Others are in areas where
              new settlements are likely to be placed and those which are not destroyed by
              housing will likely be robbed for building stone. It is important that these
              materials be recorded and that excavation take place. These data will be of
              interest to many archaeologists and shed new light on the rise of complex
              societies.
