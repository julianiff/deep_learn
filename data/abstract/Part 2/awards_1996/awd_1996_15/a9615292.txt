Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a program to reconstruct the record  of atmospheric
              carbon dioxide (and the carbon-13 isotopes of  carbon dioxide) over several
              intervals, including the Last  Glacial Maximum-Holocene transition,
              interstadial episodes, the  mid-Holocene, the last 1000 years and the
              penultimate glacial  period, using ice from the Taylor Dome and Vostok ice
              cores.  The  major objective of this study is to investigate the phase 
              relationship between variations of the greenhouse gases occluded  in the ice
              cores and temperature changes (indicated by oxygen and  deuterium isotopes)
              during the last deglaciation.  In addition,  the concentration of atmospheric
              carbon dioxide over the past  1000 years and during the mid-Holocene will be
              determined in  these cores.
