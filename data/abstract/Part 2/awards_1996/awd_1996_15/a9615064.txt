Abstract    :
              This research continues exploring ionospheric dynamics and composition by
              utilizing computer models embodying relevant physics and applying observations
              as constraints and boundary conditions.  The relative composition of O+, H+ and
              He+ in the low and middle latitude topside ionosphere depends on solar
              activity, season, local time, latitude and the daily variability of ExB drifts
              and neutral winds in the F-region.  The PI will determine the sensitivity of
              all these parameters to successfully interpret data from satellites and
              recently upgraded radars.  He will use a newly improved ionosphere model,
              including a realistic magnetic field geometry, to perform these studies and
              compare results with observations from satellites and ground-based radars.     
              Observations of depleted plasma regions at low latitudes show so-called
              'bubbles' moving upward to very high altitudes.  Motion of these depleted
              regions depends on the flux tube integrated conductivity, which depends on the
              redistribution of the plasma along the magnetic flux tube taking place as a
              result of its upward motion.  To further understand the large scale dynamics of
              plasma bubbles, the PI will employ a single flux tube model of the ionosphere
              to incorporate drift dependent on the spatial variations in the flux tube
              integrated conductivity.
