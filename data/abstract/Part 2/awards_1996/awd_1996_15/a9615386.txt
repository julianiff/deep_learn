Abstract    :
              This award is for one year of support to convene a workshop on  subglacial rock
              drilling in the Antarctic.  Only 2% of the  Antarctic territory is ice-free and
              accessible to direct  geological sampling and research.  Many areas of research
              have a  need to know what kinds of rocks and sediments occur beneath the  ice
              sheet.  Most of the processes that lead to fast ice streaming  flow are located
              at the base of the ice sheet and involve basal  conditions and basal materials.
               In fact, active volcanism may be  a crucial element of the dynamics of the
              West Antarctic ice  sheet.  In addition, much of the paleontological record is
              stored  beneath the ice sheet and is inaccessible to direct sampling.  Hence
              the need seems to be great for drilling access boreholes  through the ice to
              get samples for studying the basal geology and  basal conditions.  A workshop
              on subglacial drilling will bring  out the interest and need from the
              scientific community and will  allow for an assessment of the presently
              available technologies.  Additional requirements from all parties need to be
              gathered so  that the technology that is developed will be of use for a wide 
              range of interests.  The outcome of this workshop will be an  implementation
              plan that will spell out in more detail how to  reach the specific scientific
              goals of the different groups  interested in subglacial rock drilling.
