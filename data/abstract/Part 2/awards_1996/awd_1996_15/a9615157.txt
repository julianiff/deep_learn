Abstract    :
              Abstract  9615157  Hernandez  It is possible to deduce the temperature and
              windspeed of the atmosphere by measuring the emission spectra of certain trace
              gasses, especially of those which are confined to fairly narrow altitude
              regions.  This project uses a Fabry-Perot infrared interferometer located at
              South Pole, Antarctica, to look at the band spectra of several trace species,
              most importantly the hydroxyl radical (OH), in orthogonal directions.  By
              determining the Doppler shift of the lines the winds can be measured, while the
              brightness and line ratios within the bands provide density and temperature
              information.  The OH is the atmosphere is primarily found in a narrow band near
              90 km altitude.  The fact that the measurements are being made at the axis of
              rotation of Earth significantly limit the types of planetary waves, thus
              simplifying the study of the large scale dynamics of the atmosphere.  ***
