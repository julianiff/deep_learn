Abstract    :
              9615712  Lyons    This grant provides $82,965 as one-half support of the cost of
               acquiring an inductively-coupled plasma optical emission  spectrometer
              (ICP-OES).  An ICP-OES is uniquely suited to the  reserach conducted by these
              PI's on the low temperature redox  geochemistry of organic -rich shales and the
              redox chemistry of  anoxic waters from the Cariaco Basin on the continental
              shelf of  Venezuela.  ICP-OES has superior capabilities for analyses of the 
              light elements Fe, S and P in seawater over an ICP-MS do to the  decreased
              sensitivity of an ICP-OES to matrix effects in samples  with high total
              dissolved salt contents and isobaric  interferences which plague ICP-MS
              analyses of Fe, S and P.  Additional studies that will utilize the capabilities
              of the ICP-  OES will include, major cation analysis of groundwaters to trace 
              flow directions and contaminant transport and geochemical studies  of
              leucogranite petrogenesis.  ***
