This planning grant is directed towards development of an
              innovative Industrial Research Master's Program in Materials Science and
              Engineering. The program is intended specifically for students planning on
              careers in industrial research and development. A critical element of this
              program is the design of a curriculum which effectively prepares the students
              for careers in industry. The new Master's program will be designed to bridge
              the gap between the long term basic research of the traditional university
              Ph.D. program and the shorter term focus of research and development in
              industry. The planning grant aims at developing a consensus among industrial
              leaders and educators on strategies to best prepare students for the changing
              industrial environment. A workshop on materials industries needs in future
              hires and surveys of materials science and engineering programs and BS students
              in industry will help define approaches needed. These strategies will be
              articulated in a detailed proposal for consideration by the Division of
              Materials Research. This education grant is funded through the MPS Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities and the Division of Materials Research..

This grant promotes novel opportunities for students to prepare for academic,
              industrial, government and non-traditional roles (such as communication,
              business, leadership, ethics, mentoring) and assists in integration of research
              and training with curricula.
