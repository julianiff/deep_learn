Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9615143  Pearlman    The analog technology of television is in the
              process of changing to the recently approved FCC High Definition Television
              Standard which is digital.  Although digital video is mature enough to generate
              and deliver digital video alot of research is necessary to enhance and broaden
              the current capability.  This award provides funding for a planning meeting for
              an industry/university meeting to determine if there is sufficient industrial
              support to establish an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
              Digital Video at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.    The envisioned research
              agenda of the proposed Center would address: digital image and video
              processing, filtering; image, video, and audio compression; communications -
              terrestrial, cable, and satellite; networked video and high speed switching ;
              multimedia; content creation; semiconductors and materials (VLSI); servers and
              mass storage; and displays.
