Abstract    :
              Spire Corporation  Ward Halverson    This Small Business Innovation Research
              (SBIR) Phase II project will develop zinc gallate (ZnGa2O4) as a thin-film
              phosphor and produce full color faceplates by selective ion implantation of
              luminescence centers.  Field emission displays (FEDs) based on
              cathodoluminescent phosphors are promising alternatives to active matrix liquid
              crystal displays; however, conventional sulfide-based powder phosphors
              compromise FED performance due to their granular nature, current-saturation
              characteristics, and limited operating lifetime.  Replacing powdered phosphors
              with sulfur-free, thin film oxide materials can improve chromaticity, allow
              much finer definition, and increase phosphor lifetime, while reducing
              manufacturing costs.  Phase I demonstrated bright red and green
              cathodoluminescence (CL) in sputter-deposited ZnGa2O4 which was ion implanted
              with europium and manganese; and bright blue CL was found from "self-activated"
              (Ga-rich) zinc gallate films.  Phase II will optimize phosphor preparation, ion
              implantation and annealing, and increase external luminous efficiency by
              minimizing light-guiding in the thin-film phosphor.  Organometallic chemical
              vapor deposition of ZnGa2O4 will be compared to sputter-deposition of the thin
              film phosphor host.  A wider range of activator and co-activator ions and
              annealing schedules will be investigated.  Multi-colmr phosphor faceplates will
              be fabricated and demonstrated in an operating FED device.    Flat, field
              emission displays with high luminance, wide color gamut, high electrical
              efficiency, and long operating life will find applications in computer
              terminals, lap-top computers, instrument panels, navigational aids, and
              consumer electronics from cellular telephones to television sets.
