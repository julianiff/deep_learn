Abstract    :
              9615997  Bock         Global Positioning System (GPS) technology allows near
              real-  tine determination of position anywhere on Earth with precision in  the
              sub-centimeter range.  It is making a profound impact on  understanding of
              diverse scientific problems in the geosciences,  including plate motions,
              earthquake cycles, crustal dynamics,  volcanic processes, glacier dynamics, sea
              level changes, and  atmospheric sensing.  This award provides funding to
              support part  of the infrastructure needed for GPS-based studies by earth 
              scientists.  The University NAVSTAR Consortium (UNAVCO) provides 
              infrastruacture support in a number of areas, including data  archiving and
              data analysis.  This award to the University of  California at San Diego, a
              member of the UNAVCO consortium, will  support an archival data base from
              regional GPS networks that will  be available on-line to the geophysics
              research community.  ***
