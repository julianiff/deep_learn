Abstract    :
              OPP 9615254  Wannamaker    Abstract    The award supports a project to extend
              knowledge of the thermal  and physico-chemical state (fluids, melts) of the
              deep crust and  upper mantle of Antarctica with magnetotelluric (MT) profiling
              of  the South Pole area.  In the MT method, temporal variations in  the Earth's
              natural electromagnetic (EM) field are used as source  fields to probe the
              electrical resistivity structure in the depth  range of 1 to 100 kilometers
              (km), or more.  Geophysical methods  such as MT are appropriate in Antarctica
              because of the  predominance of thick ice cover (95% of the surface) and the 
              difficult operating environment.  The effort will consist of  about 16 sites
              over a length of 90 km, offset from South Pole  station about 5 km and oriented
              grid NE-SW, normal to the  Transantarctic Mountains (TAM).  The main purposes
              are three-  fold.  First, the method will test the cratonic character of the 
              lithosphere of this part of East Antarctica to depths of 100-150  km and will
              allow comparison of its resistivity structure with  that imaged in extensional
              central West Antarctica (CWA) by the  same research group.  Second, this
              experiment will be conducted  over the very thick and cold ice sheet extant at
              South Pole,  conditions that are very different those at CWA, so that this 
              project should make MT surveying more feasible over the entire  continent. 
              Third, the results will provide the crustal response  baseline for possible
              long-term MT monitoring to lower mantle  depths at South Pole.  This experiment
              should lead to important  advances in understanding of the crustal and mantle
              structure of  the central part of the Antarctic continent.
