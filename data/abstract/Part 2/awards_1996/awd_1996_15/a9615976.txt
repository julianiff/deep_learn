Abstract    :
              SRS 96-15976  Link  The purpose of this  innovative study is to explore the 
              feasibility of developing a database of quantitative  information on the
              licensing patterns of U. S. firms.  It is  expected that this database will
              provide the first  systematic information across firms and industries on the 
              propensity to acquire technical knowledge through licensing  arrangements
              rather than through their R&D or through other  external sources.  Moreover,
              licensing activity appears,  based on the limited stylized information
              available, to be  an important element of the portfolio of sources of 
              technical knowledge that firms draw upon as a part of their  overall innovative
              strategy.    The proposed study ventures into an important research area, 
              namely understanding and documenting across industries an  element of a firm's
              portfolio of technical information  previously unexplored.  While the broad
              topic of sources of  technical information is established in the innovation 
              related literature, a new, albeit exploratory, approach for  documenting
              patterns of licensing activity is being offered.  The proposed procedure uses
              legal decisions to identify  licensing activities and then matches the parties
              to those  licensing arrangements to patent citations.  The evidence on 
              licensing and patent citations is then used to predict  licensing patterns
              across industries.  The general use of  citation counts to explore technology
              flows is in its  infancy.   This study attempts to combine in a novel way 
              citation counts for patents with evidence about licensing  obtained from legal
              decisions.  If this approach is  successful,  the investigators will have begun
              to fill the  conspicuous void in information about the licensing of 
              technology.  ***
