Abstract    :
                Key contributors to research and education networking are being invited to
              participate in this strategic workshop.  This will be the third in a series and
              will build on the FARNET/NTTF joint meeting on April 15 and16 in Washington, DC
              as well as the  Monterey workshop on the NII and Higher Education in Sept.
              1995.  The earlier meetings convened members of leading higher education,
              research and supporting organizations to better understand the needs and
              requirements of higher education for  advanced networking.  The participants at
              the Monterey conference  in September of 1995, were in general agreement that  
               1) the requirements for communications for tomorrow1s university are not
              clearly articulated and    2) leadership, and perhaps services exclusively from
              the private sector are not likely to provide the solution.    These conclusions
              spawned a number activities addressing both issues.  A number of draft strategy
              documents addressing the fulfillment of those needs and requirements were
              presented at the April 15-16 Washington, DC meeting.  Our objectives at the 
              Colorado Springs-Cheyenne Mountain Resort workshop will be to further develop
              and evaluate those models, discuss and evaluate critical technical issues, and
              discuss alliances and organizational structure to implement the strategy.
