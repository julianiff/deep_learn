Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a three year project to measure the  vertical
              strain rate as a function of depth at two sites on Siple  Dome Antarctica.  Ice
              flow near a divide such as Siple Dome is  unique in that it is predominantly
              vertical.  As a consequence,  the component of ice deformation in the vertical
              direction, the  "vertical strain rate"  is dominant.  Its measurement is 
              therefore important for the calibration of dynamic models of ice  flow.  Two
              different, relatively new, high resolution systems for  its measurement in hot
              water drilled holes will be employed.  The  ice flow model  resulting from te
              measurements and flow law  determination will be used to interpret the shapes
              of radar  internal layering in terms of the dynamic history and  accumulation
              patterns of Siple Dome over the past 10,000 years.  The resulting improved
              model will also be applied to the  interpretation of annual layers thicknesses
              (to produce annual  accumulation rates) and borehole temperatures from the ice
              core  to be drilled at Siple Dome during the 1997/98 field season.  The 
              results should permit an improved analysis of the ice core,  relative to what
              was possible at recent coring sites in central  Greenland.  This is a
              collaborative project between the  University of Alaska, the University of
              California, San Diego and  the University of Washington.
