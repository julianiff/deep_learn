Abstract    :
              BERTNESS  DEB-9628743  The objective of this proposal is to examine the role of
              nutrient levels in determining the distribution and abundance of salt marsh
              plants species.  Preliminary experiments indicate that nutrient levels
              influence the competitive ability of marsh plants by changing the focus of
              competition from belowground to aboveground.  This suggests that differences in
              marsh vegetation patterns are the result of tradeoffs between above and
              belowground competition as nutrient levels change.  The investigators will
              experimentally investigate the mechanisms responsible for the linkage between
              nutrients and competitive ability and the relationship between nutrient
              supplies and marsh vegetation patterns.  The variables that contribute to the
              distribution patterns of species along environmental gradients are of interest
              to resource managers.  Results from this study will provide an important tool
              in helping ecologists predict the consequences of anthropogenic nutrient
              additions on native plant communities.
