Abstract    :
                    This proposal is to participate in a new ice core deep drilling effort in
              North Greenland (NGRIP).  The effort will be led by the Danish ice core group
              with participation for scientists from six other nations.  This proposal is to
              measure stable isotope ratios of snow and ice in collaboration with scientists
              in Denmark and France.  Stable isotope ratios in snow record changes in air
              temperature, and are thus a basic component of ice coring efforts as they
              provide a temperature record of the past. The focus is on the isotopic record
              from the last millennium, and from sharp transitions in the past.  Comparisons
              with historical records of climate change have shown that isotopes in Greenland
              ice record regional scale climate change.  As the ice core records are extended
              into the past and compared with other proxy records of climate change, we are
              seeing that different modes of climate behavior may have existed prior to the
              historical record.  Thus, ice cores contain and annually resolvable record of
              past climate which can help form the baseline against which future climate
              fluctuations and shifts can be measured.  Also, previous ice cores from
              Greenland have shown that large and rapid climate changes, as much as
              temperature changes in only a few years, have occurred in the past. These
              changes need to be confirmed and models constructed to explain how they
              occurred in the past, and if they could occur in the future.   Finally, the
              nature of interglacial climate is an unresolved issue that needs to be
              addressed.  Past results from ice cores have suggested that the last
              interglacial was highly variable.  This result is questionable, however, and
              needs to be confirmed with a new deep ice core in Greenland.
