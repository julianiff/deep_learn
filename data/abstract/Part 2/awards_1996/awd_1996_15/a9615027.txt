Abstract    :
              9615027  Rogers  Researchers at MIT-Haystack Observatory, in collaboration with
              researchers at Seagate Tape Technology Inc., will design an improved head-tape
              interface for use in linear magnetic tape recorders.  Improved thin film head
              technology is necessary for applications in which vast amounts of data must be
              stored in a fast and inexpensive means.  Current thin-film tape head design
              will be improved through experimentation to investigate wear at low contact
              pressures, and through the computer-modeling of the head-tape interface.  ***
