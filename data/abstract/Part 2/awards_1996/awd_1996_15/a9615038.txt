Abstract    :
              Fritz, R. S.  DEB-9615038    This project will study the consequences of plant
              hybridization on resistance to plant-feeding insects and a rust pathogen.  The
              PIs will use a model system of two willow species (Salix sericea and S.
              eriocephala) that naturally hybridize in large parts of their range.  Molecular
              markers will be used to establish the purity of parents used in crosses and for
              identifying naturally introgressed plants.  The study will use comparisons of
              resistance among genetic classes of willows growing in the two parental
              environments, and will measure the effects of genetic class and environment on
              fitness of seedlings in the presence and absence of a rust pathogen.  The study
              will also determine experimentally if introgression affects resistance of
              introgressed plants compared to pure parents.      Hybrid plants are widely
              used for agricultural and forest tree breeding.  These plants often have growth
              and yield characteristics that make them more productive for commercial use. 
              In several cases, however, hybrid plants have been found to be highly
              susceptible to disease.  Understanding the consequences of hybridization on
              resistance may be important to controlling insect damage and diseases in hybrid
              populations and could reveal environmental and genetic factors that will
              improve commercial success of hybrid plants in agriculture and forestry.
