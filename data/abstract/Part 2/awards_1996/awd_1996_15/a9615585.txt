                ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:  CTS-9615585  Principal Investigator:  Mungal   
              This is a grant to apply the PIV measurement  technique to the study of
              compressible mixing layers.  This study should give new insight compressible
              mixing. The study will focus on the mechanisms by  which freestream fluids are
              entrained, gain or lose momentum and become turbulent.   Fluctuating 
              velocities, Reynolds stress, strain rates and dilatation will be measured
              directly.  By simultaneously  imaging the scalar mixing field with the PIV
              vector field,  a comparison between the two instantaneous  fields can be made. 
               This will provide new information on the nature of compressible turbulence. 
              Studies will also be made of the interaction between shock structures and
              turbulence.  It is hoped that this work will provide guidance to theoretical
              modelers.    The understanding of compressible mixing layers  in supersonic 
              flow is of great interest form both a fundamental and applications viewpoint. 
              The research program fully utilizes a well equipped laboratory, providing
              significant leverage to the NSF support.
