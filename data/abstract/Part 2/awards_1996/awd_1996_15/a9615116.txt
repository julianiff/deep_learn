Abstract    :
              This research will focus on a comprehensive program which probes the   fluxional
              dynamics of unsolvated (RLi)n hyperaggregates, Li spin counting   in (RLi)n
              clusters, modes of ion-ion reorientation within ion pairs,   variable
              delocalization resulting from stereochemistry of internal   solvation of Li,
              steric effects of structure, conjugated dianion salts,   Li-C,C double bond
              coordination and chemistry and Nuclear Magnetic   Resonance (NMR) properties of
              ion pairs in liquid crystal medium.   The   experimental work will also be
              complemented by calculations. With this   renewal award, the Organic Dynamics
              Program is supporting the research of   Dr. Gideon A. Fraenkel of the
              Department of Chemistry at Ohio State   University.  Professor Fraenkel will
              focus his work on determining the   solution structures of organolithium
              compounds using Nuclear Magnetic   Resonance (NMR) techniques.  The versatile
              and useful synthetic chemistry   shown by this class of compounds makes this
              structural work even more   important.
