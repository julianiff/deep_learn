Abstract    :
              RAUSHER  DEB-9615227    The chemical content of plants affects insect survival
              and reproduction and thus may influence the size of insect populations.  In a
              phenomenon known as induced resistance, some plants respond to herbivore attack
              by producing new compounds which negatively affect insect growth and
              reproduction.  Understanding the effects of inducible resistance on insect
              herbivores is important for understanding herbivore population regulation
              because the strength of the response may increase as insect populations and
              insect damage increases.  Consequently, inducible resistance may be a negative
              feed-back mechanism that helps regulate insect populations.  The investigator
              will perform experiments with soybeans and Mexican bean beetles to determine
              whether induced resistance can regulate insect populations.  Soybean cultivars
              that vary genetically in inducible response will be used to compare the
              population dynamics of the bean beetle on soybean cultivars with high and low
              levels of inducible response.  The PI will use computer modeling to investigate
              what conditions make regulation by induced resistance possible.      It is
              important to understand how herbivore populations are regulated because insects
              strongly affect the yield of commercially important plants.  If inducible
              resistance can control insect populations, agricultural breeders may want to
              include induced resistance in their breeding programs.  Inducible resistance
              may be preferable to the use of constant levels of plant defense because
              induced resistance may slow the insect's development of resistance to plant
              defenses.
