Abstract    :
              Jayne  9615047     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              addresses both performance and cost issues associated with developing
              commercially viable Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs). Specifically, a high
              utilization, low catalyst loading membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) for a
              direct methanol proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell will be developed.
              During Phase I, PSI Technology's (PSIT's) patented electrochemical catalyzation
              (ECC) technique was successfully adapted to electrodeposit Pt-Ru alloys with
              specific composition and morphology. Methanol oxidation performance for the
              resultant ECC anode with a catalyst loading of 2.0 mg/cm2 was shown to be
              equivalent to the unsupported Pt-Ru alloy at a loading of 5.0 mg/cm2, which
              exceeded the goals of the Phase I program. The Phase II research will encompass
              both the anode and the cathode of a DMFC. The cathode work consists of both
              electrode structure and ECC optimization. The anode research continues the
              Phase I work by attempting additional alterations of the electrode structure
              and/or increasing the catalyst loading, both of which could lead to still
              higher performance. In addition, the technique developed during Phase I for
              alloy electrodeposition will be applied to ternary alloys such as Pt-Ru-WO3,
              for which recent literature suggests even higher methanol oxidation activity.
              Lastly, the Phase II research targets another high cost component of DMFCs by
              investigating procedures to prepare the MEA without using the costly carbon
              fiber paper backing that is currently employed. By widening the scope of the
              research to include optimization of the cathode and anode, investigation of
              ternary alloy electrodeposition, and alternative, less expensive support
              structures, hindrances to commercializing the direct methanol PEM fuel cell are
              more fully addressed.   Successful commercialization of this technology will
              substantially improve the cost effectiveness of DMFCs for vehicular
              applications as well as for stationary power generation.
