              ABSTRACT    PROPOSAL # : DEB-9615429    INVESTIGATOR(S) : GLASER et al.   
              INSTITUTION: UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA    TITLE:  Hydrologic Drivers for the
              Carbon Dynamics in Large Peatlands     The large peat basins of North America
              represent an important reservoir in the global carbon cycle and a significant
              source for greenhouse gases.  The development of regional groundwater models as
              part of this research should provide a powerful method to quantify the impact
              of climatic change on the water and carbon flux of these peatlands, because
              these groundwater models can be realistically calibrated by field observations,
              digital elevation models, and remote sensing. These models will be developed
              and tested in the Glacial Lake Agassiz region of Minnesota.     The design of
              this research is interdisciplinary and combines field measurements, modeling,
              and remote sensing to determine 1) the regional topography of the water table
              and is response to short- and longer term climatic changes, 2) the effect of
              water table fluctuations on flow systems, solute transport, and carbon flux
              through these ecosystems, 3) the frequency and magnitude of carbon losses from
              peat fires, and 4) regional estimates for the water and carbon balance.  The
              design includes investigation of the apparent inconsistency between the
              relatively high rates of peat accumulation in the region combined with high
              emission rates for methane in a fairly dry regional climate.
