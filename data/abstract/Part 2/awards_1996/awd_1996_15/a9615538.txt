Abstract    :
                  9615538  LI  The project consists on providing financial assistance for 12
              leading American specialists in the mechanics and technology of brittle matrix
              composites (BMC) for their participation at the next International BMC 5
              Symposium in Poland, October 13-15, 1997.      The participation of a
              representative group of American specialists will considerably enhance the role
              of the Symposium BMC 5, and stimulate international cooperation.  It will also
              benefit the American research community in keeping abreast of European research
              and development in ceramic and cementitious composites, and their manufacturing
              and industrial applications.  We expect to hear some research reports coming
              from the European Community (EC) joint projects such as those supported under
              the BRITE and EUREKA programs.
