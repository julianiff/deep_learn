Abstract    :
              9615583  Grossman        This research involves participation in an integrated
              observational and  modeling effort that includes planning and conducting the
              1997 field campaign for  the Cooperative Atmosphere-Surface Exchange Study
              (CASES-97) and subsequent  data analysis.  CASES-97 will be conducted for a
              four-week period in May, 1997, in  the Argonne Boundary Layer Facility (ABLF)
              located in the southern two-thirds of  the Walnut River watershed, southeast of
              Wichita, Kansas.        The specific objectives of the research supported under
              this award are:             Document the diurnal cycle of the fair-weather
              planetary boundary layer (PBL) in  terms of both surface properties and the
              budget equations of the PBL profiles of  wind, temperature and humidity;     
              Relate diurnal variation of PBL profiles and depth to surface processes, the 
              presence of clouds and entrainment;      Collaborate with other researchers to
              test PBL and surface schemes in numerical  models;      Optimize the design of
              planned long-term PBL and surface observations in the  ABLF and CASES arrays,
              through comparing ABLF profiles to independent  observational data, and through
              evaluating degradation of budget calculations when  CASES-97 measurements are
              selectively eliminated.  ***
