Abstract    :
              9615690  Khoshnevis       This award funds investigation of the concept of a
              single  centralized station to provide supervision, sensing, control, 
              intelligence, and perhaps power to a colony of robots, organized  for the
              performance of specific tasks.  The consequence of such  an approach is that
              each robot can be made much simpler, smaller,  and less expensive, since
              requirements for on-board sensing,  control, and intelligence are reduced or
              even eliminated.  Human  capability for supervising and controlling multiple
              robots may  also be augmented by this approach.  The issues to be studied 
              concern tradeoffs in control (bandwidth, accuracy, and channel  capacity);
              relations between numbers of controllable robots and  task suitability; and
              representation for control.
