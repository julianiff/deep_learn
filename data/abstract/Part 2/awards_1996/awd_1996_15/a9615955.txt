Abstract    :
                9615955  Low    This project will explore new ways to reach a broadcast
              audience wider than those who normally would watch an NSF funded television
              program on PBS.  The PI will define new, non-competitive relationships between
              PBS and other broadcast or cable venues and will explore incentives for
              pursuing such relationships.  The specific tasks to be conducted under the
              grant include:  developing and testing procedures for distributing a program or
              series in a venue in addition to PBS, implementing such distribution, and
              evaluating the impact on audience size in the new venue as well as on
              subsequent broadcast on PBS.  The final report will document the results of
              this research and describe the steps required to arrange for multiple venues.  
               This project represents examination of an untested idea, the results of which
              may establish the basis for significantly increasing the impact of broadcast
              programming supported by NSF.  Traditionally, when PBS has agreed to schedule a
              program or series, they have insisted on a window of exclusivity for a period
              three years.  If the data from this project indicates that broadcast of a PBS
              program in a new venue reaches new audiences and, potentially, attracts some of
              that audience to PBS, it should establish a more open attitude on the part of
              PBS toward multiple venues at a much earlier time.
