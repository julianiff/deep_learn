Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at Brandeis University to acquire a
              400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This  equipment will enhance research in a number of
              areas including the following: (1) rational  design of enzyme inhibitors and
              studies of enzyme mechanisms, (2) synthesis and mechanistic  studies of
              biologically active natural products, (3) structure/function studies of trypsin
              and  mechanistic studies of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, (4) short
              syntheses of major  natural products and development of new synthetic
              reactions, (5) protein dynamics by NMR and  ion pair structure and dynamics,
              and (6) total synthesis of biologically active natural products.    Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to 
              chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
              identify unknown  substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms
              within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules
              in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from  these NMR
              studies are useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
