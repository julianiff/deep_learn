Abstract    :
              9615640  Miller       This award supports two-thirds of the cost of  installing
              a network of continuously recording Global  Positioning System (GPS) receivers
              in the state of  Washington for the purpose of measuring ground motion 
              associated with subduction zone tectonics, volcanic  activity, and earthquakes.
              The Principal Investigator will  coordinate the installation and operation of
              the network  from Central Washington University. Central Washington  University
              is committed to providing the remaining funds  necessary for the project. The
              basic research goal of the  measurements to be taken by the network is an
              understanding  of the processes leading to deformation of the continental 
              crust in the Pacific Northwest region due to the combination  of forces from
              the oblique subduction of the Juan de Fuca  plate, the entrainment of the
              Sierra Nevada-Oregon Coast  Range block, and the local forces created by the
              topographic  gradient from the Basin and Range to the Columbia Basin. The 
              network is also expected to provide important data for  improved assessment of
              the seismic and volcanic risk in the  region.  ***
