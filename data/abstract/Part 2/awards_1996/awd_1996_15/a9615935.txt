Abstract    :
                    This project is to participate in a cruise of RV Jan Mayen (University of 
              Troms() which was planned as a joint USA/Norwegian research cruise between
              investigators at the University of Colorado and the University of Troms(,
              Norway.  The Co-Chief Scientists on the cruise will be Hald (Troms() and
              Jennings (Colorado).  The research plan was developed jointly during a
              sabbatical of Hald in Colorado and built upon the reconnaissance marine cruises
              that had been undertaken with INSTAAR leadership in 1991 and 1993.    The
              cruise will take place between Sept. 21 and Oct. 10th, 1996 (Troms( to Troms()
              and will undertake a transect from NW Iceland, across Denmark Strait to the
              East Greenland margin at ca. 68o N (Fig. 1).  The major goal of the cruise is
              to extract sediment cores which will provide information on the extent of the
              Greenland Ice Sheet in the Denmark Strait, and the late Quaternary
              paleoceanography and on ice sheet/ocean interactions across this critical
              "gateway" between the arctic and mid-latitude North Atlantic.  Based on
              existing core data (mainly 1-2 m long gravity cores), and on a detailed
              analysis of 1655 km of seismic tracklines on the E. Greenland shelf,  key
              coring sites have been selected to 1) test potential late Quaternary ice-sheet
              grounding positions on the shelf: and 2) extend our paleoceanographic
              time-frame on the shelf well beyond the 8 to 14 ka basal age limit that we
              encountered previously.  The ability to obtain 10-m cores will potentially
              allow the team to obtain records into Marine Isotope Stage 2/3, depending on
              the glacial history.  The Jan Mayen will be equipped with a piston corer that
              will allow the scientists to obtain 10 m long cores, which will revolutionize
              their ability to extract the information needed to obtain on glacial ice extent
              and icesheet ocean interactions.  Preliminary analyses of the East Greenland
              cores will also be undertaken including visual and x-radiograph core
              descriptions, laser color logging, bulk density measurements, volume and m ass
              magnetic susceptibility, AMS 14C dating of foraminifera and potentially
              molluscs, and coarse resolution foraminiferal biostratigraphy.
