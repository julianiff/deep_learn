Abstract    :
                USC/ISI will create and maintain TRAIL, Testbed Routers for Advanced  Internet
              Labs.  The TRAIL software will be a freely available, well  maintained,
              community research router source, featuring IPv6 in particular.  The work will
              extend and leverage developments and facilities of the  Collaborative Advanced
              Interagency Research Network (CAIRN), organized by  ISI under current DARPA
              funding.  CAIRN is a T1, DS-3 and OC-3 wide area  router testbed.    The
              software is for two classes of hardware: 1) high performance but  low-cost
              personal computers, supporting small numbers of router interfaces  and  2)
              specialized router hardware, supporting the large numbers of  interfaces that
              are characteristic of internet interconnect points, and  providing a realistic
              experimental model of commercial IP routing  technology.    For the second
              class of hardware, one vendor who supports such numbers of  high-speed
              interfaces proved interested in donating full source code to be  used as the
              base of TRAIL.  Therefore, the second class of hardware for  TRAIL is the
              Ascend/Netstar, Gigarouter.  It supports 32 OC-3 ATM ports, or  combinations of
              ATM ports with 16 to 128 fast ethernet ports.    The proposal focuses strongly
              on support of experimental users.  ISI's care  will be devoted to supporting
              their software, and maintaining and  distributing versions for PC alone, and
              for PC along with Gigarouter. ISI  will also maintain facilities for IPv6
              networking research collaboration,  and coordinate the North American portion
              of the experimental IPv6  backbone, the "6bone".
