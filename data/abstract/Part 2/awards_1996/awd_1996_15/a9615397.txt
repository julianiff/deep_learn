Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9615397    Award of $752 to cover round-trip airfare between
              Kansas City and Zurich for Dr. Bala Subramaniam is recommended.  Dr.
              Subramaniam will be presenting a paper on catalysis in supercritical media at
              the Third International Symposium on High Pressure Chemical Engineering on
              October 7.  This paper is based on work initiated in this program and later
              supported by EPSCoR.  This effort is now being supported in the joint NSF/EPA
              program on Technology for a Sustainable Environment.
