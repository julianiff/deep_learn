Abstract    :
              INT-9615213  Gaur   Description:  This proposal will add a collaborative
              component to  a research project in Central Asia that is currently supported by
               the Division of Earth Sciences, Geophysics Program.  It will  activate a new
              collaboration between Roger Bilham of the  University of Colorado and Vinod
              Gaur/ John Paul of the Centre  for Mathematical Modeling, Indian Institute of
              Sciences,  Bangalore.  The researchers have developed a large field program  to
              determine: the shift in latitude of the Indian subcontinent,  the deformation
              in southern India, the rate of convergence of  India and Tibet, and they will
              conduct measurements in Nepal that  will provide a measurement interval for the
              Nepal survey.  Their  measurements will permit characterization of future
              regions of  enhanced seismic potential, establish the rate of growth of the 
              Himalaya, and the recurrence interval for great earthquakes  there.   Scope: 
              The investigators seek funds to support travel to India  and minor expenses to
              supplement field research costs.  This  research will determine the renewal
              time for earthquakes in India  and Nepal and identify regions of potentially
              enhanced seismic  risk in Peninsular India.  Since the destructive Latur
              earthquake  of 1993, there is great urgency to accomplish the goals of this 
              research.      ***
