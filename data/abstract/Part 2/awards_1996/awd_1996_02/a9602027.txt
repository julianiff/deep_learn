Abstract    :
              9602027  Sneed    This Americas Program award will fund a cooperative research 
              program and workshop between  Joseph Sneed, Colorado School  of Mines, and
              Frederick W. Lange, University of Colorado,  Boulder, and Mario
              Molina-Carrillo, Instituto Nicaraguense  de Cultura, Nicaragua, and Maria E.
              Murillo, Direccion  General de Museos, Costa Rica.  The objective is to 
              establish the initial foundation for an internet based,  multimedia information
              system for selected museum and  university archaeology and cultural ecology
              collections in  Central America.  The focus of the project is the 
              archaeological and ecological material in museum  collections, and the closely
              allied concerns of cultural  patrimony protection and intellectual property.   
              In cooperation with Costa Rican and Nicaraguan cultural  institutions, this
              system will serve educators and the  general public.  It would be used
              extensively by scholars  and students in the U.S., especially in institutions
              that  emphasize Latin American anthropology and  will provide a  paradigm for
              international cooperation in the production and  maintenance of internet based
              information systems in other  academic disciplines and regions.    ***
