Abstract    :
              9602990  VanOrden    This U.S.-Mexico Planning Visit will provide travel support
               to Drs. Ann C. VanOrden and Desmond C. Cook, of Old Dominion  University, so
              that they may make research planning, site  inspection and coupon exposure
              trips to the Yucatan  Peninsula, Mexico.  They wish to plan a research proposal
              in  corrosion research with Drs. Juan J. Carpio and Luis  Maldonado Lopez of
              the Universidad Autonoma de Campeche.    The objective of this research is to
              use highly accurate  instrumentation to determine the chemistry and 
              crystallography of the oxide phase found in corrosion  products formed in
              differing environments, and to correlate  the corrosion products and corrosion
              rates with the  environmental parameters available from the atmospheric 
              monitoring of the sites.  This planning visit will allow the  investigators on
              both sides to finalize research plans and  to evaluate the designated sites,
              which present some very  harsh atmospheric exposure conditions.  ***
