Abstract    :
              9602925  Glass    This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative 
              research project between Drs. Richard Glass, University of  Arizona, Tucson,
              and Eusebio Juaristi, I.P.N., Mexico.  The  research aims to develop new
              methods for synthesis of  glycosides by generating sugar oxocarbenium ions
              under mild  and neutral oxidizing conditions. The use of this reaction  for the
              formation of glycosides, nucleosides, and C-  glycosides will be investigated
              to ascertain the  conformational behavior of the glycosides and related 
              compounds.  Model compounds will be used in a systematic  study of the
              feasibility of the method, and on the tolerance  to neighboring substituents.  
               This is an area of considerable current research interest  and, if successful,
              the study may generate useful methods  for saccharide and nucleoside chemistry
              of potential  application to the development of new therapeutic agents.  For
              this project, the synthesis of the iron complexes and  their redox chemistry
              will be done in Arizona, and their  conformational analysis and synthesis of
              selected precursors  of the Fp sugars will be carried out in Mexico.  ***
