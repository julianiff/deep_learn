Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to show that quantum systems can be chaotic, which is
              thought not to  be possible because a system undergoing unitary time evolution
              is not sensitive to its initial  conditions, and sensitivity to initial
              conditions is an indicator of chaos.   If quantum systems are  not chaotic,
              then the correspondence principle is challenged.  (The correspondence principle
              is a  main interpretive principle of qunatum mechanics, which asserts that as
              the scale of a system  increases, quantum physics converges on conventional
              physics).   The key to accomplishing this  aim is to examine a pair of
              interacting systems, because a component of a pair of such systems  does not,
              in general, undergo unitary time evolution, leaving open the possibility of
              finding chaos  in the time evolution of a component of such a pair.  If it can
              be shown that quantum systems do  indeed exhibit chaos, then the correspondence
              principle would be vindicated.
