Abstract    :
              This award supports a new, multidisciplinary  research training program focused
              on understanding  the biological implications of small population  size.  A
              group of 18 faculty from the Departments of  Zoology, Plant Biology and
              Entomology at the  University of Maryland have joined with 5 colleagues  from
              research units of the Smithsonian Institution  to develop a novel training
              program for  undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students  that integrates
              studies of  population and community  ecology, genetics, evolution, and social
              behavior in  the context of small populations.  Because small,  reproductively
              isolated populations are an  increasingly common feature of the natural 
              distribution of many wild plants and animals, such  studies will both provide
              important understanding of  basic processes in biology and, at the same time, 
              lead to knowledge useful in conservation biology and  in the preservation of
              wild and captive endangered  species.  Undergraduate trainees will pursue a
              year-  long research project and participate in seminars,  journal clubs and
              technical workshops aimed at all  trainee levels.  Graduate students will
              follow a  core curriculum of existing and new courses  developed for the RTG,
              as well as a required year-  long focused seminar leading to an intensive 3-day
               annual meeting.  During the meeting, leading experts  will meet in lecture and
              discussion with the  trainees.  The technical workshops and optional  summer
              research internships will benefit from  Smithsonian Institution laboratories
              and field  research sites.  A novel feature of required  training will be a
              course on race, gender and  scientific knowledge taught by one of the RTG 
              faculty.  Graduate and postdoctoral research  projects will emphasize
              integration of multiple  disciplines and are expected to benefit from the 
              participation of two faculty mentors.  ***
