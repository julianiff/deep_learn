Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Boston University will purchase remote
              sensing instrumentation for use by the Archaeology Department. The equipment
              includes: 1. a Geometrics Model G-868 Cesium Magnetometer with a sensitivity of
              (.05 to .01 nT and measurement rates from 10 to 1 per second). The machine has
              an internal memory for storage of 250,0000 measurement points and runs a full
              day on a rechargeable battery pack; 2. a Geoscan Research Resistance Survey
              System RM-15. This electrical resistivity meter with Geoplot Software is fully
              automated for rapid survey and wide-area coverage. Rechargeable batteries will
              also power the unit for a full day; 3. a Dell latitude LX 4100D portable
              notebook computer and printer suitable for in field processing and temporary
              storage of geophysical survey data. The portable printer will serve to print
              maps in the field for use by survey crews.  Archaeological excavation is time
              consuming, expensive and destructive by its very nature. Remote sensing
              techniques permit archaeologists to, in effect, look below the ground to locate
              magnetic and other anomalies and to plot their location and sometimes shape.
              These can reflect the presence of buildings, hearths, pits and other features.
              The results can guide placement of archaeological trenches to make best use of
              limited time and resources. Boston University is a leader in remote sensing and
              its very active Archaeology Department conducts excavations in many parts of
              the world. It's current equipment is approximately a decade old and requires
              replacement by more accurate, faster and more reliable models. This award
              accomplishes that goal. The department also provides training in remote sensing
              techniques, available no place else in the United States, to numbers of both
              graduate and undergraduate students.   Currently Boston University researchers
              are pursuing a number of projects. The most anthropologically relevant of these
              include underground mapping of the ancient capital of Narvin in northern
              Ireland and survey of K'xabo, a Mayan site in Belize.
