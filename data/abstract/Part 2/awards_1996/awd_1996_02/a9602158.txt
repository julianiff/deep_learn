Abstract    :
              This project will organize and conduct a series of three workshops in Russia on
              engineering ethics.  For Russian educators and scholars, the project will
              assist in developing materials and strategies for incorporating ethics
              instruction into engineering education.  For U.S. participants, it will be an
              opportunity to reassess methods and content in engineering ethics curricula. 
              Russian engineers, accommodating to changes in the economy, democratization,
              and restructuring of institutions, confront new issues of professional ethics
              and social responsibility:  concerns for public safety and problematic
              technologies, issues of intellectual property, and development of ethical and
              technical standards.  Engineering ethics education is of assistance in
              confronting these issues, and a small but growing network of Russians are
              interested in collaborating with their U.S. counterparts to foster research and
              teaching in this field.  Prominent U.S. scientific and engineering societies
              along with several accomplished scholars and educators are participating in
              this joint effort.  The workshops will combine plenary sessions and small,
              interactive discussion groups.  A joint committee of Russian and U.S. educators
              and scholars will develop the agendas and choose the literature for translation
              for use at the workshops.  An instructional module composed of that literature
              and case studies, some of which will be produced as part of the workshops, will
              be prepared for Russian use.
