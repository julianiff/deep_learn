Abstract    :
                  9602514  Rudder    The Ralph Bunche Summer Institute brings together African
              American  college juniors with a view toward encouraging them to go to 
              graduate school in political science.  Approximately 20-25 African  American
              college juniors are selected in a national competition  administered by the
              American Political Science Association.  The  students participate in a
              five-week, for-credit Institute which  includes graduate level courses,
              lectures from distinguished  visiting professors, coaching on the Graduate
              Record Examinations,  informal sessions on applying to graduate school, and
              visitis from  leading graduate institution recruiters.    The grant from the
              National Science Foundation will considerably  enhance the chances for a
              successful summer institute.  ***
