Abstract    :
              9602928  Oseroff      This U.S.-Brazil award will support collaborative research
               between Dr. Saul Oseroff of San Diego State University and  Dr. Carlos Rettori
              of Universidade Estadual de Campinas -  UNICAMP in the study of heavy fermion
              systems, intermediate  valence compounds and materials showing an unusually
              large  magnetoresistance. The experiments planned will address  specific
              questions essential to the understanding of the  physics of strongly correlated
              systems.  Electron spin  resonance, magnetization and Raman techniques will be
              used  to study high quality single crystals of those systems.    In addition to
              shedding light on the issue of the  microscopic description of heavy fermion
              physics, successful  results of these experiments will lead to the ability to 
              manipulate strong correlation effects for useful means  especially in the areas
              of electronic and thermal devices.    ***
