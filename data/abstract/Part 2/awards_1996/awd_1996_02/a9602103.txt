Abstract    :
              INT 9602103  Herman        This U.S.-Hungary workshop on discrete tomography is
              jointly organized by Dr. Gabor Herman of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr.
              Attila Kuba of Jozsef Attila University.  The workshop will be held in Szeged,
              Hungary, during August 25-27, 1997, and is intended to bring together
              Hungarians researchers with strong fundamental mathematical expertise and U.S.
              counterparts who excel in more applied research.  Five participants from other
              counties are also invited to attend, at their own expense.    The objective of
              this workshop is to pursue problems of discrete tomography, where the domain
              may be discrete, or continuous, and there exists an unknown function f whose
              range is known to be a given discrete set.  Discussions will feature problems
              where we know the discrete range of f, thus allowing us to determine its value
              at points where without this knowledge it could not be determined.  Such
              questions are relevant to solutions that may be applicable to electron
              microscopy and nondestructive testing.    This workshop on number theory
              pertaining to discrete tomography fulfills the program objective of advancing
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of
              strong mutual interest and competence.     ??
