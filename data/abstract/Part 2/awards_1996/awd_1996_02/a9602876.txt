Abstract    :
              9602876  Tolbert    This award supports the participation of 10 U.S. academic 
              participants in a U.S.-Japan seminar on New Aspects of  Photoresponsive
              Materials, to be held at the Catalina Island  Conference Center, California,
              from November 4-8, 1996. The  co-organizers are Professors Laren Tolbert and
              Gary Schuster  of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta and Professor 
              Masahiro Irie of Kyushu University.  The theme of the  proposed seminar was
              chosen in order to highlight recent  advances in the use of light to bring
              about changes in the  properties of materials.  Such materials may be used in 
              optoelectronic devices, such as imaging, memory, and display  devices, as well
              as so-called "smart" materials which mimic  the light-driven responses of
              living systems.  These include  changes in color ("photochromics") as well as
              changes  leading to actual motion ("optomechanics").  Of course, the  ultimate
              light-driven biological response is photosynthesis,  and this represents a
              continuing focus of activity in both  countries.  Fundamental discoveries in
              each of these areas  are being made both in U.S. and in Japan, and increased 
              exchange of ideas and information between these two groups  is clearly
              essential to maintaining a high level of  intellectual output.  The U.S.
              participants provide a broad  cross section of expertise and geographical
              representation  in the area of photochemistry, photophysics, and materials 
              science, and were selected on the basis of being the most  active researchers
              in the U. S. while providing a diverse  range of interests. Therefore, this
              proposal fulfills the  objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer
              of  scientific knowledge through international collaboration.  ***
