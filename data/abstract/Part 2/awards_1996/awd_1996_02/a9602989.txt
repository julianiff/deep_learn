Abstract    :
              9602989  Micha    This Americas Program award will fund travel and related 
              expenses for 15 U.S. and Latin American research scientists  and advanced
              doctoral students to participate in a workshop  on recent developments in the
              theoretical and computational  aspects of molecular and materials sciences. The
              workshop,  organized by Dr. David Micha, University of Florida with the 
              collaboration of senior scientists of several Latin American  institutions,
              will take place at the campus of the  University of Florida, on February 27 and
              28, 1997.  The  purpose is to promote scientific contacts between scientists 
              in the U.S. and Latin America, aimed at developing  theoretical and
              computational methods applicable to problems  of common interest in  these
              sciences.    Materials science is a priority area both for this country  and
              throughout  the hemisphere, and the topics to be  discussed will address new
              methods to interpret data and to  predict phenomena in several areas of
              theoretical chemistry.  A book of the proceedings abstracts, including a
              summary of  discussion comments on present needs and expected future  trends,
              will be made available to scientists.  ***
