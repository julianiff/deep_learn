Abstract    :
              9602960  Gubbins    This Americas Program award will support a collaborative 
              research project between Dr. Keith E. Gubbins, Cornell  University and Dr.
              Erich Mueller, Universidad  Simon  Bolivar, Caracas, Venezuela.   They will
              study the  equilibrium and dynamic behavior of water and aqueous  solutions
              when confined within the narrow pores of activated  carbons. The objectives of
              the work are to determine the  effects of confinement on the adsorption
              behavior of pure  water, water/hydrocarbon and water/carboxilyc acid mixtures, 
              and investigate the dynamic behavior and diffusion rates in  the pores. 
              Methods to be used will include Grand Canonical  Monte Carlo and equilibrium
              and  nonequilibrium Molecular  Dynamics simulation.  Comparisons of results
              from both  methods will clarify the poorly understood confinement  effects in
              these systems.    A general aim of this research is to suggest new and optimal 
              designs for adsorbents and adsorption processes for use in  the oil and
              petrochemical industry, and for the removal of  pollutants from air and water
              streams.    ***
