Abstract    :
              9602977  Vinning-Brown-    Status differences significantly influence social
              interactions by limiting the opportunities of individuals holding lower status
              positions.   This proposal seeks  to examine the "gender climate" in two
              top-ranked undergraduate engineering programs.  The project will collect data
              on educational process and outcomes, examine factors and relationship affecting
              climate, test interventions to reform classroom and department environments;
              and develop support systems to attract, retain, and enlarge a pool of
              professional women in engineering.    It focuses attention on race and gender
              by examining structural and individual factors that produce variations in
              satisfaction among minority and white women, explores the perceptions and
              experiences of women in engineering, and examines the connection between
              department and classroom climate concerns.      This project will track
              student's persistence in engineering to determine the extent to which climate
              concerns are related to dropping out or switching fields.  It will use both
              survey and interview techniques.  The project will involve the University of
              Maryland College Park, the Georgia Institute of Technology and feeder
              institutions to those universities.    Students, chairs, deans, and department
              heads will be interviewed.    ***
