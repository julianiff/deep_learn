Abstract    :
              9602886  Kron    The abundance of morphological and molecular evidence to date 
              consistently indicates that a new classification of the Ericaceae  - an
              ecologically and horticulturally important group which  includes, for example,
              azaleas, blueberries, and cranberries - is  needed.  This workshop, organized
              by Professor Kathleen A. Kron  of the Department of Biology, Wake Forest
              University, and Dr.  Paul A. Gadek of the Department of Botany and Tropical 
              Agriculture, James Cook University of North Queensland,  Australia, will
              provide a forum for the development of a new and  modern(cladistic)
              classification based on all of the newly  available evidence developed in the
              United States and in  Australia.  Classification of this nearly cosmopolitan
              group of  plants is important because it provides a reference point for  many
              areas of research such as the study of molecular evolution  and the
              investigation of mycorrhizal associations in Epacridaceae  and Ericaceae. The
              workshop will provide opportunities for  Australian, US, and Swedish
              researchers to exchange information  and develop new collaborative projects. 
              In particular,  collaborations on evolutionary and biogeographical questions 
              within the southern hemisphere and Asian taxa will be pursued.
