Abstract    :
                  9602190  Hughes  The long term goal of this proposal is to thoroughly
              understand the regulatory mechanisms controlling the biosynthesis of the
              essential amino acid, methionine, in plants, especially soybean that has a low
              methionine content.  This knowledge may enable us to determine how to alter
              these regulatory mechanisms to develop nutritionally improved plants that
              produce increased levels of methionine.     The major goals are focussed on an
              important enzyme involved in methionine biosynthesis, cystationine
              gamma-synthase (CS), and its gene and/or gene family in soybean.  CS is the
              branch point enzyme leading to methionine production from aspartate.  In order,
              to understand the molecular and metabolic mechanisms that regulate methionine
              systhesis, the following specific aims will be addressed:      I. What is the
              role of cystathionine gamma-synthase    in methionine systhesis?   II. What
              regulates the expression of the gene encoding   cystathionine gamma-synthase?  
               Plants are the major source of dietary proteins for umans and livestock.  The
              essential amino acid content of these dietary proteins is very important
              because these amino acids are necessary to ensure proper growth in humans and
              livestock that are unable to synthesize them.  Therefore, these amino acids are
              usually supplemented into their diets.
