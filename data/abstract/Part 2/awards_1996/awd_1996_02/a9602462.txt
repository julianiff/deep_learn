Abstract    :
              9602462  Capone    This award provides support for a 3 month National Science 
              Foundation Dissertation Enhancement Award for Douglas Capone  at Tokai
              University, School of Marine Science and  Technology.  Dr. Capone's student,
              Ms. Margaret Mulholland  will work with Dr. Kaori Ohki, Professor in the School
              of  Marine Science and Technology, on a research project  entitled, "Regulation
              of N2 fixation in Trichodesmium".    Trichodesmium spp. are N2 fixing, marine
              cyanobacteria that  occur throughout the tropical and subtropical oceans in 
              areas otherwise noted for their paucity of plant life.  As  for many
              terrestrial systems, limitation of oceanic plant  production is attributed
              primarily to a shortage of  utilizable nitrogen compounds.  Trichodesmium spp.,
              utilize  dinitrogen gas,  the most abundant form of nitrogen, thereby 
              alleviating nitrogen limitation and providing new nitrogen  input into these
              systems. Trichodesmium spp. can sustain  high rates of N2 fixation in nature;
              however, little is  known about the biochemical and physiological conditions 
              that support N2 fixation in these species since they have  been difficult to
              maintain in controlled culture systems.  Professor Ohki and her collaborators
              have been successful in  their attempts to grow Trichodesmium in cultures,but 
              transfer of this culture to other laboratories has proven  unsuccessful.  This
              project will examine the cellular  regulation of N metabolism and N2 fixation
              in Trichodesmium  NIBB1067 grown under controlled conditions with and without 
              fixed nitrogen compounds.  Results from these studies will  be compared with
              results from the field in order to better  understand the natural populations
              of Trichodesmium.  ***
