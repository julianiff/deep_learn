Abstract    :
              9602479  Kangari  Cooperative research will be conducted with professor Yuri 
              Villman at Robotics Lab in Moscow State University of Civil  Engineering,
              Moscow, Russia, on robotics in construction and  environmental restoration
              operations.  This study will be  focused on analyses of the feasibility of
              telerobotic and  autonomous systems in construction and hazardous  environment.
               The robotics center at Moscow State University  has focused on comparing
              traditional, human operated systems  with telerobotic and autonomous systems in
              environmental  applications to determine the feasible uses of automated 
              equipment in construction, mining, and environmental  cleanups.
