Abstract    :
              9602935  Fauchet    This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative 
              research project between Dr. Philippe Fauchet, University of  Rochester, and 
              Dr. Julia Taguena, Universidad Nacional  Autonoma de Mexico.  The objective is
              to investigate,  theoretically and experimentally, the properties and device 
              applications of silicon/polymer nanocomposites.  Theoretical  methods developed
              by the Mexican side to predict the  electronic and optical properties of
              multiphase materials  within an effective medium framework will be applied to 
              silicon/polymer nanocomposites.  Using porous silicon as the  starting
              material, optical and transport measurements will  be performed by the U.S.
              side on the nanocomposites to  ensure a close fit between the theoretical
              calculations and  the experimental results.    Composites form a
              recently-developed class of materials with  unusual optical properties.  The
              modeling and production of  such nanocomposites  provide many opportunities for
               materials and devices with enhanced properties that may find  application in
              optoelectronic devices.  ***
