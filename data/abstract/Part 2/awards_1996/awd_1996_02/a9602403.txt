Abstract    :
               In response to local needs, Edmonds Community College proposes a 42-month
              curriculum development/pilot project impacting ca 250 participants. It 1)
              reconfigure the 12.5-credit laboratories for general and organic chemistry as
              project-based modules and 2) creates a new ChemCore curriculum, part of a
              combined Associate of Technical Arts/Associate of Arts and Sciences Laboratory
              Technician program. Developed in close cooperation with government and industry
              through an advisory board, ChemCore would integrate the lab chemistry with 5
              new applied academics courses, 25 credits in all: instrumental analysis,
              information technology, management, and tech writing/applied communications
              (2). The project would also introduce a new laboratory setting simulating the
              tasks, customer requests, on-the-job skills training, and working conditions of
              a commercial laboratory performing chemical analyses; create a series of
              increasingly sophisticated and open-ended requests for services to replace
              traditional laboratory exercises; and use outside professionals offering
              demonstrations and related instruction.   The project targets high school
              recruits, pre-professional science and engineering, Work Force Training, and
              other vocational students, with special efforts to enroll women and students of
              color. Its principal goals and objectives are to 1) develop an up-to-date,
              interdisciplinary, transferable laboratory curriculum at EdCC; 2) attract
              additional chemistry students, especially from underrepresented populations,
              through the appeal of applied chemistry in real-world situations; 3) prepare
              students in a 2-year program with the interdisciplinary knowledge, skills, and
              experience required for full-time employment as lab technicians and/or
              part-time jobs while they pursue further study; and 4) if the project is
              successful, submit ChemCore and the technician program design to the NSF-funded
              Northwest Center for Emerging Technologies for approval as a model Associated
              of Advanced Technology degree program.
