Abstract    :
              9602143  PI:  Sur  The long term objective of this project is  to elucidate the
              mechanisms by which the activity of developing nerve cells   during embryonic
              development influences the patterns of connections in the brain  to generate a
              functioning system.  It is postulated that the mechanisms involved in
              development may be similar to those known to play a part in regulating the
              plasticity  of  connections of the mature brain.  The proposed experiments
              address the role of nitric oxide, a substance recently shown to play  a part in
              the transfer of signals from one nerve cell to another,  in  regulating the
              establishment of synapses (the structures through  which nerve cells in the
              brain communicate).  It has previously been demonstrated that substances that
              block the  normal function of the relevant synapses, also prevent the normal
              development of the visual  processing region of the brain. This may be effected
              through changes in the permeability of the cells to calcium ions.  The overall
              outcome of these experimented will be  to provide a fuller explanation of  how
              orderly  patterns of nerve connections develop in the brain.
