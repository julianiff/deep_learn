Abstract    :
              9602921  Boerner      This Americas Program award will fund travel and related 
              expenses for a dissertation research project by  Kelly L.  Decker, Ohio State
              University, under the direction of Dr.  Ralph Boerner, and in collaboration
              with Dr. Maria F. Hevia  Hott, University of Concepcion,  Chillan, Chile.  They
              will  investigate various traits associated with contrasting leaf  habits
              (deciduous vs. evergreen) in temperate southern  hemisphere forests. 
              Specifically, the study will address  the adaptive advantage of an increased
              life span by focusing  on ecophysiological traits and relative competitive
              ability  of evergreen and deciduous species of Nothofagus (southern  beech).   
              Leaf lifespan is an important ecological issue at present.  The Nothofagus
              mixed deciduous forest system of central  Chile provides an excellent
              opportunity to study the  relative adaptive advantage of differing leaf
              lifespans  because of the presence of pure Nothofagus canopies  containing both
              deciduous and evergreen species.  Thus, this  forest system offers an
              interesting model for understanding  the evolution and potential adaptive
              significance of  contrasting leaf traits.  ***
