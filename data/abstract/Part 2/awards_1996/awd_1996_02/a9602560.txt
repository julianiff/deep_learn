Abstract    :
                The St. Croix Watershed Research Station (SCWRS) is the  biological field
              station of  the Science Museum of Minnesota  (SMM).  The lands and facilities
              of the SCWRS are located  within St. Croix National Scenic Riverway at the
              boundary  between Minnesota and Wisconsin. The SCWRS provides  opportunities to
              conduct research on a large midcontinental  river system and associated
              habitats.    The SCWRS was established in 1989 and has greatly expanded  its
              physical facilities, staffing, and research activity in  the intervening six
              years.  Following a strategic planning  effort, a modern 6200 ft2 Research
              Center and year-round  housing facility for visiting scientists were completed
              in  1995. In 1995-96 the SCWRS expanded its permanent research  staff to create
              a core research program focusing on  landscape-level problems in land-water
              interaction. A total  of 35 separate visiting research programs have been 
              supported at the SCWRS over the past six field seasons,  including several
              major projects dealing ecological problems  of national and global
              significance.    This project is a direct outgrowth of the recent expansion  of
              SCWRS physical facilities and the immediate need to  acquire key pieces of
              analytical equipment to support  current and pending research initiatives.
              Support is  requested for three major acquisitions: (1) an automated ion 
              analyzer for measuring phosphorus, nitrogen, and silica in  water, and solids;
              and (3) research-grade stereo-and  compound microscopes.  These instruments
              will greatly  improve SCWRS's analytical capabilities for measurement  of
              biological and biogeochemical components of aquatic  systems.
