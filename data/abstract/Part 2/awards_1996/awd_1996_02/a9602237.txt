Abstract    :
              9602237  This award will provides renewed support to a Research  Training Group
              in Cytoskeleton Biology at the University of  Minnesota.  Support will be
              phased out gradually during the  tenure of the award as other sources of
              funding are secured.  The faculty group includes members of the departments of 
              Cell Biology and Neuroanatomy, Genetics and Cell Biology,  Biochemistry, and
              Plant Biology.  The funds awarded will  provide stipends for graduate students
              and postdoctoral  trainees, will support research participation by 
              undergraduates, and will defray part of the cost of the  trainees' research. 
              In addition, funds will be used to  purchase specialized research equipment to
              be used by  trainees and to bring investigators from other research and 
              academic institutions to the campus for seminars .  The cytoplasm of all
              eukaryotic cells contains a dynamic,  fibrous network of actin filaments,
              microtubules and  intermediate filaments that participate in virtually every 
              aspect of cellular form and function.  Because of the  ubiquity of the network
              and its role in cellular processes  as diverse as gene expression, cell
              replication, cell  division, and cell movement, studies of the cytoskeleton 
              provide an excellent focus for multidisciplinary training in  at the forefront
              of modern biology.
