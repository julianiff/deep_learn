Abstract    :
              9602209  Austin  This study examines informal strategies of maintaining social
              order in ethnically complex (Muslim-Christian) Philippine municipalities in the
              province of Lanao del Norte on the southern island of Mindanao Although
              international attention has focused on the unstable nature of Muslin-Christian
              regions around the world, few researchers have addressed the distinct
              peacekeeping networks which appear to have at least relative success even in
              ethnically diverse Philippine communities.  The P.I. will analyze the variety
              of Muslim-Christian disputes and grievances in the region and will clarify the
              varied peace-making styles which have emerged at the neighborhood and village
              levels Particular focus will be given to the manner in which citizen volunteers
              have mobilized in an effort to maintain peace and order even in the comparative
              absence of official police and government social control agencies. Special
              attention will be paid to the role played by the intermediary (bilingual fixer)
              who is traditionally sought out to intervene between rival Muslim--Christian
              groups. Data for the project will come from in-depth interviews with community
              leaders (priests, Islamic dates, village captains, police and court officials
              and educators, among others.  Analyzing the non-violent, peacemaking mechanisms
              appearing in the Muslim--Christian communities and the social context in which
              they succeed or fail will provide valuable information to researchers and
              policy makers in other world areas experiencing political-religious discord.
