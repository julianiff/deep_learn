Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to examine the evolutionary genetics of a pair of New World
              primates, the  mantled howler monkey and the black howler monkey ( A.
              palliata). The goals of this study  include a reconstruction of the ancient
              invasion of Central America by howler monkeys and, as a  secondary objective, a
              genetic analysis of social structure in a well-studied population of  mantled
              howlers.  A SGER grant is requested here to support a preliminary survey of
              genetic  variation in mantled and black howler monkeys that will demonstrate
              the feasibility of this  study.  This study will significantly augment our
              understanding of primate evolutionary dynamics in  two ways:  (1) The results
              of this study will provide a preliminary model for the population  genetics of
              Central American primates.  (2) The information generated by this preliminary
              study  about New World primate genetics will also contribute to future
              ecological and evolutionary  studies in this group.
