Abstract    :
                This project will upgrade instrumentation in the Trace  Metals Laboratory at
              Moss Landing Marine Laboratories.  The  Trace Metals Lab of MLML has been a
              world leader in studies  of the role of metals in regulating primary production
              in  the ocean over large spatial and temporal scales.  Moss  Landing scientists
              have played a major part in developing  new analytical methods for trace
              elements in aquatic  systems.  They have also played a key role in making 
              freshwater chemists aware that there are significant  methodological errors in
              previous measurements of metals in  freshwater systems.  As a result, MLML has
              served as an  important center for training and development of analytical 
              methods for trace chemical analysis.  In the past 5 years,6  graduate students
              have finished MS degrees working with  Trace Metals Lab staff and
              instrumentation.  In addition,  there have been a number of visitors to the lab
              from the US  and overseas.
