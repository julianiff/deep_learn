Abstract    :
              Title:  Environmental Transportation Technology     In response to environmental
              concerns and nation's dependence on foreign produced oil, government mandates
              have forced the transportation industry to identify, develop, and employ
              alternatives to the internal combustion engine.  At the same time, the
              development of new fuels and technologies has outpaced the supply of adequately
              educated technicians to satisfy industry demand.  Traditionally, transportation
              technicians have been trained in short term programs, but these programs are no
              longer adequate since the new technologies require a different core of
              knowledge.  This project is developing a new 11 - 14 program leading to as
              associate degree in environmental transportation technology with particular
              emphasis on new curriculum in technical areas in gaseous fuels technology
              combined with a broad general education component in science, information
              science, communications, mathematics, and applied physics.  Participating
              directly with College of the Desert to create and test this new program are
              three other community colleges in California (San Diego Mirimar, Alameda, and
              Rio Hondo). These institutions are joined in this effort by five other
              California community colleges who form the Advanced Transportation Technology
              Initiative, the Desert Tech Prep Consortium, the American Society of Advanced
              Fuels Technology, and numerous industrial and government partners.  Workshops
              for two-year college faculty and secondary school teachers are being conducted
              to develop expertise in this new curriculum.
