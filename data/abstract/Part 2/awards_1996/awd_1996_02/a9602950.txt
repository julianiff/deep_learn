Abstract    :
              9602950  Heil    This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative  research
              project between Drs. Wolfgang Heil, Florida State  University, and Carlos
              Gomez-Larranaga and Victor Nunez, of  the Centro de Investigaciones Matematicas
              (CIMAT), Mexico,  to study non-orientable 3- manifolds.  A 3-dimensional 
              manifold is a particular topological space that locally  looks like standard
              3-dimensional Euclidean space.  The  theory of 3-dimensional manifolds splits
              such manifolds into  two subclasses: orientable and non-orientable manifolds. 
              Of  the two subclasses, the non-orientable have a uniquely  different behavior
              and possibly a richer structure than the  orientable.   To understand this
              structure, the  investigators intend to study decompositions of such  manifolds
              into orientable pieces and associate with these  decompositions an ordered
              triple of numbers, the trigenus,  that may provide a useful approach to their
              classification.    The mathematicians involved in the collaboration have been 
              at the forefront of advancing the trigenus concept; support  for this work will
              allow them to apply it to a wider class  of 3-manifolds and obtain new results
              in this area.  ***
