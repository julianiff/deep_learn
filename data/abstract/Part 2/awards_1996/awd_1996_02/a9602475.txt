Abstract    :
              9602475  Frankel  This proposal for a workshop  is to bring together workers in
              the rapidly changing field of mouse molecular neurogenetics.  The emphasis will
              be on developmental mechanisms, and will bring together workers experienced in
              the field, new researchers, and students.   The laboratory mouse is one of the
              premier experimental animals for molecular   studies of the processes of neural
              development .  This will be the second  such biennial meeting and will provide
              the latest information concerning targeted mutation,  genetic fine-mapping,
              positional cloning, quantitative trait analysis, and sequencing  and expression
              of cloned genes.
