Abstract    :
              9602576  Scholin    This objectives of this collaborative research project
              between  Christopher A. Scholin of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research 
              Institute and Lesley L. Rhodes of the Cawthorn Institute in  Nelson, New
              Zealand are (1) to determine whether the dipstick  assay incorporating
              large-subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU rRNA)-  targeted probes is a viable method for
              identifying and  quantifying toxigenic species of Pseudo-nitzschia associated
              with  the production of domoic acid (DA), a neurotoxic substance linked  to
              illness of humans and wildlife (amnesic shellfish poisoning)  and to economic
              losses,  (2) to compare the performance of the  dipstick assay to a
              microscopy-based whole cell fluorescence  assay, and (3) to assess the utility
              of the method for routine  analyses of samples collected as part of the New
              Zealand  shellfish biotoxin monitoring program. The results will serve as  a
              model for how one might detect other aquatic-borne toxic micro  organisms in
              near real-time using DNA probes.
