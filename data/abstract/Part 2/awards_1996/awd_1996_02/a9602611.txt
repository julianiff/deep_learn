Abstract    :
                This award will provide partial support  for the creation of a Plasma
              Spectroscopy Laboratory for the College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences
              (COAS) at Oregon State University, recognized as one of the ten major -JOI+
              oceanographic institutions.  Three outdated, interconnected laboratories in
              Burt Hall will be renovated to provide integrated management and sample
              preparation for an existing emission plasma spectrometer and two existing
              atomic absorption instruments.  An adjoining laboratory will be converted into
              an electronics shop and clean room.  Current laboratories are not suitable for
              the low level work conducted in the facility.  Renovations will include:
              remodeling space, refurbishing existing cabinets and counters, replacing
              corroded metal sinks and fixtures, and installing new ductwork, fume hoods and
              air conditioning units.  To make the facility safe and more cost-effective to
              operate, an uninterrupted power supply and a central recirculating water
              chiller will be included.  This project will elevate the quality of science
              produced by  reducing the possibility of contamination, and guaranteeing the
              integrity of samples during sample preparation and analysis. Research training
              for students will be enhanced, as well as accommodating more students, faculty
              and visiting scientists conducting research in the facility.
