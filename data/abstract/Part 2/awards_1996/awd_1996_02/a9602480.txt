Abstract    :
              There are an estimated 500,000 Alu repetitive DNA elements in the genome
              (chromosomes) of  humans and other primate species. Most of the repeats have
              arisen in the evolutionary past (some  10 to 20 million years ago), others are
              still arising at new genomic sites; thus their total number  keeps increasing.
              It is important to understand the mode of spreading of these Alu elements. The 
              objective of this proposal is to establish if, and to what extent, Alu repeats
              are fixed or transient  (polymorphic) in our genome; whether they arise in
              reversible or irreversible mechanisms.   Polymorphism greatly complicates
              genetic analyses by blurring the distinction between meaningful  and
              meaningless changes. The fixed or polymorphic state of a character is
              impossible to predict, it  has to be established by analyzing large numbers of
              individuals. If the mode by which Alu repeats   spread can be established as
              being irreversible, Alu's can be viewed as solid landmarks in the  evolutionary
              dynamics of our genome and will become invaluable tools for phylogenetic
              analyses.
