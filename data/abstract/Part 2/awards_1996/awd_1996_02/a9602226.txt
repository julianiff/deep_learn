Abstract    :
              This award supports a new, multidisciplinary research  training program focused
              on understanding nonlinear  processes in biological systems at the level of
              cells to  that of  populations and communities.  A group of 25 faculty  from
              eight departments at the University of California at  Davis will train
              undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral  students with backgrounds in
              mathematics or biology in non-  linear mathematical methods suited to the
              analysis of a  variety of biological problems.  Graduate students will be 
              required to complete a set of core courses in mathematics,  and additional
              training in laboratory or fieldwork-based  biology, depending on individual
              backgrounds.  Laboratory  rotations will be required as will participation in a
              year-  long group research project involving trainees at all  levels.  Graduate
              students will then complete a  multidisciplinary thesis research project under
              the guidance  of two mentors in one of three general research areas:  Cellular,
              Biofluid or Population Dynamics.  In its overall  approach, the program will
              emphasize collaborative research  and mentoring by faculty and by graduate and
              postdoctoral  students within and across training levels.
