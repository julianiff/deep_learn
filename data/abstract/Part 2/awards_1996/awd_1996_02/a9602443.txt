Abstract    :
              Chicago Chemical Laboratory Technology Education Partnership    Truman College,
              one of the City Colleges of Chicago, is establishing a partnership of secondary
              schools, community colleges, universities, and industries that focuses on
              Chemical Laboratory Technology education with an emphasis on such education for
              minority students.  The project is:  (a) coordinating the chemistry curricula
              of secondary schools, community colleges and universities in Chicago, (b)
              recruiting students from the secondary and community college level into the
              program, (c) providing chemical technology enhancement opportunities for
              secondary school teachers and community college faculty, (d) developing
              curriculum for advanced Chemical Laboratory Technology education, in particular
              a course in instrumental analysis, and (e) integrating the program with Chicago
              area industries and professional societies. This project is creating an urban
              model for advanced technology programs, addressing both the unique problems of
              inner city students, and their preparation for entry into high tech careers.
