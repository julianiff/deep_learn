Abstract    :
              This research extends traditional public goods theory by examining the
              connectivity and communality properties of communication and information-based
              public goods. The study is a longitudinal examination of a communication and
              information-based public good, specifically, a large interorganizational
              computer-supported collaborative work system.  The type of collective action
              involved in providing communication and information public goods is theorized
              to possess two properties that are uniquely important to communication forms of
              collective goods:  connectivity and communality.  A synthesis of the economic
              theories of contribution games and the sociological framework offered by
              Marwell and Oliver provides a model that considers both individual actors'
              rational motivations as well as their socially constrained and informed
              behavior. The research is designed to test multivariate, dynamic hypotheses
              that link collective action theory, communication and information systems, and
              collaborative work processes and effects.
