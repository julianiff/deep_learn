Abstract    :
                This six-month award will support the participation of a Jon  Miller of the
              Chicago Academy of Sciences in an  organizational meeting concerning a
              cross-national survey of  the public understanding and assessment of
              biotechnology,  headed by John Durant of the Science Museum of London in the 
              U.K., and funded by the European Union.  The objective of US  attendance at the
              organizational meeting is to participate  in the development of the
              questionnaire to be used in the  European survey.  The U.S. investigator brings
              to this effort considerable  expertise in science literacy, public
              understanding of  science and technology, and in biomedical science, as well 
              as experience in comparative efforts that include Canada,  the European Union,
              and Japan.  The European PI heads a  European Union team that will conduct a
              cross-national  project that will analyze biotechnology development in each  of
              the 15 member states, and identify the commonalities  across participating
              countries.  The U.S. investigator will  provide the US perspective to this
              initial phase of the  study.
