Abstract    :
              9602485  Feng      This award supports cooperation between Feng Lin, Wayne 
              State University, and Lin Zhenghui, Shanghai Jiaotong  University, on modeling
              and testing software tools for mixed  signal circuits. The project involves
              development of a  software tool for computer aided design and testing of mixed 
              signal circuits. The proposal is closely related to work  funded under ECS
              9315344.    The project involves an important Institute at Shanghai  Jiaotong
              University, a top-notch technological university in  China.  The Institute for
              VLSI (very large systems  integration) has attracted significant funding from
              domestic  sources as well as from foreign multinationals.  The  Institute has
              substantial resources committed to this joint  project, which involves
              complementary skills and facilities  on both sides.
