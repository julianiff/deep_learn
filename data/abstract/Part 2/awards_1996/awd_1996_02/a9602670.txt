Abstract    :
                Delaware State University  (DSU), a Historically Black College and University,
              is the recipient of  ARI funds to revitalize and consolidate science
              laboratories in the old Science Center.  Constructed in 1964, the facility
              houses the Departments of Chemistry and Physics, but is inadequate to support
              research and training activities.  Limitations include:  poorly designed lab
              spaces, insufficient power and gas supplies, an aged HVAC system and
              dilapidated cabinetry and fixtures.  Due to outdated facilities, specimen
              preparation for SEM work is performed at other institutions. Renovations to
              targeted laboratories will encompass: consolidating research space, upgrading
              HVAC, plumbing and electrical systems, and installing new fume hoods.  Upon
              completion laboratories will comply with ADA and life safety codes. The
              renovations are essential to the growth of the departments and will enhance
              research and training capabilities of undergraduate and graduate students. The
              project will be instrumental in facilitating interdisciplinary research and
              establishing collaborations between  DSU the and other institutions.  Because
              of the University's historical mission, many African American scholars will
              enter the pipeline contributing to the nation's scientific infrastructure.
