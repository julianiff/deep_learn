Abstract    :
                Funding from the NSF's Academic Research Infrastructure Program will enable
              Grinnell College to renovate research laboratories in the Bowen Hall of
              Science.  Constructed in 1952,  space dedicated to the Department of Physics
              has never been renovated.  During the time when the floor plan for Physics was
              designed, research was very limited.  However, since the 1980's the level of
              research and research training activities have increased at a higher rate.  To
              accommodate this growth, the physics research and research training program
              began to utilize spaces originally designed for instruction that now cannot
              adequately support these functions. The renovation plan targets specific areas
              in physics where investigations in atomic, laser and optical physics,
              astronomy, and cryogenics research take place.  Funds will be used to
              reorganize laboratory space, update electrical, HVAC, plumbing systems,
              purchase new lab casework, and bring labs into compliance with ADA and safety
              standards. Not only will the completion of the project enable Grinnell faculty
              and students to perform research that is not feasible in the current facility,
              but it will help the Department integrate research experience with education,
              stimulating students to pursue advance studies in physics.
