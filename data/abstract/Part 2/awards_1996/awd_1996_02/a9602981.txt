Abstract    :
              Experimental studies of the electromagnetic and weak  currents in hadrons and
              hadronic matter are proposed for the  Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator
              Facility (TJNAF). A  major emphasis is placed on measurements of parity
              violation  in the scattering of polarized electrons from nucleons and  light
              nuclei, data which will provide new insights into the  flavor content of these
              systems. Measurements at several  laboratories of the electromagnetic structure
              functions of  the nucleon are also proposed.  A detector fabrication 
              laboratory will be instrumented through support provided by  the office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA), as part of  an enabling initiative for
              enhanced intrumentation  development and procurement.
