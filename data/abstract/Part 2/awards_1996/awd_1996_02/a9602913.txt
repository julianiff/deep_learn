Abstract    :
              9602913  Goodman    This U.S.-Brazil Program award will fund cooperative 
              research between Dr. Morris Goodman of Wayne State  University and Drs. Horacio
              and Paula Schneider from the  Federal University of Para in Belem, Brazil.  The
              Physical  Anthropology and Systematic Biology Programs are providing 
              substantial support as well.  The goal of this research  project is the
              gathering of conclusive molecular evidence on  the phylogeny and systematics of
              Neotropical primates and to  make this evidence available to the scientific
              community via  an electronic database.      The Federal University offers
              access to the unique  biodiversity of the Amazonian region.  The university is 
              home to the Goeldi Museum of Natural History, a national  primate center and
              genetic laboratories, making it a major  scientific center for this type of
              research.  In addition to  a prime site, Dr. Goodman brings his expertise as a
              leader  in molecular phylogenetic studies.  The Brazilians are  internationally
              recognized for their superior work on  Neotropical mammalogy.      The
              resulting findings of this project will be of value to  scientists who deal
              with the problems of ceboid systematics  below the generic level.  They will
              provide a phylogenetic  classification of Neotropical primates from the generic
              to  the superfamily level in which each taxon accurately  represents a
              monophyletic group.  Their World Wide Web page  will work toward providing a
              comprehensive monographic  treatment of the phylogenetic systematics of
              platyrrhine  primates.    ***
