Abstract    :
                  9602229  Chavez   This award supports development of a training program
              involving mathematics, statistics and evolutionary biology.  The project is a
              joint effort of 11 core faculty members and 8 associated faculty from 9
              departments and administrative units who will collaborate in the education and
              training of undergraduate and graduate students.  The didactic and research
              programs will focus on a combination of theoretical and empirical approaches to
              the understanding of evolution considered at scales ranging from that of
              individual genes to that of organisms and populations.  The program aims to
              equip students with a level of understanding of evolutionary biology and of
              applied mathematics sufficient to permit them to work at the forefront of
              modern quantitative biology.
