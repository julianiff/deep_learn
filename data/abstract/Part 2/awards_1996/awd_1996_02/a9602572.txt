Abstract    :
                      9602572  Dodds    Dr. Walter Dodds, Division of Biology, Kansas State 
              University, and Dr. Barry Biggs, National Institute of Water  and Atmospheric
              Research (NIWA), Christchurch, New Zealand  will conduct collaborative research
              in New Zealand on the  metabolism of stream algae.  Mixed assemblages of 
              microorganisms (biofilms or periphyton) coat surfaces in  streams and rivers. 
              These assemblages are generally the  main energy source for higher trophic
              levels in unshaded  temperate region streams.  In stable-flowing, enriched 
              streams periphyton can proliferate causing water management  problems.  Dr.
              Barry Biggs and his co-workers have  characterized extensively the periphyton
              communities and  associated land use practices in a large number of the  highly
              diverse streams and rivers in New Zealand and have  established the best
              empirical model of factors controlling  periphyton biomass and composition from
              any area in the  world.  New Zealand provides an outstanding natural 
              laboratory because heterogeneity of geological, climatic and  human use is
              extreme and occurs over very small spatial  scales (a few 100 km) relative to
              typical continental areas.  Dr. Dodds will link the unique data of his
              counterpart to  small scale metabolic measurements made with flow, light and 
              O2 microprobes and use this information to create a  predictive mechanistic
              model of stream biofilm metabolism  for the different community types.  This
              model will provide  a basis for more general models of stream ecosystem 
              function.  Such models are needed to assess responses of  stream water quality
              and ecosystem function to human  disturbance.
