Abstract    :
              This award supports a new, multidisciplinary research  training program focused
              on aspects of Biogeochemistry  important to increased understanding of
              environmental  change.  A group of 25 faculty drawn from eight  organizational
              units of  Cornell, the Boyce Thmopson  Institute and the Institute for
              Ecosystem studies will  collaborate to develop one of the first U.S. graduate 
              programs in Biogeochemistry.  Training will include a set of  4 required 
              courses,  some newly developed for the RTG,  research rotations in faculty
              laboratories and field  research sites, technical workshops and seminars that
              will  bring leading researchers from other institutions.  Besides  providing
              students with fundamental knowledge of  both  biogeochemistry and ecosystem
              analysis, the program will  emphasize training in the use of state-of-the-art
              techniques  in biogeochemistry and environmental microbiology.  Areas of 
              research to be emphasized include studies of accelerated  nitrogen movement
              through landscapes into rivers and  estuaries, studies of effects of humans on
              nutrient and  water levels in forest ecosystems, and studies of wetland 
              microbiota active in generation of methane.  The goal of the  program is to
              produce highly interactive, creative and  multidisciplinary-based students who
              will be able to  contribute to understanding global change and other 
              environmental problems.  ***
