Abstract    :
                The University of Minnesota at Duluth, the second largest of the four campuses
              of the University of Minnesota system, will receive an award from the Academic
              Research Infrastructure Program to renovate, reconfigure, and modernize
              research and training space in the Chemistry Building.  Constructed in 1948,
              the building houses research programs that focus on analytical, inorganic, and
              organic chemistry, and biochemistry and molecular biology.  Current conditions,
              such as inadequate utilities, substandard fume hoods, and the lack of
              environmental controls adversely affect experiment work and in some instances
              prohibit the pursuit of research problems.  This project will modernize
              research space by installing fume hoods and computer network lines, and
              reconfiguring bench space to accommodate additional students and new research
              areas.  Renovations will improve the HVAC infrastructure to create an
              environment that supports research programs, and renovate research support
              areas to comply with state and federal regulations, thereby creating a safer
              and more efficient research environment.  A new synthetic chemistry laboratory
              will be created to enhance research training by supporting the growth in
              student enrollments and provide efficient space for state-of-the-art 
              instrumentation.  This project will sustain a growing program benefiting 58
              faculty members and their students.
