Abstract    :
                Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) has devoted considerable resources to
              support the expansion and continued growth of a biochemistry initiative in the
              Department of Chemistry.  The increased numbers of students desiring a degree
              in biochemistry, now over 50, with 50% women, has necessitated the
              establishment of a formal biochemistry program.  In 1995, the faculty endorsed
              the incorporation of the interdisciplinary biochemistry program  to create the
              Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.  Current biochemistry and associated
              facilities are grossly inadequate to support quality research.  To ensure the
              success of this initiative and provide students with a first rate research
              experience, WPI and the National Science Foundation will commit resources to
              modernize laboratory space and establish a biochemistry core facility.  
              Renovation of existing research facilities in Goddard Hall, a structure built
              over 30 years ago, is needed to accommodate the growing programs.  Renovations
              will entail reconfiguring of bench space, upgrading HVAC, electrical and
              plumbing systems, and installing new cabinetry, cold room and a built in glass
              washer.  Research programs benefiting from the this project include molecular
              plant pathogen interactions, ion transport though red blood cell membranes,
              synthesis and isolation of biologically active natural products from plant and
              marine sources, and molecular photochemistry and laser spectroscopy.  The
              renovations will increase available laboratory space, ensure safety, and
              enhance the overall research experience enabling students to successfully
              compete in advanced graduate programs.
