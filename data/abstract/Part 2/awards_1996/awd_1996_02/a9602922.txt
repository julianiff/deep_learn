Abstract    :
              Organic individuality has been an important problem in evolutionary and
              developmental biology  for over one hundred years.  Theories of evolution
              usually take for granted that its subjects are  individuals (whose
              characteristics vary), while developmental biology tries to explain how 
              individuals come to have their most characteristic properties.  But what does
              it mean to be an  `individual,` and how are individuals in biology--individual
              organisms, cells, or DNA  molecules--different from individual entities in,
              say, chemistry, quantum mechanics, or  sociology?   The PI will use the Fifth
              International Congress of Systemic and Evolutionary  Biology, to be held in
              Budapest, Hungary, August 17-24, 1996, as an occasion to gather a group  of
              philosophers working on this theme.  They would prepare papers for presentation
              at the  conference and meet among themselves and with others present to
              initiate inquiry into the nature  of organic individualism.
