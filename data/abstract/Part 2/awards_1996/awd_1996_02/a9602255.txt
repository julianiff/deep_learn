Abstract    :
                This award renews support for a multidisciplinary training  research training
              program focused on the biology of plant  roots, extending from the physiology
              of roots to the ecology  of the rhizosphere that surrounds them in the soil. 
              The  program represents a joint effort of 15 faculty drawn from 8  departments.
               Groups of trainees at the undergraduate and  graduate level will work with
              faculty teams as they design  and implement research and training initiatives. 
              Trainees  will participate in formal courses, retreats, workshops, and  a
              seminar series.  At the same time as they acquire the  skills and understanding
              required to pursue original  research, trainees are expected to develop
              professional  skills in teamwork, resource allocation and management, 
              teaching, mentoring, and outreach as a direct result of the  training.
