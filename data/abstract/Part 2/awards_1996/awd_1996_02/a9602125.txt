Abstract    :
              9602125  Goodman  This study tests hypotheses concerning long-term consequences
              of criminal justice involvement for victims of child sexual abuse.
              Participation in criminal prosecutions, especially testifying in court, may
              results in emotional harm and negative attitudes. In the proposed
              prospective-longitudinal study, 218 children and their caretakers will be
              followed up 10 years after they participated in criminal prosecutions for which
              the children were alleged victims of sex crimes. The original study gathered
              detailed information about the abuse, the legal case, courtroom testimony,
              children's and caretakers' emotional well being, and children's and caretakers'
              reactions to the legal system. In this study, former participants and their
              caretakers will be reinterviewed concerning present mental health,
              victimization, criminal behavior, memory, and attitudes about the legal system.
              A matched comparison group of adolescents and adults with no known history of
              child abuse or legal intervention and their caretakers will also be
              interviewed.  Data will be analyzed in relation to earlier indices of mental
              health, characteristics of the sexual assault, and specific legal experiences
              (e.g., whether or not the child testified, case outcome). Factors contributing
              to or mediating negative psychological consequences will be identified. Results
              will provide important scientific information about the impact of laws and
              legal experience on former victims of child sexual abuse.  %%%%
