Abstract    :
                The National Science Foundation awards Gonzaga University ARI funds for the
              renovation of research and training facilities in Hughes Hall.  Erected in
              1962, Hughes Hall is home to the Department of Biology where six faculty
              members and their students pursue investigations involving cell and molecular
              biology, ecology, behavior, and physiology.  Space, originally occupied by
              chemical engineering, coupled with outdated infrastructure components, is
              deficient in meeting the needs of Biology's research and training programs. 
              Gonzaga has embarked upon a five phase renovation plan to improve the sciences,
              including this Phase two project to renovate research lab modules for biology. 
              Poorly designed space will be reconfigured to provide efficient use and
              flexibility, consolidate spaces for operational productivity, and create
              dedicated research modules. Plumbing for gas, distilled water, compressed air
              and acid  waste will be improved in addition to the installation of new fume
              hoods.  Electrical, electronic, and fiber optic distribution systems will be
              upgraded to meet increasing equipment, computer and communications
              requirements.  Laboratories will also be modernized to meet ADA and life safety
              codes.  Renovations will allow the department to fully implement the
              incorporation of research as a means of teaching and training undergraduates
              students in the biological sciences,  Individual and collaborative research
              will permit continuing application of a lab-based curriculum and enhance the
              faculty -student interface, enabling the department to better integrate
              research and education.
