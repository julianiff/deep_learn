Abstract    :
                The research performed at Scripps Institution of Oceanography encompasses all
              of the ocean sciences including the relationship between the atmosphere and the
              ocean.   Over the years scientists have focused on developing and expanding
              basic theorems to understand and predict the physical and biological world. 
              Acquiring field data is absolutely necessary to this work, and the success of
              field research and the development of new research ideas is dependent upon the
              technology available. The majority of researchers use field instruments to
              collect data at sea or under extreme conditions of temperature, pressure or
              humidity. Current instrument test facilities at Scripps are unreliable and
              inadequate to support research in ocean acoustics, coastal dynamics, physical
              oceanography, marine geology and geophysics, and marine and atmospheric
              meteorology. NSF funds will be used to replace fixed equipment  for
              instrumentation facilities that will be consolidated as an integrated test
              facility.  This project will significantly improve efficiency and reduce the
              time required to fabricate and modify instruments.  Improved capabilities will
              amplify and expand graduate training in the development, calibration,
              operating, and modification research equipment.  Modernized facilities will
              impact experimental work conducted by 38 faculty, 38 postdocs, 60 Ph.D.
              graduate students and 124 research staff, and will continue to be an ocean
              science resource for the scientific community.
