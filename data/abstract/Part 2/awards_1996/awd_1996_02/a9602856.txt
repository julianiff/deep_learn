Abstract    :
              9602856  Nees  This collaboration between The Center for Ultrafast Optical 
              Science (CUOS) at the University of Michigan and MEDOX  Electro-Optics, Inc.
              will address the fundamental barriers  to the dynamic range of picosecond and
              subpicosecond streak  cameras.  The research effort will concentrate on the 
              reduction of jitter in streak cameras to allow accumulation  of the data from
              several ultrafast events.  By using linear  photoconductive switching
              technology to generate the voltage  ramp in the streak tube a jitter-free
              voltage ramp can be  generated.  The photoconductors used to generate this ramp
               will be characterized and the effect of laser amplitude  fluctuations on the
              absolute timing of the signal will be  studied.  Several experiments involving
              optoelectronically  swept streak cameras will then be performed to ascertain
              the  effectiveness of the jitter-reduction method and to  understand the
              remaining limitations on dynamic range and  temporal resolution.  This activity
              is supported jointly by the Division of  Physics and the office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities of  the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
              Sciences, and  is funded under the NSF "Grant Opportunities for Academic 
              Liaison with Industry" (GOALI) Program.  ***
