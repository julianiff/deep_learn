Abstract    :
              9602257  Mendoza  This award provides limited additional funds to an 
              established multidisciplinary Research Training Group (RTG)  in Animal
              Behavior.  First established in 1992, the RTG has  helped create a focus for
              research and education at all post-  secondary levels in the University of
              California at Davis.  The study of animal behavior provides new insights into
              the  study of animals as organisms.  Increasingly,  multidisciplinary
              approaches that recognize the interaction  of genetic, developmental,
              physiological and environmental  determinants are playing an important role in
              the analysis  of behavior. The group of participating faculty has grown to 
              include 26 junior and senior investigators from 10  departments of the
              University.  The funds awarded will  provide short-term stipends for graduate
              students that  permit summer fieldwork and other summer research  activities. 
              In addition, funds will be used to bring  investigators from other research and
              academic institutions  to the campus for an intensive spring workshop that caps
              a  year-long course in interdisciplinary studies of animal  behavior open to
              all students..  ***
