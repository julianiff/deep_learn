Abstract    :
              9602234    This award renews support for a multi-institutional Research 
              Training Group in Evolutionary Primatology at five  institutions in New York
              City.  The faculty group includes  30 evolutionary, population and behavioral
              biologists at the  City University of New York, Columbia University, New York 
              University, the American Museum of Natural History and the  Wildlife
              Conservation Society.  The funds awarded will  provide stipends for graduate
              students,  will defray part of  the cost of the trainees' research, including
              field work and  will help support an annual colloqium.  In addition, funds 
              will be used to purchase specialized research equipment to  be used by trainees
              and to bring investigators from other  research and academic institutions to
              give research seminars  and in some cases, to participate in longer term
              training  activities.  During the original period of support, the 
              participating academic institutions have developed and  refined a unique
              graduate program that allows their students  to take courses and pursue
              research at any of the five  member institutions.  Evolutionary primatology
              draws its theory, methods and  empirical data from many areas within the
              biological  sciences, anthropology, and geology.  The research programs  of the
              participating faculty focus on human and non-human  primates from the
              perspectives of morphology, paleontology,  systematics, molecular and
              population genetics, behavior,  ecology, and conservation biology.  Thus the
              training  provided by this group will equip students with the broad  background
              necessary for integrative studies in this  challenging and interesting area.
