Abstract    :
              This award supports a new, multidisciplinary research  training program focused
              on discovery and characterization  of novel enzymes and proteins from diverse
              microbes.  A  group of 11 faculty from the Departments of Chemistry and of 
              Biochemistry and Molecular Biology have developed an  innovative program that
              will provide microbiology students a  level of chemical and biochemical
              training not available in  traditional programs and, conversely, chemistry and 
              biochemistry students with unprecedented training in  microbial biology.  A
              central feature of the program is  trainee participation in  a "research team" 
              consisting of  two faculty members and undergraduate, graduate,  postdoctoral
              students.  Following lab rotations in their  first year,  graduate students
              will join one of the teams  and will have two mentors, one with
              molecular/biochemical  expertise, the other with expertise in microbiology. 
              Postdoctoral trainees will enter these groups directly, and  will also have two
              mentors, a novel arrangement at this  training level.  In addition, graduate
              students will have  the opportunity to spend up to four months as an intern in 
              an industrial or other non-academic setting.  Thus the  training is designed to
              prepare students for diverse  opportunities in a variety of employment sectors.
