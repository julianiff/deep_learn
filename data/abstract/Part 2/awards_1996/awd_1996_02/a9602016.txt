Abstract    :
              This project consists of collaborative grants to cultural anthropologists at the
              Universities of Delaware and North Carolina.  The researchers will study how
              collective cultural forms influence individual action by studying the
              environmental movement in the US.  Environmentalism is a new social movement
              organized at local, national and international levels.  Majorities in opinion
              polls identify themselves as `environmentalists`, suggesting a link between
              environmentalism and personal identity.  Using ethnographic techniques of
              participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and personal narratives,
              the project will study three face-to-face environmental groups, one national
              environmental organization that communicates with members through mail and
              telephone, and a random sample of citizens not belonging to any group.  The
              researchers will ask how an individual's identity as an `environmentalist`
              relates to their observed behavior and energy use.  A national survey will be
              built from the ethnographic research to check for the hypothesized relations
              between identity and action.  The results promise to advance theory in
              psychological anthropology, new social movements and identity formation as
              collective phenomenon.  The results will be of practical value to federal
              agencies concerned with behavioral factors in environmental degradation, to
              environmental educators, and to environmental action groups.
