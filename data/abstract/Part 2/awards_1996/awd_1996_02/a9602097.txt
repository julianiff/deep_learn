Abstract    :
              This project, a summer `pilot` workshop for professors and graduate students in
              various fields of science and engineering,  seeks to help science and
              engineering teachers at universities and colleges in the Rocky Mountain region
              develop strategies for teaching research ethics to undergraduate and graduate
              students.  The workshop, led by people actively teaching ethics in science,
              will allow participants to learn more about ethical issues in research and to
              develop ways of incorporating ethics into the science curriculum through
              designing new courses, modifying existing courses, and by mainstreaming ethics
              into various aspects of formal instruction and informal training. To assess the
              effectiveness of the workshop after participants return to their home
              institutions, an electronic network (listserver) will be set up for
              participants and workshop leaders.  This will allow participants to report back
              on what they have learned in the workshop, how it can be improved, and what
              plans they have developed to implement strategies learned.
