Abstract    :
              9602249  This award provides additional support for a multidisciplinary 
              training research training program focused on Plant-insect  interactions. The
              program, a joint effort of 14 faculty from  five departments, aims to train
              young scientists to couple  basic understanding of plant genetics and molecular
              biology  with similar knowledge of insect physiology, behavior and  ecology. 
              Training is provided at the undergraduate, graduate  and postdoctoral levels
              through a variety of new courses,  rotations, seminars and retreats.  Trainees
              are supported  through several mechanisms, including stipends and small  awards
              to help defray costs of materials and supplies for  particular projects. 
              Opportunities for industrial experiences  are available; graduate students are
              required to teach and  must participate in a short course on ethical aspects of
               scientific research.
