Abstract    :
                  9602144  Lester    12th International Biophysics Congress Travel Program   
              The International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics will hold its General
              Assembly and 12th International Congress in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, on
              11-16, August 1996.  It is proposed that the Biophysical Society administer a
              travel grant program offering a limited number of travel awards to qualified
              U.S. Scientists who may require such assistance, with preference to young
              investigators and invited participants.   The U.S. National Committee for the
              International Union of Pure and Applied Biophysics (USNC/IUPAB) of the National
              Academy of Sciences will distribute applications, and receive the completed
              applications.  Responsibility for screening travel grant applications will be
              vested in a Committee of the Biophysical Society chosen by the Council of the
              Society or its Executive Committee for a slate of candidates provided by
              USNC/IUPAB.  The Biophysical Society and the USNC/IUPAB feel that qualified
              U.S. scientists should be assisted to attend this Congress to facilitate
              exchange of recent significant developments and dissemination of biophysical
              research data long before it could appear in journal form.  In order to
              facilitate the maximum number of U.S. scientists in receiving travel awards,
              the Biophysical Society has agreed to manage this program without assessing an
              overhead charge.  %%%
