Abstract    :
              MMATE 2000 Project - Maricopa Mathematics Advanced Technology Education 2000
              Project (MMATE 2000)    The current mathematics curriculum does not adequately
              align with the needs of technicians and future technicians in an advanced
              technology workplace. The objective of the Maricopa Mathematics ATE 2000 (MMATE
              2000) Project is to close the gap between what is taught and what students need
              for the workplace, and to continually close that gap by applying continuous
              improvement methodologies. The Project will engage community college and
              university faculty from mathematics and related disciplines and representatives
              from 12 semiconductor manufacturing industries in the Phoenix area,
              collaborating to develop course materials for 8 modules (15 class hours each)
              that emphasize how mathematics is used in the high-performance workplace.
              Through mini-internships in industry and MMATE 2000 workshops, faculty will
              increase their awareness of how mathematics is used in an advanced technology
              environment and will learn how to use the course materials in the classroom.
              Faculty will work with industry on a continual basis to review the mathematics
              content of the curriculum and maintain the currency of the applications that
              drive the course materials. The materials will be disseminated through a
              publisher with a national sales force. The target audience is all mathematics
              students who take courses below college algebra, especially those preparing for
              jobs as technicians in an advanced technology workplace. MMATE 2000 will
              improve the quality of the human resource base for advanced technology
              industries by significantly improving the way technicians are educated in
              mathematics.
