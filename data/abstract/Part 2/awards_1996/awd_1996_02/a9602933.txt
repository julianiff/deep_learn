Abstract    :
              9602933  Veblen    This Americas Program award will fund travel and related 
              expenses for eleven scientists and two graduate students to  participate in the
               Southern Connection Congress to be held  in Valdivia, Chile, January 6-11,
              1997.  Organizers are Dr.  Thomas T. Veblen, University of Colorado, Boulder,
              in  collaboration with Dr. Mary Kalin Arroyo, Universidad de  Chile, Santiago. 
               This congress will be organized around  the theme of Southern Temperate Biota
              and Ecosystems: Past,  Present and Future. The theme will  be developed by 
              presentations and discussions around major biological and  ecological
              questions, recent advances in research on  southern temperate biota and
              ecosystems, evaluations of  science-based strategies for the sustainable use of
               resources, and the interface between pure research and  development.    The
              Southern Connection was created to bring together  scientists conducting
              research on the biota and ecosystems  of the temperate latitudes of the
              Southern Hemisphere with  the  purpose of  improving communications among
              scientists  working in the region.  Participation of US-based scientists  will
              allow them to interact with a broad diversity of  Southern Hemisphere
              scientists  Through such interaction and  exchange of information, research on
              a wide range of  environmental biology topics will be stimulated and  improved.
