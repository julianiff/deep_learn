Abstract    :
                                                9602574  Fausch    This is a 12 month award
              proposed by Dr. Kurt Fausch,  Colorado State University and Dr. Colin Townsend,
              University  of Otago, New Zealand.  Dr. Fausch requests funds for travel  to
              New Zealand.  The primary objective of this project is to  understand salmonid
              invasions worldwide.  The tasks are to  analyze the characteristics and
              mechanisms of salmonid  invasions, to test the predictions based on invasion
              ecology  theory and available data, and to develop new models for  predicting
              effects of specific introductions.  This project  is important in the area of 
              ecology and can lead to  significant advances in our understanding of salmonid 
              invasions worldwide.
