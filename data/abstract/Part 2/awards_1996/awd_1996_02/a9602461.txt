Abstract    :
              Schimenti  9602461  A meeting on the t complex, a complex locus whose function
              is critical for notochord development but which is also associated with many
              different phenotypes in several different organisms, will be held at the
              Jackson Laboratory, September 29 to October 2, 1996. The unique properties of
              genes associated with the t complex have attracted investigators from a wide
              range of disciplines including population biology, genetics, developmental
              biology and evolutionary biology.  %%%  This meeting will bring together
              scientists of different professional ages and from different professional
              backgrounds in an environment conducive to in-depth interactions.
