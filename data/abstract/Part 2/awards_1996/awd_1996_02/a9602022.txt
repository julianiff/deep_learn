Abstract    :
              INT 9602022  Langdon      This U.S.-Czech materials research project between Dr.
              Terence Langdon of the University of Southern California (USC) and Dr. Vaclav
              Sklenicka of the Czech Institute of Physics and Materials, Brno, will focus on
              magnesium metal matrix composites.  Drs. Langdon and Sklenicka, together with
              another Czech colleague, Dr. Pavel Lukac of Charles University, Prague, will
              examine mechanical properties, specifically the creep behavior, of these
              composites.  The creep experiments will be conducted at USC using two advanced
              magnesium composites produced in Germany by squeeze casting.  Subsequently,
              these creep test results will be integrated with data obtained from tensile
              testing in Prague and damage assessment experiments in Brno using quantitative
              metallography.  Overall, the researchers expect to broaden fundamental
              understanding of the deformation of magnesium-based composites.  Their results
              may have implications for new processing techniques used in metal forming
              industries.    This project in advanced materials and processing fulfills the
              program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts
              in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and
              pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.       ??
