Abstract    :
                Funding from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will enable the
              University of California at San Francisco to renovate existing research space
              dedicated to protein engineering studies.  The primary focus of the Laboratory
              has been on understanding and applying structure-function relationships in
              proteins with a particular concentration on proteases and their natural
              inhibitors using genetic and biochemical methods.  Protein engineering
              technologies are used to create wild-type and variant proteins in reagent
              quantities that are then analyzed both biochemically and biophysically to study
              substrate specificity, catalytic mechanism and structure. Located on the ninth
              floor of the UCSF Medical Sciences Building, the facilities provide a unique
              window on the principles and practice of protein engineering and its potential
              application to biotechnology.  Research space, constructed 40 years ago that
              has been used for various significant scientific contributions in protein
              engineering since 1985, will be renovated.  These facilities include four
              rooms: Molecular Biochemistry Laboratory,  a Fermentation and Sterilization
              Room, a Cold Room, and a Computer Modeling Room.  The lack of items such as no
              sinks, drains, vacuum and natural gas will be provided, a fume hood will be
              installed, and repairs to the electrical and refrigeration systems will be
              made.  The Program is extremely productive and actively recruits high school,
              undergraduate, and minority students who aspire to become scientists interested
              in interdisciplinary research.  Students experience many aspects of
              biotechnology from computer modeling to hands-on protein engineering to
              structure determination.  Not only will this project enhance collaborations,
              but it will promote the development of new macromolecular tools needed to
              conduct state- of-the-art biotechnology research.
