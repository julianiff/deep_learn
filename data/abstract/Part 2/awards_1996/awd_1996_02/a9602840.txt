Abstract    :
              9602840  Vermaas    This award supports the participation of 15 US scientists in
               a US-Japan seminar on Advances in the Molecular Biology of  Photosynthesis, to
              be held at Grand Canyon National Park  from November 21 until November 25,
              1996. The co-organizers  are Professor Wim Vermaas of Arizona State University
              and  Professor Teruo Ogawa of Nagoya University.  The theme of  the seminar was
              chosen to highlight recent advances in the  US and in Japan in the use of
              molecular genetics and genetic  engineering to elucidate processes related to 
              photosynthesis.  Both the utilization of unicellular model  systems and the
              development of appropriate techniques to  study higher-plant systems have
              proven to be very fruitful  to elucidate the role of particular subunits in 
              photosynthetic complexes and to address questions regarding  gene expression as
              a function of developmental stage and  nutrient and light availability.  A
              particularly noteworthy  effort in this area is the sequencing of the genome of
              a  cyanobacterium in the group of Dr. S. Tabata, who will be a  Japanese
              participant in the workshop.  This is the first  example of a complete genomic
              DNA sequence of a  photosynthetic organism, and provides the basis for a wide 
              spectrum of research, including the determination of the  role of genes and
              open reading frames and their regulatory  mechanisms.   Participants are among
              the most active  researchers in the area of molecular biology of 
              photosynthesis, and this seminar is expected to establish  and nurture
              collaborative research between US and Japanese  scientists who will mutually
              benefit from these research  ties.  ***
