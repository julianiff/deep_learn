Abstract    :
              9602972  Berry    This Americas Program award will support Dr. Paul E. Berry, 
              Missouri Botanical Garden, and Dr. Otto Huber, Fundacion  Instituto Botanico de
              Venezuela, in a collaborative project  to complete an updated and computerized
              catalog of the  vascular plants of Venezuela. The catalog will be assembled  as
              a database in Microsoft Access and will become the core  of a standardized
              plant nomenclature and inventory system  centered at the National Herbarium in
              Caracas.  A printed  version of the catalog will also be produced and
              distributed  to all interested parties.    The completion of this project will
              result in a wider  accessibility and use of plant-related data to Venezuela and
               a framework will be established that will facilitate general  herbarium
              curation, as well as provide structured data for  individualized projects such
              as Geographic Information  systems and environmental impact studies.    ***
