Abstract    :
                The University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR), founded as the Missouri School of 
              Mines in 1870,  is one of four universities in the University of Missouri
              System.  Officially designated as Missouri's technological university, the
              institution has been recognized as one of the best undergraduate engineering
              schools in the country.  Part of the tradition of excellence is reflected in
              the Electrical Engineering Department's research and training programs. 
              Faculty and students, including both graduate and undergraduate, actively
              conduct research in the fields of:  Power Systems, Electric Machines, Devices
              and Power Electronics; Electro-magnetic Compatibility; Digital Devices;
              Controls; Communications and Signal Processing; Optical Systems; and Solid
              State Devices.  However, current conditions of the Electrical Engineering
              Building, constructed in 1959, are less than optimal to support research
              activities.  Infrastructure utilities are inadequate, better facilities for
              communication network cabling are needed, and the building does not comply with
              current safety and ADA regulations.  The National Science Foundation and UMR
              will form a partnership to improve existing research space for research
              personnel in the Engineering Building.  Funds will be used to renovate
              experimental, computer, and undergraduate research facilities. Modernizing
              research space for undergraduates will encourage more to participate in
              research, stimulating students to pursue graduate studies in engineering.   In
              addition to providing a safe working environment, and increasing research
              productivity, the project will assist the Department in its efforts to recruit
              new faculty.
