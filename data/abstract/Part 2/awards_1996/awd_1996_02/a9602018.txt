Abstract    :
                  Proposal: 9602018  PI: Feder      This workshop examines multidisciplinary
              approaches to research problems in the biological sciences, including the
              present constraints on multidiscplinarity and how best to facilitate such
              integrative research.  The workshop uses the topic of biological responses that
              are induced by environmental perturbations as a scientific focus because
              research on this topic exemplifies how molecular, functional (e.g.,
              ecophysiological), and evolutionary approaches can be merged and integrated. 
              The organizers and 25 participants with expertise in this broad area, but
              representing a diversity of interests, career stages and backgrounds will
              participate in the event.  Two major components will be considered: (1) A
              scientific component, in which the participants would consider how discrete
              approaches to understanding inducible responses in organisms can be combined
              and synthesized to facilitate scientific progress; and (2) A science
              policy/infrastructure/education component in which the participants would
              consider whether the elements in the careers of scientific researchers (e.g.,
              development of interest in science, predoctoral and postdoctoral training,
              activities of beginning and established researchers) and in the formal
              structures with which they interact (e.g., academia, industry, government,
              professional organizations) impede or facilitate multidisciplinary research.
              The workshop will culminate in a series of recommendations to the National
              Science Foundation with respect to its potential role in the facilitation of
              multidisciplinary research and training.
