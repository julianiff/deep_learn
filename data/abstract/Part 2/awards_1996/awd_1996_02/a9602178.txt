Abstract    :
              9602178  Thomas       The grant supports research by a faculty member under  the
              NSF program Research In Undergraduate Institutions.  He,  undergraduate
              students and a Master's degree candidate  participate in an experiment at
              Fermilab to study Charm  baryon properties as members of a collaboration.  They
               participate in data taking operations at Fermilab, as well  as have
              responsibility for some software development and  data analysis.  ***
