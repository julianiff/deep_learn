Abstract    :
              9602223  Wessler  This award provides additional support for a multidisciplinary
               training research training program focused on the mechanisms  of plant
              evolution.  The program, a joint effort of 9 faculty  from three departments,
              aims to educate and train students in  plant systematics,  population biology
              and molecular genetics.  Following three lab rotations and appropriate
              coursework,  graduate students undertake interdisciplinary thesis projects 
              that are meant to span at least two of the three focal areas.  Advanced
              students are required to undertake an internship with  a participating faculty
              member whose expertise is  complementary to that of their thesis advisor.  This
               internship occurs during the period when thesis research is  underway, and is
              meant to include studies integral to the  thesis., thereby facilitating
              interdisciplinary projects.  In  addition, the program provides training of
              undergraduate  students through a summer intern program targeted at students 
              at the University of Georgia and nearby colleges.
