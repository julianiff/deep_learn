Abstract    :
                The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga is the recipient of funds from the
              National Science Foundation to renovate mathematical research and research
              training space.  Currently, the Department of Mathematics is housed in the
              oldest building on campus that was built in 1902.  Research activities have
              been inhibited by inadequate space configuration, faulty cabling and electrical
              connections, poor ventilation, lighting, and HVAC systems, and an electrical
              system that has reached its capacity.  The facility  is also inaccessible to
              the disabled.  Specifically, NSF funds will be used to replace the existing
              amount of square footage of space dedicated to the mathematical sciences, which
              includes creating space for a laboratory, research-based interdisciplinary
              approach to training students in mathematics.  The renovations will allow for
              the enhancement and expansion of current research in statistics and applied
              probability simulations, such as Monte Carol techniques.  Activities will also
              be enhanced in the area of inverse scattering, optimization, control and PDE,
              to include environmental and resource modeling.  New research methods will be
              developed in the areas of wave propagation, industrial math, matrix theory, and
              statistical finance modeling. It is anticipated with modernized facilities the
              department will attract more students into the math career pipeline by
              providing increased opportunities for research experiences and access to state
              of the art technology.  The project will increase collaborations with faculty
              from other regional and national institutions, as well as provide the
              foundation for a graduate program.
