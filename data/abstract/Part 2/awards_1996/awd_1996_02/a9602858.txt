Abstract    :
              Adult humans evidence a left brain hemisphere bias for processing the formal
              properties of language (e.g., semantics) and a right hemisphere bias for
              processing the emotional content of language (e.g., intonation, affect). There
              is also evidence of hemispheric biases in processing facial expressions,
              contingent upon whether the emotion is positive or negative. The evolutionary
              origins of these asymmetries remain unclear.  This proposal has been designed
              to address this gap in our understanding, conducting research on a population
              of semi-free-ranging rhesus macaques. Part one explores asymmetry in facial
              expression and tests the hypothesis that negative/withdrawal emotions are
              associated with a right brain hemisphere/left side of the face bias, whereas
              positive/approach emotions are associated with left hemisphere/right side of
              the face biases.  Possible developmental changes in this pattern of expression
              will be assessed by recording from infants and adults. Part two studies
              perception of vocalizations, using playback experiments to assess whether
              rhesus monkeys evidence a left hemisphere bias/right ear bias.  Natural and
              manipulated calls will be used.  Part three examines whether rhesus monkeys
              show a left hemisphere/right side of the face bias during vocal production, as
              occurs in human adults while speaking.
