Abstract    :
                Coastal Carolina University, located in Conway, SC, is the recipient of ARI
              funds for the renovation and partial replacement of environmental chemistry
              laboratories.  Existing facilities in the Science Building are under stress due
              to a phenomenal growth in the number of students participating in the sciences.
               Because the labs were not designed to accommodate a large number of student
              projects, adequate space has become the major impediment in expanding research
              activities for undergraduates in biology, chemistry, and marine science.  To
              increase the efficiency of space and time usage, the university has pledged to 
              modernize existing space for faculty and student researchers.  In conjunction
              to the reconfiguration of space, renovations will consist of:  upgrading
              electrical, plumbing and lighting systems, replacing aged fume hoods and water
              distiller, installing benches, cabinets and shelving, and  providing for gas
              cylinder and hazardous chemical storage.  Renovations will include additional
              safety stations and ensure space complies with ADA regulations.  Revitalized
              facilities will improve the department's availability to facilitate student
              research and will enhance collaborations between faculty and student
              researchers. Although the institution and science departments have been
              successful in increasing enrollments of female students, it is anticipated that
              this project will aid the university in its recruitment efforts to provide
              educational opportunities for minority students, including  prospects from
              minority families with no history of college matriculation.
