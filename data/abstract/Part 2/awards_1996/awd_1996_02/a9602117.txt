Abstract    :
                   Salmon fish have a remarkable reproductive cycle among  vertebrate animals
              because in many species the adults die after  spawning.  It is now known that
              this death is not simply a result  of the exhaustively long migration also
              common to many species.   Hormones of the neuroendocrine system are involved in
              behaviors  such as reproduction and responses to stress.  This project will 
              use salmon as a model system to test the novel idea whether  reproductive
              activity in might be acting as the equivalent of a  chronic stress, leading to
              advanced aging and death in salmon.   Tissue culture and immunological
              techniques will be used to  determine the role of hormones secreted by the
              pituitary gland or  the hypothalamus, and whether, compared to other animals,
              an  overproduction may cause the surge of cortisol found in spawning  animals,
              which may in turn be a factor leading to early death.     Results from this
              study will not only be important for  understanding the interactions of
              neuroendocrine hormones and the  brain, but it also will have an impact beyond
              neuroscience into the  areas of reproductive physiology and of aging.
