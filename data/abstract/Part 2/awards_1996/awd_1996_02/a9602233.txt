Abstract    :
                This award supports a new, multidisciplinary  research training program
              focused on the structural  biology of macromolecular assemblies.  A group of 15
               faculty drawn from the Departments of Biological  Science, Chemistry and
              Physics have developed a  comprehensive and challenging program to train 
              undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students in  a wide range of
              state-of-the-art experimental and  theoretical approaches to structure and
              function.  Research areas to be emphasized include study of  filamentous 
              macromolecular assemblies responsible  for membrane structure and cell
              structure and  motility.   Participating undergraduate students  from Florida
              State University and Florida A& M will  gain research experience during the
              academic year  and summer term.  Graduate students will complete a  required
              set of new courses in macromolecular  assembly structure, dynamics, and
              computational  optimization.  Short, intense workshops will provide  hands-on
              training in a variety of techniques, and  there will be an annual symposium
              coupled with a  program review by external experts.   An unusual and  important
              aspect of the training at both graduate  and postdoctoral levels will be an
              emphasis on  development of new methodology.  Another is that  trainees at all
              levels will be able to use the  unique facilities of  the National High
              Magnetic  Field Laboratory, whose staff includes several of  the participating
              faculty.  The students trained  through this program are expected to have a
              critical  understanding of important biological phenomena of  cellular
              structure and motility, and of the powerful  new biophysical techniques needed
              to investigate  them successfully.
