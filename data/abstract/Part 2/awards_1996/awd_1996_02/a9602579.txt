Abstract    :
              9602579  Shore    This award will support the travel of  the principal 
              investigator, Professor Richard Shore, Department of  Mathematics, Cornell
              University, and two junior  investigators, Professor Peter Cholak, Department
              of  Mathematics, University of Notre Dame, and Professor Andre  Nies,
              Department of Mathematics, University of Chicago, to  New Zealand over a three
              year-period.  In New Zealand, they  will work with colleagues in the logic
              groups at Victoria  University, notably Professor Rodney Downey, and at
              Auckland  University, including Dr. Bakhadyr M. Khoussainov who  recently took
              up his position after serving as an Assistant  Professor at Cornell University.
               They will each work on a  number of topics in recursion theory united by a
              common  theme of  studying how computation interacts with various  areas of
              logic, mathematics and computer science.  Most of  the work will be done by
              applying the methods of  computability theory such as the priority method and
              other  tools of logic such as the coding theories to the study of 
              effectiveness issues in other mathematics settings.  This  project combines the
              strengths of three of the leading U.S.  groups in logic with one of the leading
              centers of logic  research in the Pacific Basin at Victoria University in 
              Wellington.
