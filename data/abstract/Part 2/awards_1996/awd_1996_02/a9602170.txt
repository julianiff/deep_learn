Abstract    :
              9602170  Goldman  This project will create an archive of U.S. Supreme Court oral
              arguments in 500 cases raising constitutional issues. The archived arguments
              will be made available on the World Wide Web to researchers, teachers, and
              students.  Audio files will be digitized at near compact disc quality and will
              be stored on a dedicated audio server.  Information files about the cases will
              be stored on a database server to allow complicated searches.  Previously,
              research on the Supreme Court was rarely based on direct behavioral evidence. 
              Scholars who wished to use available audio tapes of oral argument were sharply
              limited in their ability to do so because of limitations on availability.  The
              relative ease with which audio can be deployed on the World Wide Web will
              enable scholars and students to reexamine landmark cases and current
              controversies.  %%%%%
