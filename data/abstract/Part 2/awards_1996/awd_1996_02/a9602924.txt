Abstract    :
              9602924  Jose    This U.S.-Argentina award will support collaborative  research
              between Dr. Jorge V. Jose of Northeastern  University and Drs. Daniel Dominguez
              and Christina Wieko at  the Centro Atomico Bariloche in Rio Negro, Argentina,
              to  carry on research on nonequilibrium dynamics problems with  non-linear
              interactions.  The researchers have chosen as the  physical paradigms for study
              artificially fabricated  Josephson junction arrays and high-temperature 
              superconductors driven by external and self-induced  electromagnetic fields. 
              They will examine the transport and  thermodynamic properties of these systems
              by considering  ever more realistic models that will be tested against 
              experimental findings.    This project will unite two top research groups, one
              from  Bariloche Research Center which is considered to be one of  the most
              distinguished Latin American institutions for the  study of condensed matter
              physics.  This research will  further the development of new devices in the
              area of  mesoscopic electronics.  ***
