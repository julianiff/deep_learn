Abstract    :
              9602978  Potter    This U.S.-Brazil Program award will support collaborative 
              research involving Dr. Joseph E. Potter of the University of  Texas at Austin,
              Dr. Charles H. Wood of the University of  Florida, and Dr. Alicia Bercovich, of
              the Instituto  Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica (IBGE) in activities 
              designed to incorporate new methods and statistical  techniques, particularly
              the application of geographic  information systems (GIS) and econometric
              software, into the  study of demographic and environmental processes in Brazil.
                 This grant will allow these researchers to train in and  fully develop the
              GIS and econometric techniques to analyze  three aspects of Brazilian
              demography and population and  environment relations:  levels and trends in
              fertility and  their correlation with access to mass media and other social 
              and economic determinants of fertility; deforestation in the  Amazon basin and
              its relation to demographic change, and the  relation between land tenure
              security and resource use in  the Amazon basin.  By enhancing the ability to
              combine GIS  and spatial econometrics, this collaboration has the  potential to
              promote cutting-edge of socio-demographic  research in both the U.S. and
              Brazil.  It will also  facilitate the execution of the two institutions'
              agendas  and advance research on demographic and environmental  processes.
