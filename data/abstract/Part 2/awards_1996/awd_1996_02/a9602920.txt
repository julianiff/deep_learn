Abstract    :
              9602920  Rafelski    This U.S.-Brazil Planning Visit will bring together Dr. 
              Johann Rafelski of the University of Arizona and Professor  Takeshi Kodama at
              the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro  to prepare a research project on the
              properties of matter at  extreme density and temperature, as formed in
              relativistic  heavy ion collisions, and to develop the required kinetic  theory
              methods.    This project would consist of two components:  the  development of
              the theoretical tools and techniques, and  their application to the dynamical
              physical systems.  The  combined efforts of these researchers will lead to 
              considerable progress in a number of important physical  problems.  ***
