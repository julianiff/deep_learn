Abstract    :
              9602240  Wraight  This award provides additional support for a 
              multidisciplinary training research training program focused  on the study of
              photosynthesis in contexts ranging from  agronomy to biophysics.  Trainees at
              the undergraduate,  graduate and postdoctoral level participate in
              collaborative  research projects involving, in addition, at least two of  nine
              participating faculty members.  Training provides a  sound foundation in the
              application of a variety of genetic,  biophysical and  biochemical techniques
              to the investigation  of phenomena that extend in scale from the molecular to
              the  ecological.  In addition to these efforts, the program  provides an
              intensive summer workshop in "Photosynthesis and  Global Climate Change" for
              regional high school and  community college teachers.
