Abstract    :
                Plant science research at Colorado State University is emerging with a strong
              interdisciplinary focus on molecular biology.  A diversity of research projects
              targeted at both exploring fundamental biology and improvement of crops is
              integrated with graduate student training.  The Plant Biotechnology Program,
              which includes faculty from six departments and three colleges, and also
              interdisciplinary in scope and mission oriented in function, has generated a
              need for high quality greenhouse facilities with good control of environmental
              parameters that can meet NIH containment guidelines.  In order to produce a
              facility dedicated to support the needs of plant biotechnology research,
              funding provided by the Academic Research Infrastructure Program, combined with
              resources from the University, will be used to renovate a 30 year old
              greenhouse and adjoining headerhouse.  The physical condition of the fiberglass
              cover has deteriorated and considerable upgrading of electrical, ventilation,
              shading, insect exclusion and watering systems is needed. Capability for much
              improved control of environmental conditions, with the use of computer driven
              environmental monitoring and control systems, will be provided.  Once
              completed, the facility will have space for transgenic plants, with modern
              equipment for environmental controls and pest management. Research personnel
              benefiting from the renovation will include: 11 faculty members, 6 postdocs, 22
              graduate students, 15 undergraduates, and visiting scientists. This project
              will markedly improve the Program's ability to conduct reliable research and to
              train students interested in learning molecular techniques required for modern
              plant science research.
