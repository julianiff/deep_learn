Abstract    :
              Maricopa Advanced Technology Education Center     The Maricopa Advanced
              Technology Education Center(MATEC) will be operated by the Maricopa County
              Community College District (90,000 students), the nation's second largest
              community college system, in partnership with ten semiconductor
              manufacturing/supporting industries, including giants like Intel, Motorola,
              SGS-Thompson, and Microchip Technology; two Tech Prep consortiums with 13
              secondary school districts (60,000 students); Arizona State University, the
              nation's largest public university (43,000 students); three other Community
              College Districts (Arizona/Oregon); and Albuquerque Technical-Vocational
              Institute. Primary objectives are 1) to create new curricular systems/materials
              which reduce the gap between what is taught and learned in schools and what is
              needed by technicians in semiconductor manufacturing/related supporting
              industries; 2) to provide technical support, instructional support, and access
              to resources that faculty/trainers who are preparing students for careers as
              technicians need to ensure continuing relevance to workplace needs; 3)to
              increase the number of students, especially women and minorities, who prepare
              for and become employed as technicians in the semiconductor
              manufacturing/supportive industries. Targeted programs are Semiconductor
              Manufacturing/Processing Technology, Circuit Design Technology, and Facilities
              Maintenance Technology. MATEC's three components are: Curriculum/Materials
              Development, Staff Development/Support, and Workforce Development Support.
              Examples of strategies are Computer-Based Instructional Design System,
              Continuous Quality Curriculum System, Multimedia "Virtual" Materials,
              Electronic Resource Center/Form, On-line Q/A, Faculty Internships,
              Scholarships, and Workshops/Seminars for a national audience. Outcome
              evaluation uses gap reduction model with measurement instrument to be developed
              by American College Testing based on specific job profiles of skill levels
              necessary in workplace.
