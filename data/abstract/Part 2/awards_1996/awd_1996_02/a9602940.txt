Abstract    :
              Funding is requested for the purchase of a floor-model,  refrigerated high speed
              centrifuge and four rotors. The  centrifuge would replace the one preparative
              centrifuge  currently owned by Louisiana State University at  Shreveport, a
              sixteen-year old Beckman J2-21 centrifuge.  A high speed centrifuge is required
              for the routine  preparation of proteins, nucleic acids and organelles  for
              research experiments by six faculty members in the  Departments of Biological
              Sciences and Chemistry and  Physics. The centrifuge is also necessary for the 
              preparation of materials for graduate and undergraduate  student research and
              for laboratory courses. The  specific instrument requested is the Beckman
              Avanti  J-25I High Performance Centrifuge. Four rotors are  desired to permit
              necessary centrifugation procedures: a  large volume rotor (to hold six 500 ml
              bottles), a high  speed rotor for 50 ml tubes (to 75,600 x g), a low-speed 
              swinging bucket rotor that accommodates interchangeable  buckets and adapters
              for multiple purposes and a  swinging bucket rotor capable of forces to 26,500
              x g.
