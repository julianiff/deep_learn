Abstract    :
              9602244  This award renews support for a Research Training Group in  Ecological
              and Social Science Challenges of Conservation  first established at Cornell
              University in 1991.  During the  period of this renewal award, support by NSF
              will be phased  out as other sources of funding are secured.  The faculty 
              group is a mixture of 21 senior and junior investigators who  come from a
              variety of disciplinary backgrounds, but share a  common interest in the
              ecological, economic and social  aspects of conservation.  During the initial
              award, the  program developed new on-campus and field-based training 
              activities, including a graduate minor in conservation and  sustainable
              development.  These will continue during the  renewal period.  The funds
              awarded will provide stipends for  a postdoctoral student and for graduate
              students, will  defray part of the cost of  needed technical and 
              administrative assistance, and will help support an annual  field praticum in
              Central America that is a cornerstone of  the program.  One of the serious
              problems for conservation efforts is the  recurring cycle of poverty and
              environmental degradation  found in many regions of the world.  Common elements
              of the  cycle are population expansion which stimulates agricultural  expansion
              onto marginal lands, expanded fuelwood  requirements, and consequent soil
              degradation and species  extinction.  This training program will focus on two 
              contrasting socioecological settings in the Dominican  Republic and Costa Rica
              and will make use of existing  institutional arrangements and research
              activities.  These  activities examine demography and population growth, the 
              interaction of natural and agricultural systems, soil  conservation, education
              and management in biosphere  reserves, and related ecology studies.
