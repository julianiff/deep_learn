Abstract    :
                Funding from the ARI Program will provide Utah State University, with the
              opportunity to improve the Atmospheric Surface Layer Turbulence and
              Environmental Science Test (SLTEST) facility.  This unique facility offers
              researchers a permanent on-site infrastructure to accommodate multidisciplinary
              research and sustained field trials in the disciplines of engineering,
              meteorology, and environmental science.  Research conducted at the facility
              include critical areas such as: surface layer micrometeorology, engineering
              studies associated with high Reynolds number turbulent boundary layers,
              environmental testing, pollutant dispersion, and risk assessment
              investigations. Funds will be used to install permanent power, on-site
              microwave communications, and fixed equipment.  Collaborative efforts by
              scientists from various disciplines in academia, industry, and government will
              be enhanced by the project. The infrastructure upgrade will provide the
              permanent capability to explore surface layer phenomena and its relation to
              mixed layer dynamics in greater detail than at any existing facility.
