Abstract    :
               9602542   McCoy      Under this award, twelve American researchers will be  
              brought together in a workshop with Australian physicists   and mathematicians
              to exchange the most recent research   developments and to establish the basis
              for future joint   research in statistical mechanics and integrable systems.  
              The workshop will be held near Brisbane immediately   following the Congress of
              the International Association of   Mathematical Physicists. The principal
              organizers of the   workshop are Professor Barry McCoy of the State University 
               of New York at Stony Brook and Professor Rodney Baxter of   the Research
              School of Physical Sciences of the Australian   National University.
