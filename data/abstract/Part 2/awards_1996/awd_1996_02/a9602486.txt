Abstract    :
                This three-year award supports U.S.-U.K. collaboration  between Gerald J.
              Stubbs of Vanderbilt University and T.  Michael Wilson of the Crop Research
              Institute in Scotland.  the objective of their research is to determine the
              three-  dimensional structure of furoviruses in molecular detail.  The project
              is related to Dr. Stubbs research on the  structure of a wide variety of
              different, unrelated helical  plant viruses.  Furoviruses have unique genetic
              structures, viral host  interactions and transmission modes, and low levels of
              coat  protein sequence homology with other viruses.  Sequence  comparisons
              indicate that furovirus RNA binding is very  different from that of other
              helical viruses.  The  structures of these viruses will be important in 
              understanding the nature of host-viral interactions,  specificity, vector
              transmission, and protein-nucleic acid  interactions.  The U.S. investigator
              brings to this collaboration his  expertise in structural biology.  This is
              complemented by  the U.K. investigator's expertise in virology and his 
              research on furoviruses.  The project will advance our  understanding of the
              molecular structures of helical plant  viruses and will eventually be used in
              applied studies of  disease resistant plants.
