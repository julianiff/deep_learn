Abstract    :
                TITLE:   Advancing Scientific and Technological Education in American Indian
              Communities    This is a conference project which proposes to help promote
              increased involvement of Indian people in scientific and technological areas so
              as to improve the lives of native individuals and communities while also
              promoting their latent creativity in scientific fields and society at large. 
              The intensive conference on this topic will involve national Indian
              organizations, Native American community leaders and members, leading Indian
              scientists and educators, and some representatives of main-stream (i.e.
              non-Indian) science and technology organizations.  Focused, prepared 
              presentations at the conference will serve to stimulate deliberations and
              planning by small breakout groups.  Indian college students trained in
              facilitating group discussions will help catalyze those deliberations.  A final
              plenary session will consider and integrate the work of the small groups
              generating plans for partnerships of communities, national Indian
              organizations, higher educational institutions, and industry.  There will be a
              document of the proceedings of the conference with all of the recommendations
              and summaries of the presentations.  The conference is expected to be held in
              the fall of 1996 or spring of 1997.
