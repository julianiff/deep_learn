Abstract    :
              9602222  Sussman  This award provides additional support for a 
              multidisciplinary training research training program focused  on molecular
              analysis of signal transduction in higher  plants.  The effort was initiated
              with an award through a  competition sponsored jointly by DOE, NSF, and USDA in
              1992.  The program represents a joint effort of twelve faculty that  use
              genetic, electrophysiological, biochemical and  biophysical approaches to
              elucidate the mechanisms of the  initial events in signal transduction in
              Arabidopsis  thaliana.  Training is provided at the undergraduate,  graduate
              and postdoctoral levels.  Creation of the program  has resulted in several new
              courses and a new, weekly  research meeting that all trainees and faculty are
              expected  to attend.  The program has helped its trainees take a more 
              interdisciplinary and integrated approach towards a research  career in plant
              biology.
