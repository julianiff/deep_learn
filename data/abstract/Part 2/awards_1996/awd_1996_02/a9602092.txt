Abstract    :
              McAllister  9602092  Funding is requested to defray partial travel expenses for
              American scientists who wish to participate in the Tenth International Phage
              Workshop.  The workshop will be held in Salamanca, Spain from July 1-6, 1996
              under the auspices of the European  Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO).  The
              meeting will deal with fundamental problems in the molecular biology of
              bacteriophage and their hosts. Progress in understanding these processes at the
              molecular level has contributed greatly to advances in research in this area is
              therefore well justified.
