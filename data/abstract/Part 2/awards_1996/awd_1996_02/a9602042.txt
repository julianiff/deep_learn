Abstract    :
              Alan Taylor  Gerardo Paolera  National Bureau of Economic Research  SBR-9602042 
                This research will construct an economic history of Argentina in  period 1910
              to 1940.  This economic history will focus on three  major areas:  growth and
              structural change, income distribution,  and policy decisions on openness of
              the economy.  This research  is of particular interest because Argentina was
              one of the  wealthiest South American countries around the turn-of-the- 
              century, yet it was unable to sustain a period of economic growth  into the
              20th century.  As such, it is a classic example of  failure of modern economic
              growth.  This research will use  cliometrics (econometric models combined with
              historical  analysis) to attempt to unravel why this failure occurred and to 
              hopefully provide insights useful in modern day economies.
