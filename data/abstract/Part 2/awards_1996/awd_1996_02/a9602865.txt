Abstract    :
              IBN:  9602865  PI:  Saha    It is of great interest to neuroscientists studying
              brain development   and function to be able to follow gene expression which is 
              directed by the genetic code stored in each cell of an organism.   Presently if
              one wants to understand what part of the genetic code is   being used in a
              developing embryo of a laboratory mouse or what genes   are activated in
              response to varous pharmacological treatments, one   must sacrifice the
              organism and then use molecular biology techniques  to study the genes being
              activated.  This method is essentially taking only a   'snapshot' of the
              genetic processes occurring.  One then needs to  begin anew with another
              organism and hope to take another 'snapshot' at the   right time.  This
              proposed project will use new radiation imaging  methods that have been
              developed for particle physics research together   with techniques used in
              medical imaging to allow the neuroscientist to   image the gene activation
              patterns in an organism in vivo, that is,   without having to sacrifice the
              embryo.  This will  enable us to produce a continuous account of the genetic
              processes occurring   within the nervous system.  Our ultimate goal is to
              produce a detector system   capable of imaging genes during development and in
              response to various   experimental  pharmacological treatments --  a system
              which will eventually be  applied to better understanding and treating human
              neurological disease.
