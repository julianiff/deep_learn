Abstract    :
              Title:  Business Alliance for Advanced Technological Education      This two
              year project will establish the Business Alliance for Advanced Technological
              Education. It will develop school-to-work projects focused on technician
              education at four partnership sites: Siemens and East Wake High School in
              Raleigh, NC; Novell and Ford and the Virginia Beach Public Schools inn Virginia
              Beach, VA; Pratt and Whitney/UTC and the Manchester Public Schools, and the
              Hartford Community and Technical College in Hartford, CT; and Procter & Gamble
              and the Northern Tier Industry Education Consortium in Mehoopany, PA. The
              project is guided by a National Advisory Committee of educators, business
              people and policy-makers. The Alliance will be supported by an On-Site
              Assistance Group which will conduct site visits, provide technical assistance,
              facilitate cross-learning among sites, and ensure that worksites are connected
              with local postsecondary institutions. A Project Team will coordinate the
              development of curriculum and instructional materials, teacher and faculty
              enhancement and creation of technical experiences for students. Each year's
              activities are centered on a theme.
