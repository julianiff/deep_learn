Abstract    :
                The Albert Nerken School of Engineering, constructed in 1957, is one of three
              schools at Cooper Union.  The department's philosophy focuses on engineering as
              a field of study directed to the practical solutions of problems that effect
              contemporary life. Four traditional disciplines of study:  chemical, civil,
              electrical, and mechanical are included in the curriculum in conjunction to
              innovative cross-disciplinary fields, such as biomedical, environmental,
              materials, and manufacturing engineering, are integrated into the structure. 
              To assist the department  in achieving its research and research training
              goals, the National Science Foundation, in partnership with Cooper Union, will
              provide funds for the renovation of space on the sixth floor of the structure
              for environmental and bioengineering.  Currently, the laboratory is antiquated
              with inadequate ventilation.  Renovation will consist of asbestos removal,
              electrical and plumbing work, a modern HVAC system, and installing new fume
              hoods, lab benches and cabinets.  Space will be reconfigured to provide the
              department with seven laboratories dedicated to environmental and
              bioengineering research. Areas of concentration include: (1) asphalt
              technology; (2) soil/sludge bioremediation and treatment; (3) biotechnology
              separation research; (4) biomechanics; (5) room safety testing; (6) low light
              level microscopy, video imaging, digitization; and, (7) bioanalytical and
              environmental applications of a biosensor. Upon completion, this project will
              improve research capabilities by  fostering advances in urban environmental
              engineering, providing students with opportunities to learn new technologies
              for the 21st century, and encouraging interdisciplinary research.  Having a
              large base of women minority students, this project will attract
              under-represented students to these specialized fields of study.
