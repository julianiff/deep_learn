Abstract    :
              Schooley  9602148    Control of water balance and hemolymph volume are critical 
              components of insect homeostasis.  This control is believed to be  largely due
              to the actions of diuretic and antidiuretic homones on  fluid and ion levels in
              peripheral structures of the insect.   However, the nature of these hormones is
              unresolved.  Dr. Schooley  is isolating and characterizing the hormones
              responsible for fluid  conservation in insects and is defining their mechanisms
              and sites  of action.  Successful accomplishment of this project will further 
              our knowledge of insect fluid conservation mechanisms, whose  disruption
              represents a unique and effective method to control  insect pests.  The
              agricultural impact of these experiments is  immense.
