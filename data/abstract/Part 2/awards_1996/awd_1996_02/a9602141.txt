Abstract    :
              9602141  Edie   Description:  The proposed research  "Photoinduced Degradation
              in Doped Hydrogenated  Amorphous Silicon (a-SiLH)" is a collaboration  in
              condensed matter physics between Professor  Taylor, University of Utah and
              Professors  Mathur and Mahra, University of Delhi.  This  research adds an
              international dimension to  domestic research programs on electronic and 
              structural properties of disordered  semiconductors, and on the electronic 
              properties of thin-film photovaltaic materials.   The proposed research is a
              logical extension of  that research and will concentrate on the  photo-induced
              degradation and transport  properties of n-type doped silicon-sulfur  alloys. 
              Taylor has made significant progress  in understanding metal chalcogenide
              glasses as  a model system linking tetrahedrally-  coordinated amorphous
              materials and traditional  chalcogenide glasses.       Scope:  This is a new
              collaboration linking two  university research laboratories in the US and 
              India.  The research combines the expertise at  the University of Utah on
              growth, optical  characterization and magnetic resonance  characteriation with
              the expertise at the  University of Delhi on transport measurements  and
              structural measurements.  The research plan  is designed to make progress on
              ultimately  improving the stability of devices such as  thin-film transistors
              and solar cells.   ***
