Abstract    :
              9600195  Chomet  The 38th meeting of the Maize Genetics organization will be
              held at Pheasant Run Conference Center from Thursday, March 14 through Sunday
              March 17, 1996. This is a meeting which has been supported for most, if not
              all, of the years during which it has grown from a small group of dedicated
              scientists working with corn  usually meeting in a university setting, to the
              large numbers of attendees which now must be accommodated in a conference
              center. Many scientists working with corn gave their first talk at this meeting
              which covers both basic and applied areas of the genetics, biochemistry, cell
              biology and biotechnology of maize research. Students at all levels are
              encouraged to go and encouraged to interact with the established attending
              scientists.  ***
