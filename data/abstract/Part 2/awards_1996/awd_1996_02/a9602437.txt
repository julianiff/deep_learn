Abstract    :
              Advanced Technological Education in Chemical Technology    The American Chemical
              Society and the College of Applied Science, University of Cincinnati are
              developing a project to help provide chemistry-based technicians  ChT  with the
              education and skills required for successful high-level careers in laboratories
              and plants in chemistry-based industries throughout the United States. The
              mission calls for three goals:  (1) development of human resources so that
              chemical technicians possess the skills and knowledge required for employment
              in laboratories and plants that require ChTs to the mutual benefit of employee
              and employer, (2) creation of a system that effectively supports local efforts
              that address local needs, and (3) provision of a forum for employer, academe
              and community awareness of the roles and functions of ChTs, and effective
              information exchange among all stakeholders.    To achieve these goals the
              project is concentrating on three primary activity areas:  (1) facilitating the
              development of networked alliances that nurture and support ChT education at
              the local level and sharing of ideas and experiences at the national level; (2)
              developing and evaluating curriculum and instructional materials for ChT
              education; and (3) enhancing two-year college and high school faculty members
              involved with ChT education.
