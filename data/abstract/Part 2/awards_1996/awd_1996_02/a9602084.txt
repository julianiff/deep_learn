Abstract    :
                   The aim of this research is to clarify the conceptual  foundations of
              quantum theory through a careful study of the  principles which govern correct
              quantum reasoning.  A particular  focus will be the rules which determine
              whether or not a quantum  history--that is, a series of quantum events at
              successive times-  -makes physical sense.  Previous work needs to be put into a
               consistent mathematical and logical framework that will make it  easier for
              students to learn the subject, and aid in applying  quantum theory to new
              fields, such as quantum computation and  various problems in modern atomic
              physics.  It is well known that  the predictions of quantum theory violate a
              mathematical  condition known as Bell's inequality.  Situations where this 
              occurs will be studied to see whether the violation points (as  many physicists
              maintain) to the presence of mysterious long-  range forces in nature, or
              whether it simply indicates that  derivations of Bell's inequality do not
              conform to the rules for  sound quantum reasoning.
