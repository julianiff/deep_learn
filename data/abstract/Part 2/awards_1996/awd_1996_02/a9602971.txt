Abstract    :
              9602971  Reichl    This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative 
              research project between Drs. Linda Reichl, University of  Texas, Austin, and
              German Luna Acosta, of the Universidad  Autonoma de Puebla, Mexico, to study
              the quantum conductance  of the two-dimensional semi-conductor electron ripple 
              channel.  The primary research goal will be to calculate the  conduction
              properties of the rippled channel for the cases  of regular and chaotic
              electron dynamics, and to compare  these calculations with the conductance of
              classical  channels to determine the best materials for constructing  the
              devices in the laboratory.  The study aims to clarify  the dynamical origin of
              transport properties in open  mesoscopic systems, both classically and quantum 
              mechanically.    The research combines the expertise of the U.S. researchers 
              in classical and quantum chaos theory, and access to the  parallel computing
              facilities of their institution, with the  Mexican researchers expertise in
              condensed matter theory.  A  number of young  scientists and graduate students
              will  participate in the project and will be trained in  both  fields of
              physics.  ***
