Abstract    :
              INT 9602140  MacDonald        This U.S.-Czech materials research project between
              Dr. Allan MacDonald of Indiana University, Bloomington, and Dr. Pavel Streda of
              the Czech Institute of Physics will feature the basic physics associated with
              low-dimensional electron systems.  Specifically, the researchers will study
              equilibrium and transport properties of multi-layer electron systems by
              focussing on double-layer systems in zero and tilted magnetic fields.    The
              collaborative effort will build upon theories of inter-plane transport as the
              U.S.-Czech team attempts to define how the inter-layer correlations reflect the
              way the charge is partitioned between two layers where coupling effects are
              observed.  Results are expected to lead to a determination of the electronic
              structure of multi-layer systems subjected to in-plane magnetic fields and to
              contribute to a theory that can describe in-plane transport in the presence of
              a magnetic field, applied parallel to or tilted from the layer plane.  Such new
              knowledge of magnetoresistance may prove useful in fabricating semiconductor
              devices.    This project in materials research theory fulfills the program
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United
              States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and share research
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.     ??
