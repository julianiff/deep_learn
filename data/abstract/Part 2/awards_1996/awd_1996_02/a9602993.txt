Abstract    :
              9602993    Sites  "CONSERVATION GENETICS OF AMAZON RIVER TURTLES,     GENUS
              PODOCNEMIS (PELOMEDUSIDAE)."    The grant for cooperative research between Jack
              Sites of  the Department of Zoology, Brigham Young University, and  Craig
              Moritz of the Department of Zoology, University of  Queensland, Brisbane,
              Australia, will provide three  months of support for Dr. Sites in Australia as
              part of  a longer visit.  Sites will work in the Laboratory of  Conservation
              Genetics, with C. Moritz and N.  FitzSimmons, to learn methods of
              microsatellite  development and analysis for application to an  endangered
              reptile.  Sites will screen several nesting  rookeries of the Amazon River
              Turtles (Podocnemis  expansa and P. unifilis) for mitochondrial (mtDNA) and 
              nuclear (microsatellite) genetic markers to estimate  patterns and levels of
              female (mtDNA) and male  (microsatellite) gene flow within and between river 
              basins in the Brazilian Amazon.  Sites will learn both  new molecular methods
              which will strengthen his program,  and benefit from the pool of expertise
              available in the  Moritz lab, especially their experience in addressing 
              similar questions in marine turtles.  Moritz and  FitzSimmons will benefit from
              learning about the  application of their methods to a new species of 
              colonial-nesting turtle, and by extension to  conservation issues in the
              Neotropics in general.  Both  will also meet the Brazilian coordinator of this
              effort,  Dr. Nelson J. da Silva, who has secured government  permission for
              this project, and has collected some of  the samples.  Sites will prepare a
              full proposal for  submission to the National Science Foundation from these 
              data upon completion of his stay.
