Abstract    :
              9602932  Iwan    This award supports the participation of 7 US scientists in  a
              US-Japan seminar on Mitigation of Near-Field Earthquake  Damage in Urban Areas,
              to be held in Honolulu, Hawaii from  January 5-7, 1998.  The co-organizers are
              Professor Wilfred  Iwan of the California Institute of Technology and Professor
               Kenzo Toki of Kyoto University.  The objectives of the  seminar are to:
              identify and record the important lessons  learned from the Northridge and Kobe
              earthquakes as regards  near-field ground motions and their effects on
              buildings;  develop a consensus regarding the nature of near-field  ground
              motions and their unique effects on structures of all  types; provide guidance
              for the development of appropriate  methods to characterize near-field ground
              motions for the  purpose of structural design; assess the adequacy of current 
              mitigation strategies as they relate to the effects of near-  field ground
              motions; and determine future needs for  mitigation research and applications
              regarding near-field  ground motions.   Participants are among the most active 
              researchers in the area of earthquake hazard mitigation, and  this seminar is
              expected to establish and nurture  collaborative research between US and
              Japanese scientists  who will mutually benefit from these research ties.  ***
