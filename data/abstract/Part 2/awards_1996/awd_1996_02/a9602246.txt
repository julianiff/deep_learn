Abstract    :
              9602246  This award provides additional support for a BIO Research  Training
              Group in the Analysis of Biological Diversification  first established in 1991.
               During this course of this  second award, NSF support will be phased out as
              other  sources of funding are secured.  The 24 member faculty group  is drawn
              from 6 departments and 2 divisions at the  University of Arizona.  The funds
              awarded will provide  stipends for undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral 
              trainees, purchase computational equipment, and to bring  investigators from
              other research and academic institutions  to the campus for seminars. 
              University resources will  augment the funds provided by NSF in most of these
              and in  other categories.  Molecular, developmental, and population biologists,
              as well  as systematists, ecologists and paleontologists, have  developed
              distinctive approaches to the study of biological  diversity.  Owing to the way
              in which students have been  trained traditionally, the connections among these
               approaches have not been explored in detail.  While their  individual research
              interests are as diverse as the list  above, the faculty have formed this group
              with the aim of  using phylogeny, which can be viewed as the history of 
              diversification, as an approach to the integration of these  disparate
              perspectives.  ***
