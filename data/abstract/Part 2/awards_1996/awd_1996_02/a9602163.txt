Abstract    :
              9602163  Braam    This award supports the participation of 13 U.S. scientists 
              in a U.S.- Japan Binational Workshop entitled "Plant Signal  Transduction" to
              be held in Tsukuba, Japan on May 13 and 14,  1996.  Following the workshop, the
              U.S. participants will  travel to other institutes and universities to meet
              with  Japanese scientists with whom they share research interests.  The
              co-organizers are Professor Janet Braam from Rice  University, Houston, Texas,
              USA and Professor Kazuo  Shinozaki from the Institute of Physical and Chemical 
              Research, Tsukuba Life Science Center, Japan.  The specific  aims of the
              workshop are to:  (1) summarize the current state of knowledge of the 
              processes of signal transduction in plants; (2) identify key  questions that
              remain to be answered; and (3) propose new  approaches to address these issues.
               The long-term goals are  to create joint research programs between a cross
              section of  leading Japanese and American scientists that will advance  the
              understanding of how plants sense and respond to  environmental stimuli, and
              which will fulfill the objectives  of the U.S./Japan Program through the
              exchange and transfer  of scientific knowledge by international collaboration.
