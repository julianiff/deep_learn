Abstract    :
                Case Western Reserve University has made a major commitment to revitalize its
              Department of Chemistry. Funding from the National Science Foundation will
              enable the institution in this endeavor by renovating research and research
              training areas.  Currently the Chemistry Department is separated between the
              Morely Chemical Laboratory and the Millis Building.  Laboratories housed within
              Morely, originally built in 1908, are dilapidated, and would be inordinately
              expensive to rectify conditions due to structural and spatial constraints. 
              Constructed in 1962, research space in Millis has serious inadequacies as a
              site to conduct modern, sophisticated research in the traditional areas of
              organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry.  The project entails repairing
              Millis in order to consolidate the department in one building, thus
              ameliorating the dispersion and fragmentation of research groups and shared
              equipment.  Renovations include upgrading laboratory layouts to current
              standards of efficiency and safety. New air management and environmental
              control systems will improve air quality and energy efficiency.  Deteriorated
              fume hood, lab benches, cabinets, and sinks will be replaced or refurbished.
              Laboratory and access elements that are not fully ADA compatible are to be
              replaced, and a sprinkler system will be installed for fire safety.  Improved
              facilities will not only enhance the Department's  contributions to high
              priority  research, but it will strengthen training opportunities needed to
              sustain its recruitment of a highly qualified and diverse group of students.
