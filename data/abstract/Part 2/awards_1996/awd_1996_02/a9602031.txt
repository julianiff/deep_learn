Abstract    :
              9602031  Reisinger  This project is designed to create and analyze a dataset of
              legal orientations among legal specialists and the mass public in two
              societies, Russia and the United States.  Russia seeks to create a law-governed
              state through fundamental changes in Soviet-era legal institutions and norms, 
              The United States has a long record of comparatively successful rule of law.
              Democratic institutions, a market economy, or a pattern of peaceful conflict
              resolution have little chance of surviving without a general respect for the
              rule of law running throughout a society, from the highest officials down, and
              without a properly functioning judiciary. Judicial institutions will fall short
              of such fundamental goals as peacefully resolving interpersonal conflicts and
              protecting the citizenry from violence unless the cases they handle form only a
              tiny percentage of the potential cases. This in turn depends on most citizens
              respecting judicial institutions and the law.  Although much research has been
              conducted into the American public's support for judicial institutions,
              systematic empirical evidence of other aspects of the broader concept of legal
              orientations, especially with regard to legal specialists and elites, is
              scanty.  Methodologically, this project entails collecting and analyzing
              information about Russians' and Americans' legal orientations through a
              combination of quantitative and qualitative content analytic techniques. The
              documents analyzed will come from three periods: 1) 1980-81; 2) from mid-1988
              through 1990; and 3) 1992-95.  %%%%
