Abstract    :
              9602559  Das    This U.S.-Brazil award will support collaborative research 
              between Dr. Ashok Das of the University of Rochester and Dr.  Joao
              Barcelos-Neto of the Federal University of Rio de  Janeiro.  They wish to
              investigate the following:  the  Gelfand-Dikii formulation of the nonlinear
              sigma models  which would clarify various properties associated with the 
              system; two boson equation to 2+1 dimensions and study the  existence of a
              Miura transformation which would map it to  the Davey-Stewartson equation (They
              will analyze this  through a non-standard multicomponent KP system.); various 
              properties of dispersionless equations and their  supersymmetric counterparts;
              and the large order behavior of  perturbation theory at finite temperature.    
                     This grant will allow two well-respected researchers to meet  and work
              together at one of the strongest research  institutions in Brazil.  They will
              include a graduate  student from the University of Rochester to their team, 
              giving a young researcher an international experience, as  well as the benefit
              of working with two accomplished senior  researchers.            ***
