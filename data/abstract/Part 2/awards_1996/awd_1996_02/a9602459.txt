Abstract    :
              Improving Science and Engineering Technology Education at Community Colleges   
              Phi Theta Kappa, the honor society for community colleges, in cooperation with
              the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) is developing and
              conducting a multi-component faculty enhancement and curriculum development
              project to improve and strengthen the teaching of science, mathematics,
              engineering, and technology (SMET) at the nation's community colleges.  The
              project is accomplishing its goals through a set of activities designed to
              stimulate and assist other community colleges to replicate a set of effective
              NSF-supported community college curriculum materials and faculty development
              projects; thereby improving SMET education on their campuses and ultimately to
              two-year colleges nationwide through dissemination activities. The activities
              to be conducted include:    (a) Establishing of a corps of seven mentors drawn
              from NSF-supported projects at community colleges including Sinclair Community
              College (manufacturing), Eastern Iowa Community College (environmental
              education), Chemeketa Community College (sustainable resources), and Prince
              George's Community College (remote sensing, image processing, and geographic
              information systems).    (b) Conducting a national competition to select 14
              colleges to participate in activities listed below to assist them to replicate
              the selected NSF projects.    (c) Convening two National Science Education
              Conferences, the first to work with mentors to learn about the curricula to be
              implemented and prepare a plan to integrate these into their curricula and the
              second to report on progress.    (d) Publishing three networking newsletters
              and a final case study monograph documenting the work of the participating
              colleges.
