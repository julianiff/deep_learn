Abstract    :
                Contemporary Materials Science and Engineering spans a wide spectrum of
              topics, ranging from theoretical studies of the electronic structure of
              materials to the design, synthesis, and processing of advanced materials.  The
              faculty of the University of Minnesota's Department of Chemical Engineering and
              Materials Science has been productive in these areas of investigations. 
              Departmental research is conducted in Amundson Hall, a 1950's structure
              deficient of quality research space. Currently, rooms dedicated for research
              activities, are used inefficiently because of the interspersion of wet
              laboratories and theory space.  The shift in research emphasis toward
              experimental science has contributed to a mix arrangement of laboratory and
              theory space, which impedes the interactions of students with appropriate
              research groups.   Funding received from the National Science Foundation will
              be used to renovate existing research laboratories needed to enhance and
              consolidate research groups by function.  Renovations will include the creation
              of wet laboratories from theoretical and modeling research space. Laboratories
              for the synthesis and characterization of polymers, ceramics, and molecular
              materials will be equipped with chemical fume hoods and laboratory benches.
              Segregated instrument rooms will be designed to house materials
              characterization equipment, and scanning, tunneling and atomic force
              microscopes.  By altering the configuration of research space, efficiency will
              be maximized which will lead to increased productivity of faculty and graduate
              students, in addition to improved research training.  The project will enhance
              an already productive Department, and allow for the adaptation of new
              developments in Chemical and Materials Engineering.
