Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor David S. Perry and a graduate  student of the
              University of Akron to collaborate in  chemistry research with Professor T. R.
              Rizzo and his  research group at the Molecular Physical Chemistry  Laboratory
              of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in  Lausanne, Switzerland.  They
              propose to study energy  redistribution within energized methanol molecules. 
              They  will examine three different frequency regions by various  methods which
              take advantage of complementary expertise and  equipment within the
              collaborating US and Swiss research  groups.  Specifically, the fundamental
              regions will be  studied by direct absorption spectroscopies in Akron, and  the
              higher overtone regions will be studied by infrared-  assisted photofragment
              spectroscopy in Lausanne.  The nature and quantity of reagent vibrational
              energy has  long been recognized as a crucial factor in controlling  chemical
              reactivity.  Redistribution of vibrational and  rotational energy is known to
              occur on several timescales.  As energy is increased, the relevant interactions
              appear  first as discrete perturbations, then as clumps of  eigenstates, and
              finally as unresolvably dense contours.  This collaboration will study a
              particular system, methanol,  over a wide range of energies and time scales, in
              order to  improve understanding and discrimination of that range of  analytical
              responses.
