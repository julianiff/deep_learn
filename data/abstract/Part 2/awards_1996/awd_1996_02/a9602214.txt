Abstract    :
                Montana Tech of the University of Montana is the recipient of funds from the
              National Science Foundation to support the renovation of research and research
              training space in its Chemistry Building. Constructed in 1921, the structure
              has supported research activities for the Metallurgy, Chemistry and
              Geochemistry Departments for 75 years. Mission focused research and training
              have been a historical strength of the university, and Montana Tech's location
              in Butte, places it near the largest Superfund site in the United States.  
              This combination has produced a dramatic increase in funded research in
              chemical and biological remediation technologies and related scientific issues.
               Growth in interdisciplinary research, combined with research in the
              metallurgy, mining, petroleum, biology, and chemistry programs, has led to an
              increase of funding as well. However, because of the age of the facility, the
              poor condition and capacity of the utility infrastructure, and the complete
              lack of a modern ventilation system, research is hampered by existing
              conditions. Renovations will include replacing the original 1921 electrical,
              heating, mechanical, and ventilation systems. Poorly designed space will be
              reconfigured to comply with ADA regulations and allow for more flexibility and
              efficient space usage.  New fume hoods will replace the original building
              hoods, and a centrally located autoclave will be installed. Dispersed chemical
              storage will be consolidated in a centralized area that will allow for the safe
              storage and handling of hazardous materials and waste. Both the Chemistry and
              Biology Departments will share the facility, which will enhance existing
              collaborative research in biological remediation, and increase the breath and
              depth of the joint programs.
