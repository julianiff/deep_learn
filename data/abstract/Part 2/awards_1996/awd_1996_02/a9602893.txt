Abstract    :
              9602893  Hammock    Specific Degradation of Juvenile Esterase Hormone    The
              objective of this collaborative research project between  Dr. Bruce Hammond of
              the University of California, Davis and  Drs. John Oakeshott and Terry Hanzlik
              of the Division of  Entomology, Black Mountain Institute of Plant Production
              and  Processing, Canberra, Australia, is to examine the role of  specific
              uptake and degradation of juvenile hormone esterase  (JHE) in insect
              metamorphosis.  The investigators will test  the hypothesis that JHE titer is
              in part regulated by a  specific and efficient system for its degradation. The
              first  approach will involve the cloning and expression of the JHE  from one or
              more evolutionary distant species of insects.  A  second step hypothesis will
              be tested regarding uptake and  degradation based on a combination of chemical
              and molecular  approaches.  The long term goal of this research is to  expand
              our knowledge of insect development.  ***
