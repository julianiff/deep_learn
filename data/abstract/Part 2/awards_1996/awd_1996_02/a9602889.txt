Abstract    :
              9602889  Prothero    Under this award, Professor John Prothero of the Department
               of Biological Structure, University of Washington, Seattle,  will spend three
              months in Australia to amass a database on  organ and energetic scaling in
              marsupials as a function of  body size.  He will be centered at the laboratory
              of  Professor  T.J. Dawson of the School of Biological Sciences,  University of
              New South Wales, but will make extensive  contacts with colleagues throughout
              Australia. The database  will be used to test the hypothesis that metabolically
               expensive organs (chiefly brain, heart, kidney, lung,  skeletal muscle) in
              marsupials scale with body weight the  same way they do in eutherians, as
              determined  by regression  analysis.  Such data will contribute to an
              understanding of  the degree to which the same structural rules apply to all 
              mammals.  ***
