Abstract    :
              Environmental decisions require public participation and therefore knowledge of
              the ways in which the public values natural resources and the environment. 
              Contemporary techniques, such as willingness-to-pay and cost-benefit analysis,
              provide a narrow economic measure of value and consequently fail to include the
              emotional and moral content that is at the core of any value.  It is difficult
              to reflect public feelings about the environment and related policy preferences
              without careful elicitation of the emotional and moral components of value. 
              This project will develop experimental techniques for eliciting values embedded
              in narratives and discourse, and rich in moral and emotional content.  The
              values these techniques elicit will be compared to the methods and findings of
              other researchers interested in environmental values.  In a second stage,
              findings will be used to measure support for environmental action decisions. 
              By improving methods for values elicitation this research attempts to increase
              understandings of public support or opposition for actions concerning the
              environment.  Research results will be reported in publications in relevant
              scientific and policy-oriented journals; presentations at professional and
              publicly-oriented meetings and conferences; and the successful techniques will
              be incorporated into the applied research conducted by the research
              institution.
