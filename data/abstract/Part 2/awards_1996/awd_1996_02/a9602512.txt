Abstract    :
              9602512  Crowley    This Americas Program award will support a workshop on the 
              Foundations of Computational Mathematics, to be held in Rio  de Janeiro, Brazil
              on January 5-12, 1997.  The U.S.  organizers are James M. Crowley, executive
              director for SIAM  and Michael Schub of IBM-T. J. Watson Research Center.  The 
              Brazilian organizer is Martin Tygel of UNICAMP.        This conference will
              focus on a variety of topics in which  the computational process and the
              foundational mathematical  underpinnings of algorithms will be studied.  There
              will be  twelve plenary speakers, nine workshops and several  tutorials.  A
              second part of this proposal will involve  visits by Brazilian researchers to
              the U.S. to initiate  collaborative research in the subject areas.  Emphasis
              will  be placed on involving women, minorities and young  researchers.
