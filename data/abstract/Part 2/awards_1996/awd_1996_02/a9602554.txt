Abstract    :
                  The Oregon Institute of Marine Biology (OIMB) conducts  research and offers
              courses on the biology  of marine organisms.  Resident and visiting faculty, 
              postdoctoral associates, graduate students, and  undergraduates use the
              teaching and research laboratories  year round.    A seawater water system is
              essential to the function of a  marine station such as OIMB; it permits 
              researchers and instructors to work with live organisms.  Currently any growth
              in the OIMB programs  is limited by the amount of seawater that can be stored
              for  use in the teaching and research labs, and the  amount of wet laboratory
              space available for research  activities.  In this project OIMB will construct
              a 480  square foot wet lab annex to house new seawater tables space  and
              incubators, and a 30,000 gallon concrete seawater  storage tank.  This would
              allow an almost doubling of the  amount of seawater that could be stored, thus
              permitting an  expansion of research and teaching activities.  It would  also
              provide additional seawater table space in an aquarium  annex to be built
              adjacent to the research building.
