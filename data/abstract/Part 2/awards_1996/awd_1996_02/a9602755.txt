Abstract    :
                Funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will be used to
              support the restoration of research laboratories, shared facilities, and basic
              infrastructure for four basic science departments at the Johns Hopkins
              University School of Medicine.  The University has undertaken a multi-phased
              initiative for modernizing facilities dedicated to the basic sciences.  This
              project will support  Phase II renovations within three buildings of a five
              building complex:  the Woods Basic Science building constructed in 1961, the
              Physiology building constructed in 1929, and the Biophysics building
              constructed in 1959.  The three buildings share many deficiencies such as
              outdated infrastructure, particularly air handling, electrical and plumbing
              systems,  and substandard and dilapidated laboratory  and shared facilities. 
              Existing conditions of research space has affected research programs including,
              but not limited to:  computational biology, cell signaling, control of cell
              division, regulation of metabolism, bio-energetics of mitochondrial enzymes,
              studies of membrane transporters, pumps and channels, developmental
              neurobiology, molecular mechanisms of visions, and molecular biophysics of
              protein structure.  Upon completion, 19 laboratories and eight shared
              facilities will be modernized,  complying with  health and safety codes. 
              Improved facilities will  allow the Departments to initiate new
              interdisciplinary programs, retain and recruit the highest quality faculty and
              students, and sustain the highest quality of research into the next decade.
