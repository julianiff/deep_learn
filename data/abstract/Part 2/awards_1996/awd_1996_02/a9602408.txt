Abstract    :
              Title:  The Earth and Space Science Technological Education Project (ESSTEP)  
              The Earth and Space Science Technological Education Project (ESSTEP) will unite
              undergraduate faculty from two- and four-year institutions and secondary school
              faculty, with professional societies, businesses, and government agencies in a
              partnership to provide faculty in grades 8 through 14 with:  (1) hands-on
              experience in state-of-the-art data acquisition, manipulation, and presentation
              technologies for the earth and space sciences, (2) innovative strategies for
              using technology in classrooms and laboratories, (3) internship opportunities
              in earth and space science technology fields, and (4) improved access to a
              wide-variety of technology-based education resources. More specifically, ESSTEP
              will assist faculty in exploring ways that technologies such as the Internet,
              Geographical Information Systems, Global Positioning Systems, multimedia, image
              processing, CD-ROMs and laserdiscs can be used to enhance student learning,
              promote science and technology careers, catalyze the development of new courses
              and materials, and better articulate the grade 8-14 earth and space science
              curricula. Through earth and space science technology training institutes and a
              World Wide Web site, ESSTEP will directly serve 120 faculty during the next
              five years. These faculty will in turn provide in-service opportunities for an
              additional 1100 to 1500 faculty.
