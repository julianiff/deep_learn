Abstract    :
              9602172  Songer  The Appeals Court Data Base Project created an extensive data
              set to facilitate the empirical analysis of the votes of the judges and the
              decisions of the United States Courts of Appeals. Data on a broad range of
              variables of theoretical significance to law and social science researchers
              were coded. A major goal in the construction of the data base was to provide
              data over a sufficiently long period of time to encourage significant
              longitudinal studies of the Courts of Appeals. Thus, the data base was designed
              to code a random sample of cases for the period 1925 - 1988. The Appeals Court
              Data Base Project, as originally conceived, is nearing completion. The present
              proposal seeks to fund extension of the appeals court data base to bring it as
              close to the present as possible.  Such an extension would greatly enhance the
              utility of the data base for research and teaching by those who study the
              judiciary.   %%%%
