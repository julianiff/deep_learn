Abstract    :
              9602952  Kakac    This U.S.-Brazil Program award will support collaborative 
              research involving Drs. Sadik Kakac and Hongtan Liu of the  University of
              Miami, Professor Renato Machado Cotta at the  University of Rio de Janeiro and
              Professor Carlos A. C.  Santos at the Federal University of Paraiba to study
              heat  flow involving both smooth ducts and passages with arrays of  blocks
              simulating electronic components.  Drs. Kakac and Liu  will conduct the
              experimental investigation and Drs. Cotta  and Santos will do the theoretical
              studies in Brazil.  Dr.  Kakac has extensive experience in the study of
              transient  forced convection while the Brazilians' expertise is in the 
              theoretical simulation of different heat transfer problems  by use of a
              generalized integral transform technique.  By  joining efforts, they will work
              on an important problem of  heat transfer and develop recommendations to design
              heat  exchangers and cooling systems for electronic devices.    ***
