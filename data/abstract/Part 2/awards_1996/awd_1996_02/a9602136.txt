Abstract    :
              IBN 9602136    PI:  Elizabeth A. Connor    Neurons communicate with their target
              cells at specialized points of contact called synapses.  The coordinated
              maintenance of the synapse between a neuron and its target is necessary to
              ensure reliable communication between these cells and the normal functioning of
              the nervous system.  Though some synapses between neurons and their targets
              persist throughout the entire life of an animal, the mechanism by which neurons
              are maintained at synaptic sites is not understood.  The goal of this proposal
              is to identify factors that contribute to the stability of neurons at synapses
              using the frog neuromuscular junction as a model.  At the frog neuromuscular
              junction, a motor neuron forms a synapse with a target muscle cell.  The frog
              neuromuscular junction is a powerful system in which to study synapse stability
              since neurons can be studied in the absence of target muscle to reveal
              nonmuscle stabilization interactions normally masked in the presence of target.
               Further, the stability of target-deprived neurons can be manipulated to test
              for stabilization factors.  The role of a glial support cell, the terminal
              Schwann cell, in the stability and maintenance of the neuron will be determined
              by assessing the stability of neurons after removal of terminal Schwann cells
              from identified synaptic sites.  The ability of a neurotrophic factor produced
              by Schwann cells to rescue and stabilize neurons will be tested.  The role of
              connective tissue molecules found at or near synaptic sites in the
              stabilization of neurons will also be determined.  These experiments will yield
              new information on the mechanisms that stabilize and maintain neurons at
              synaptic sites and will expand our understanding of the molecular and cellular
              interactions that govern synaptic plasticity.
