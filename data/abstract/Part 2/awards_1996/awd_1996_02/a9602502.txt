Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Queens College will purchase a shared
              computer workstation and data storage system to support the research activities
              of Sociology Department members. Both data and facilities will also be made
              available to a wider group of scientists. The system consists of a DEC 500
              5/266 with peripherals and software, a EXABYTE EXB-10H tape jukebox system and
              a 9 gigabyte SCSI hard drive. The 9 gigabytes of hard drive space will make it
              possible to acquire and analyze large data sets.  The five core facility users
              employ a variety of computer based techniques that include the following
              elements: 1. the acquisition and analysis of very large and complex data sets
              such as current and historical foreign and domestic censuses and large
              longitudinal studies; 2. the implementation of recently developed maximum
              likelihood based statistical analytic methods; 3. the use of visualization
              techniques including three dimensional graphing and geographical information
              systems. Their studies are directed towards a number of socially relevant
              questions including: the career trajectory of men and women in science and
              engineering; math and science education of white, black and Latino men and
              women in the middle and high school grades; changing demographic patterns in
              the New York metropolitan area; change in occupation and income distribution
              over a long time period; the impact of immigrant streams on science and
              engineering labor markets; empirical analyses of success or failure of over
              90,000 union organizing drives; the impact of migration trends; intermarriage
              of various groups; historical changes with respect to the family; and the
              success or failure of coalitions throughout the US in combating substance abuse
              harm and use.  Each of these projects involves complex analyses on large data
              sets and the system provided in this award will permit the researchers to
              pursue their work with increased effectiveness. Queens College has a large an
              active Sociology Department with a large student enrollment. The
              instrumentation provided will assist faculty in their teaching role.
