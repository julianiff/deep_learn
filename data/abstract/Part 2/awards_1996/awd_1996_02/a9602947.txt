Abstract    :
              9602947  Mischaikow    This Americas Program award will support a collaborative 
              project between mathematicians from the  Georgia Institute  of Technology,  and
              the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de  Mexico (UNAM), on a study of theoretical
              and numerical  problems in differential equations.  Leaders of the groups  are
              Dr. Konstatin Mischaikow for the U.S. and Dr. Gilberto  Flores for Mexico.   A
              broad array of mathematical problems  will be investigated in the areas of
              ordinary and partial  differential equations, including  theoretical and 
              approximation aspects on inverse problems,  approximation  techniques in
              integrable Hamiltonian systems, elliptic  equations with critical Sobolev
              exponents, existence of  periodic orbits, and traveling waves phenomena.   
              Both institutions involved in the project have complementary  strengths in the
              areas of analytical and numerical aspects  of differential equations.  As a
              result of the collaboration  a broadly based scientific exchange between the
              two  institutions will be established that will significantly  contribute to
              the training of graduate students.  ***
