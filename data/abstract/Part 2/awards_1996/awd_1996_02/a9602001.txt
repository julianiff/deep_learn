Abstract    :
                    9602001  Guyden      The object of this research is to study the function
              of the thymic nurse cells (TNCs).  Thymic nurse cells are specialized
              epithelial cells that contain thymocytes completely enclosed in
              intra-cytoplasmic vacuoles.  The function of the interaction between TNCs and
              developing thymocytes. has not been determined, but is thought to be involved
              in development of specificity in the immune response.    The laboratory of the
              PI has been able to immortalize TNCs, and these cells can internalize
              thymocytes in culture.  These cells internalize double positive thymocytes, and
              a subset of these cells undergo apoptosis while another subset matures.  The
              latter rescued population is MHC restricted.  The proposed experiments will
              identify and isolate TNC specific monoclonal antibodies, and use these to clone
              the genes for target proteins.  The investigator will use these antibodies to
              see if they will block thymic selection and differentiation.  These studies are
              important to understand the function of these thymic nurse cells and their role
              in the development of the cells of the immune system derived from the thymus.
