Abstract    :
              9602967  Dieringer    This award will support a short-term visit by Dr. Gregg 
              Dieringer of Western Illinois University to Dr. Jose Garcia  Franco of the
              Instituto de Ecologia in Xalapa, Mexico in  order to plan research and locate
              suitable species for a  study of different adaptive responses by plant species 
              present in high elevation cloud forests and lowland tropical  forests.    It
              has been suggested that frequent episodes of moisture and  fog, characteristic
              of cloud forests, place severe  restrictions on the foraging activity of
              pollinators.  Compared with other lower tropical forest types, cloud  forest
              plant populations may exhibit a number or  characteristics that result from a
              lower pollinator  abundance. With this visit, the investigators intend to 
              identify species that occur in both montane cloud and  lowland forests.  These
              study species will then provide a  suitable base from which to engage in a
              comparative study of  pollination dynamics in different habitats.  ***
