Abstract    :
                Saint Joseph College, located in Connecticut, was founded in 1932 to assist
              women in obtaining higher education.  Constructed in 1936, McDonough Hall, home
              to Department of Natural Sciences, remains as initially constructed without any
              modifications.  Dedicated research and research training facilities are
              unavailable for faculty and students to pursue their research interests.  ARI
              funds will be used to convert an outdated laboratory into a modern
              undergraduate research and research training facility for students in Biology,
              Chemistry, and Environmental Science. An existing instrumentation room will be
              remodeled and reconfigured to accommodate additional research equipment. 
              Current spaces used for research and training activities will be relocated and
              consolidated in the new laboratories. Renovations will include the demolition
              and removal of all existing benches, fume hoods, sinks, and lighting, and the
              installation of new plumbing, ventilation, fume hoods, and other fixed
              equipment.  Interactive space designed for cooperative research will enhance
              discussions and facilitate multidisciplinary research among students and
              faculty. Both labs will be in compliance with ADA and safety regulations. It is
              anticipated that more students will be exposed to science as they see firsthand
              research being conducted in the renovated space.  Upon completion, it is
              projected that the number of students that can be accommodated in the new labs
              will increase three-fold. This project is integral to the Department's efforts
              in delivering a quality undergraduate research program, and will have a
              significant impact on the undergraduate research experience at  St. Joseph
              College.
