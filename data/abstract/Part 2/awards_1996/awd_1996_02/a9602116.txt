Abstract    :
              Daron Acemoglu  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  SBR-9602116    The first
              part of this research will develop a theoretical model  examining the links job
              mismatch, wage and income inequality and  growth.  With significant costs of
              finding the best job and  increases in the dispersion of worker skills, high
              skilled  employees will have a lower ratio of physical capital (under 
              investment) to human capital than low skilled workers.  With less  physical
              capital than optimal, wages of high skilled workers will  decrease relative to
              wages of low skilled workers, wage  inequality will be reduced and economic
              growth will be lower.   The second part of the project looks at the effect of
              public  education and redistribution of income on growth.  An empirical 
              comparison will be made between the U.S. and Great Britain,  considering
              differences in institutions in the two countries.
