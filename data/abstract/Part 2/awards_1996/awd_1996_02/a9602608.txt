Abstract    :
                Located in rural upstate New York near the Canadian broader, Clarkson
              University, founded 100 years ago, has earned a reputation for providing
              talented men and women with a  quality private education in engineering,
              science and management.  Although regarded as a small university, Clarkson has
              a large engineering program.  Presently, the School of Engineering is dispersed
              among two campuses in five different buildings.  This  arrangement has
              interfered with the development of interdisciplinary research opportunities.
              Sufficient space is now available to consolidate the entire School of
              Engineering in a single interconnected complex on one campus.  Funding from the
              National Science Foundation, with resources from the institution, will allow
              for the relocation to and renovation of research and training space in CAMP and
              Rowley Halls.  Underutilized laboratories will be renovated and remodeled to
              provide flexible and efficient usage of space.  Modern utilities systems will
              be installed, in addition to the replacement of workbenches and walls. The new
              building's configuration will maximize interdisciplinary contacts and
              collaborations, and establish shared equipment facilities.  This organization
              will eradicate any barriers that may have existed between faculty research,
              research training, and undergraduate education.  Creation of a
              multidisciplinary environment for research and research training will enable
              the institution to better prepare students to meet the engineering challenges
              of the next century.
