Abstract    :
                  The Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) will acquire  laboratory and field
              equipment that will  benefit resident and visiting scientists and the
              educational  program, primarily in the area of ecosystems research.  This 
              project addresses:1) the acquisition of  a state-of-the-art  sample combustion
              system for the existing mass spectrometer  laboratory that will allow rapid and
              relatively inexpensive,  yet precise,  determination of carbon and nitrogen
              stable isotope ratios  on biological samples as an analytical  balance
              capability to support the enhanced accuracy of  determination; and 2) a new
              small research  boat to support land-margins and marine field research.  These
              basic enhancements to the  capabilities of the MBL's Ecosystems Center will
              provide for  programs in ecosystems research,  and will prepare for the
              research and educational challenges  that are planned at the MBL  in the 
              coming decade.
