Abstract    :
              Title: A GIS Core Curriculum for the 2-Year College   An increasing number of
              Geographic Information System (GIS) technician positions are being created by
              industry and public sector users of GIS. Community Colleges are attempting to
              create GIS programs that will meet this demand. This project addresses the need
              for a supporting resource for the GIS curriculum design and course building
              activities taking place in a number of the two-year colleges. The National
              Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA) in collaboration with a
              number of community colleges and current NSF Advanced Technological Education
              Projects will develop a GIS Core Curriculum for Technical Programs (CCTP). This
              World Wide Web-based resource will support efforts to develop
              discipline-specific GIS materials by providing access to the fundamental
              elements of GIS theory and practice as they relate to efforts to provide GIS
              technician education in the community colleges. The CCTP will be patterned
              after the successful NCGIA Core Curriculum in GIS developed for university
              level GIS curriculum development and will also draw from the experience of the
              current effort to update and create a World Wide Web (WWW) version of the Core
              Curriculum in GIS.   NCGIA and an Advisory Council, including GIS specialists
              from community colleges, the GIS industry, and the GIS user community, will
              select GIS educators from the community colleges to participate in a week-long
              Work Session to create a framework for the CCTP. The framework will outline the
              essential units of material and a format for the CCTP. Following this session,
              each unit will be written by an individual with expertise in the unit topic.
              The completed set of units will be compiled as a WWW resource and will be
              tested in a number of community college GIS curriculum development and GIS
              instructional activities. Following a detailed evaluation from the sites
              testing the CCTP, it will be edited and made widely available via the WWW and
              CD-ROM.
