Abstract    :
                The University of Puget Sound, located in Tacoma Washington, is the recipient
              of funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program.  The award will be
              used to modernize biology  research laboratories in the 1967 Thompson Hall
              Science Building. Being the largest of the laboratory science departments at
              the institution, Biology faculty research is closely associated with mentoring
              student research. Research and research training, areas currently devoted to
              support plant ecology, marine phycology, molecular systematics, population
              biology, molecular biology and neurobiology, will be renovated.  Specific
              renovations will include: reconfiguring rooms to provide more flexible space;
              installation of fume hoods,  laboratory casework and benches; and updating
              utility systems. Faculty conducting molecular and physiological work will have
              appropriate bench space, support rooms, and storage facilities. Every
              individual will have the opportunity to participate in the scientific
              enterprise, and therefore laboratories will be accessible to physically
              challenged persons by providing low-bench and high-bench working spaces.  This
              project will enable all faculty to conduct year-round, unrestricted research
              where several students can work on senior thesis projects with faculty. 
              Expanding the breath of investigative training for the Department's increasing
              population of majors will expose students to the kinds of research that will
              encourage them to pursue graduate or advance technical training in science.
