Abstract    :
              9602962  Rojo    This Americas Program award  requests support for a 
              collaborative project between Dr. Alberto Rojo,  University of Michigan, and
              Drs. Carlos Balseiro and  Jose Lorenzana, Centro Atomico Bariloche, Argentina,
              to  conduct studies on two problems in the area of  correlated, disordered
              condensed matter systems. The  two areas to be discussed are the investigation
              of  disordered anisotropic superconductors and non-  adiabatic spin-phonon
              effects.  Both of them are  problems at the forefront of condensed matter
              theory.  The proposal outlines specific calculations on model  Hamiltonians
              which should shed important insight  into  the issues.    The principal
              investigators are well regarded condensed  matter theorists who have been doing
              important  preliminary work in the past in these areas.  They will  combine
              their expertise in this project , the work on  disordered superconductors will
              be done by Drs.  Balseiro and  Rojo, while the spin-phon problems will  be
              investigated by Drs. Lorenzana and Rojo.    ***
