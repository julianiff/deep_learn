Abstract    :
              9602985  Mitchell    This U.S.-Argentina Planning Visit will permit Dr. Charles 
              E. Mitchell of SUNY, Buffalo to go to Cordoba, Argentina to  work with Dr.
              Edsel D. Brussa at the Universidad National de  Cordoba.  Their research
              centers on the biogeographic  history of the Middle Ordovician graptolites of
              the Western  Argentine Precordillera.  They will test two different  models of
              plate tectonic history to help pin down the date  of the movement of these
              mountain ranges as they passed from  North America to South America.    This
              project will bring together two researchers who have  never collaborated
              before.  Mitchell brings his experience  on the systematics, biogeography, and
              biostratigraphy of  Middle and Upper Ordovician graptolites in North America
              and  Dr. Brussa his experience with graptolites and stratigraphy  of the
              Argentine Precordillera.  Their new collaboration  will further our knowledge
              in an important area of  geoscience.    ***
