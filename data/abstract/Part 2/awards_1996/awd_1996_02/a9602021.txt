Abstract    :
              Cost Allocation in Communication Networks  In hub networks there are a fixed
              number of interconnected facilities - the hubs.  Each hub provides access to
              the network to a given number of non-hub clients, locations or users.  Hub and
              spoke type arrangements by airlines are an example of such networks.  They are
              also commonly found in communications.  Hub networks are advantageous when
              there are economies of scale in provision of services as, when such economies
              exist, costs to each user of the network can be reduced through their
              participation and cooperation in the operation of the network.  For this to
              occur, however, users must receive their `fair share` of the cost reductions
              resulting from the exploitation of economies of scale.  In this proposal, the
              PI intends to develop computationally tractable means for determining  fair
              cost allocations among users of hub or hub-like networks.  Both game theoretic
              and heuristic approaches will be employed in the development of these
              allocation procedures.
