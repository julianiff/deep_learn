Abstract    :
              The Blandy Experimental Farm (BEF) is a 700 acre field  station, owned and
              operated by the University of Virginia  since 1926 for the purpose of
              supporting field research.  The BEF is not involved in agricultural research. 
              The BEF  preserves a diversity of habitats characteristic of the  Ridge and
              Province Region, as well as a diverse array of  successional fields. The BEF is
              unique among field  stations because of i) its proximity to the large 
              scientific community in the Washington, D.C. area; ii) the  presence of a
              large, and mature Arboretum on-site (the  State Arboretum of Virginia); iii)
              its proximity to a  large array of pristine montane and aquatic habitats; iv) 
              the ability of researchers to establish field experimental  plots/gardens in
              close proximity to greenhouse and growth  chamber facilities; and v) an
              extensive public education  and outreach program. Research at the Farm has led
              to more  than 70 student theses (25 in the last ten years). Thirty-  five
              research projects (involving more than 32 Ph.D.  researchers) have recently
              been completed or are ongoing.  The ability of the BEF to support new and
              ongoing research  is currently limited by inadequate housing facilities for 
              researchers.  This project will initiate development of a  new residence
              complex and construct two 2-bedroom  apartments for researchers.  Twenty
              different researchers  representing at least 22 separate research projects
              would  benefit from expanded on-site housing.
