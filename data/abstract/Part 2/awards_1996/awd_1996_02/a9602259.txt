Abstract    :
              9602259  This award renews support for a Research Training Group in  Signal
              Transduction at Iowa State University first  established in 1991.  During the
              term of this second award ,  NSF support will be phased out; it is expected
              that other  sources of funding will be secured during this period. The  13
              member faculty group is a mixture of outstanding senior  and junior
              investigators who come from a variety of  disciplinary backgrounds, but share a
              common interest in  intra- and extracellular signal transduction.  In its 
              initial year, the renewal award will provide stipends for  graduate students
              and postdoctoral trainees at levels  similar to the previous award and, in
              combination with  institutional funds will significantly increase the number 
              of undergraduate students sponsored for a summer research  program. and will
              defray part of the cost of the trainees'  research.  In addition, funds will be
              used to bring  outstanding investigators from other research and academic 
              institutions to the campus for seminars and symposia.  Signal transduction
              within and between cells is fundamental  to all types of cells and plays a
              crucial role in normal  cell development and function.  Examples of signal 
              transduction might include the cell-cell interactions  involved in development
              and function of the nervous system,  and the molecular mechanisms by which
              extracellular signals  effect temporary or permanent changes in the metabolism,
               gene expression or structure of individual cells.  Typically, studies of
              signal transduction are directed at  any of a number of levels of cell
              organization, from the  atomic to the organismal.  The faculty participating in
              this  training group study a variety of organisms using a variety  of
              biophyisical and molecular biological techniques.  By  integrating their
              research programs and training activities  in these various areas, the group
              promotes a cross  fertilization of intellectual and experimental approaches 
              that should provide a superb experience for faculty and  s tudents alike.  ***
