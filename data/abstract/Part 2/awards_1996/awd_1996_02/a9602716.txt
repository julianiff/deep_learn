Abstract    :
                Founded in 1905, Miles College, located in Birmingham, AL, is one of the
              nation's Historically Black institution of higher learning.  The College, in
              partnership with the National Science Foundation,  is the recipient of ARI
              funds for the renovation of research laboratories in the Taggart Science
              Building.  Constructed in 1965, the building houses the Division of Natural
              Science and Mathematics.  Except for minor modifications to the HVAC system,
              and making provisions for ADA compliance, no major renovations have been made
              to the facility.  Currently research activities are contained in inadequate
              facilities dispersed over two floors. The lack of adequate plumbing and
              electrical wiring, and the shortage of sink, hood, and bench space has proven
              to be a deterrent to research productivity.  Several projects are performed at
              neighboring institutions due to outdated research space. Specifically funds
              will be used to upgrade the HVAC, electrical, plumbing and lighting systems,
              install new fume hoods and cold rooms, and provide suspended ceilings in each
              laboratory.  Infrastructure improvements will advance biological and chemical
              research and training programs by strengthening the quality of research
              conducted at the College, and improving collaborative efforts with the
              University of Alabama at Birmingham. Because of its historical mission, the
              project will assist Miles College in its endeavors to increase the number of
              African American students who desire to pursue graduate degrees in science, and
              therefore increasing the nation's competitiveness in the science and
              engineering enterprise.
