Abstract    :
                Augsburg College's Physics Department has a long-standing research program and
              a strong record of preparing undergraduates for graduate study in physics and
              engineering.  As strong as this research and educational effort has been and
              continues to be, it is significantly hindered by the inadequacy of space for
              advanced laboratories used for research and research training activities. 
              Space used for research is scattered and suffers from general deterioration and
              inadequate electrical, cooling and ventilation systems,  limiting the
              effectiveness of the department's research program.  To remedy this situation
              and further strengthen the education impact of physics research, Augsburg
              College, with assistance from the National Science Foundation will renovate the
              ground floor of Science Hall for the department.  Constructed in 1948, the
              facility with its deficient plumbing, HVAC and electrical systems cannot
              support state of the art experimental work.  Current configuration does not
              comply with ADA regulations, thus limiting access to physical challenged
              individuals who are interested in conducting research.  By consolidating the
              department in one location, faculty will be able to perform research in
              Magnetospheric, Heliospheric, Atmospheric and Atomic, Molecular and Optical
              physics in a conducive environment.  Enhanced research opportunities will
              assure the professional capability of faculty and encourage collaborative
              approaches to physics research.  Increase training opportunities will be
              available for more students who envision a career in the discipline.
