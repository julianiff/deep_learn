Abstract    :
              Pac-Tec II: Pacific Technological Education Project    The future of the United
              States depends on our producing well-educated and talented science and
              engineering technicians. However, student interest in technical fields has
              declined; and students in traditionally underrepresented groups comprise 65
              percent of the student population, continue to be severely underrepresented in
              these fields.     The Phase I of the Pac-TEC Project is a grassroots,
              collaborative network of 24 faculty from eleven schools, from middle school
              grades through university level.  In Phase I of Pac-TEC , teachers are defining
              learning and teaching styles and preferences typical of many people in the
              underrepresented groups. From this definition, the project is building and
              testing solutions for classroom teachers--teaching methods that are inclusive
              but that do not require major changes in course content, but instead,
              revolutionize new teaching methods within existing content.    Phase II of
              Pac-TEC project is expanding the network of participating teachers and other
              professionals who together focus on disseminating working solutions. This
              project is also broadening its research, establishing a center that coordinates
              and disseminates information, training preservice teachers, presenting models
              for authentic student assessment tools, and producing a second edition of its
              innovative manual with national distribution.
