Abstract    :
              This award supports the participation of eleven US materials  scientists from
              eleven different universities in a US-Germany  workshop examining the frontiers
              of knowledge about the  properties of polymers and how to synthesize them.  The
              meeting  was co-organized by Julia Kornfeld of Caltech, Bruce Novak of 
              University of Massachusetts, Friedrich Kremer of the University  of Leipzig and
              Rudolf Zentel of the University of Mainz.  This  will be the first such
              workshop held in Germany since the  unification of East and West Germany; the
              siting of the workshop  in Leipzig was intended to emphasize the contributions
              to this  field that were stimulated by the blending of the two research 
              communities since that time.  The US and Germany are two leading  countries in
              the field of polymer science, and this meeting will  benefit both countries by
              fostering cooperation among the  talented participants who are all at early
              stages in their  scientific careers.  Polymers are highly deserving of special
              attention through  collaboration between world class scientists.  The demands
              placed  on molecularly engineered materials requires the use of polymers 
              possessing predetermined properties and behaviors.  Many  properties depend
              strongly on small variations in fine structural  features.  Architecturally
              well-defined polymeric materials will  play key roles in advancing existing
              materials and in developing  emerging technologies including optical fibers,
              electronic  materials and biomedical polymers.  This workshop will examine  the
              state of the art as well as areas for fruitful collaboration  in the areas of
              preparation, characterization and applications of  several classes of polymers.
