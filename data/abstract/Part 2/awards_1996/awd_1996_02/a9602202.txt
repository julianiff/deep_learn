Abstract    :
                  9602202  Davey    This proposal seeks funding for a workshop at California 
              State University, Sacramento which will convene engineering  faculty from
              several universities in the United States with  their counterparts from
              universities in Viet Nam.  The  workshop will have several objectives.  These
              includes  discussions of technical education in both countries  including
              possible student and faculty exchanges and a study  of potential areas of joint
              research as well as professional  society cooperation.    The workshop is
              planned for 5 days in November 1996.
