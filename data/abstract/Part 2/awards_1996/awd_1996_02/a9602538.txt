Abstract    :
                The Friday Harbor Laboratories (FHL) is a marine biological  field station of
              the University of Washington located in the  San Juan Islands at the junction
              between Juan de Fuca and  Georgia Straits.  There is an unusual richness of
              marine  life in the region attracting scientists in widely divergent  fields
              from national and international universities and  research institutions.   
              Topics of research range from molecular and cell biology  along a scale of
              increasing spatial dimensions to community  ecology.  Zoologists, fisheries
              biologists, oceanographers,  botanists, paleobiologists, and researchers from
              various  biomedical fields are frequent users.  Highest priority is  given to
              maintaining a suitable environment(instrumentation,  field biological
              resources, logistical support, housing) for  research involving marine
              organisms. Over 90% of the FHL  operating and capital budget is provided by the
              State of  Washington although over 2/3 of the scientific people whose  work is
              supported by FHL are from institutions outside the  State of Washington.   
              This will support a 2,700 sq. ft. laboratory for modern  biochemical and
              molecular research.
