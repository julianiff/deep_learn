Abstract    :
                This award will enable Seton Hall University to renovate chemistry facilities
              for two research groups in the Department of Chemistry.  The investigative
              teams conduct a broad spectrum of chemical research from fundamental organic
              and inorganic chemistry to applied research in biochemistry and materials
              sciences in McNulty Hall, the site of the renovation project.  Built in the
              early 1950's, laboratories originally designed as undergraduate teaching
              laboratories, as well as the other spaces in McNulty have never been renovated.
               Funds will be used to create to modern research facilities by  installing of
              new fume hoods and laboratory benches, upgrading plumbing and electrical
              systems, and configuring labs to comply with ADA regulations. Research
              personnel benefiting from the renovations include two professors, 10 graduate
              students, five undergraduates and one visiting professor.  The results of the
              renovations will be improved safety and working conditions of the research
              groups, allowing them to be more productive and to enhance all aspects of their
              research effort. Renovated facilities will provide better preparation and
              training for both undergraduate and graduate students at Seton Hall.
