Abstract    :
              Faculty Enhancement and Curriculum Development Activities to Improve Advanced
              Technology Education - Phase II     Rapid advances in technology have made it
              difficult for faculty in disciplines driven by advanced technologies to remain
              current. At the same time manufacturers recognize the importance of modernizing
              their processes to remain competitive in the global marketplace. The highly
              skilled workers that are needed to meet the changing demands of industries will
              have to be trained by community colleges or by industry itself. In response to
              this need, the proposed project seeks to improve the quality of advanced
              technological education provided by a consortium of five community colleges in
              southwestern Virginia    The primary goal of the project is to enhance skills
              and knowledge of the faculty. The project consists of four primary activities
              including "Back to Practice" experiences for community college faculty, a "Back
              to Practice" regional study and dissemination conference, Conference/Workshop
              participation, and faculty development summer workshops focused on enhancing
              the curriculum development and student assessment skills of technical college
              faculty.   The project will demonstrate that the individual strategies
              described in this proposal can be welded into a fully integrated process which
              assesses industry needs, relates these needs to required employee skills,
              defines the curricular material which establishes those skills, and provides
              quality training for students and industrial technicians in a timely fashion.
