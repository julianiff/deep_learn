Abstract    :
                Description:  This award supports collaboration between Dr. Khalil Najafi,
              Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of
              Michigan (UM), Ann Arbor, with Dr. Tayfun Akin, Department of Electrical and
              Electronics Engineering at the Middle East Technical University (METU), in
              Ankara, Turkey.   The research project has two parts: 1. the design and
              fabrication of a low-power high-precision interface circuit for capacitive
              pressure sensors, and 2. the development and testing of a wireless capacitive
              pressure sensor with a telemetrically accessible output signal.  Part of the
              design and analysis of the sensors and the necessary electronics will be done
              at METU, while the fabrication will be done primarily at the UM.  The testing
              and characterization of these devices will be done at both institutions.  
              These micromachined sensors and actuators and other microelectromehanical
              systems (MEMS) have many applications in biomechanics and in implantable
              devices, in industrial processing, automotive systems, avionics, and in 
              environmental monitoring.   Scope:   This award allows collaboration between a
              very active and well recognized group in the United States, at the UM, and a
              small, but promising, group in Turkey at METU.  The collaboration will be
              beneficial to the U.S. team because of the recent work by the Turkish scientist
              and his expertise in designing analog circuits and the necessary interface
              circuits.  The Turkish scientist and his student will benefit from their access
              to modern fabrication facilities at the UM.  The resulting enhancement of
              capabilities at METU will be useful in meeting research needs in the rapidly
              growing MEMS field.  This award is funded jointly by the Division of
              International Programs and the Division of Electrical and communications
              Systems.
