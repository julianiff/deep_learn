Abstract    :
              9614096  Chaikin  This proposal is for support of an international conference 
              entitled "Fluctuation mediated Interactions in Soft  Condensed Matter " to be
              held at Centre de Physique, les  Houches, France on October 14-18, 1996.  The
              idea of this  workshop is to bring together world leaders in the emerging 
              field of soft condensed matter physics to exchange recent  advances in theory
              and experiment and to introduce this new  discipline to young researchers and
              students.  The invited  speakers and scientific committee include many world
              leaders  in this rapidly developing area.  %%%  This proposal is for support of
