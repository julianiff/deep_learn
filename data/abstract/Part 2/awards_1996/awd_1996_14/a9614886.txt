                                        Abstract                                  HILDEBRAND,
              R. H.  AST-9614886      Funds will be used for a series of improvements to the 
              University of Chicago polarimeter, Hertz, which should  greatly extend the
              range of objects that can be  investigated. An undersized filter is to be
              replaced, anti-  reflection coatings are to be installed, an inefficient 
              polarizing beam splitter is to be replaced, and provision is  to be made for
              operation of the detector at a lower  temperature.  New, high-responsivity
              detectors are also to  be tested and a continuously rotating half-wave plate
              will  be developed to permit new modes of operation.
