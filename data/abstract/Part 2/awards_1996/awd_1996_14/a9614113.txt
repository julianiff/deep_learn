Abstract    :
              9614113  Roecker           This project involves a multidisciplinary
              investigation of the  deep structure and kinematics of deformation of the Tien
              Shan, the  largest and most active intracontinental mountain range in the 
              world.  The objective is to understand the dynamic processes  responsible for
              intracontinental mountain building, using the Tien  Shan as a laboratory to
              ask:  why and how such deformation occurs  where it does within continental
              regions, how such deformation  evolves with time, what bounds does the deep
              structure place on  flow in the mantle, and how do such possible flow and
              pre-existing  geological heterogeneity relate to the observed deformation of
              the  upper crust?      The project involves 6 separate disciplines of earth
              sciences, 8  institutions in the USA and involvement of scientists from 6 
              nations (China, France, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and the  USA).  ***
