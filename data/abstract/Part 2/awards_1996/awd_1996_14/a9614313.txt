Abstract    :
              96-14313  Brown, Slutsky, Abramson    The PIs propose to experimentally
              determine the elastic  anisotropy of e-iron at high pressures using Impulsive 
              Stimulated Scattering, a technique they are currently  developing for high
              pressure studies of opaque materials in  the diamond anvil cell.  The data are
              crucial for  understanding the physical mechanisms of the seismically 
              determined elastic anisotropy of the earth's inner core.  ***
