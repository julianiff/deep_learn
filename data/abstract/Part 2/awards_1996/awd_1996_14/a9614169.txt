Abstract    :
              Abstract  EEC-9614169  Nemhauser    This award provides funding for the first
              year of a five-year continuing award to support the basic research program of
              the Logistics Institute (TLI).  The Center was created in the fall of 1994 by
              the consolidation of the Material Handling Research Center (a joint I/UCRC
              between Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Arkansas), the
              Logistics Engineering Center (a research Center at Georgia Tech), and the
              former TLI (a continuing education Center at Georgia Tech).  TLI is currently a
              joint effort of Georgia Tech, the University of Arkansas, and 17 "Leaders in
              Logistics" companies.  The Center is involved in basic research, applied
              research, technology transfer, and continuing education.  The Center seeks to
              conduct research in following three areas: 1) Logistics networks; Logistics
              environments; and Logistics information and decision technology.
