Abstract    :
              9614350  Shearer    This research is to continue analyses of global seismic data
              sets  to resolve details of deep Earth structure.  These studies include  the
              use of broadband discontinuity reflections to examine details  of the
              topography, brightness, strength and sharpness of the  transition zone velocity
              discontinuities, stacking of short-period  data to image PKP and PKKP
              precursors and constrain small-scale  mantle heterogeneity and core-mantle
              boundary topography,  experiments in global event detection and location, and
              development  of unified models of 3D mantle structure which include 
              discontinuity topography.  ***
