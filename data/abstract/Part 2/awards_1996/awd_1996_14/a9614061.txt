Abstract    :
              9614061  Clark  The structure and dynamical behavior of liquid crystalline (LC) 
              phases will be studied using optical microscopy, light and x-  ray scattering,
              and scanning tunneling microscopy.  A principal  focus will be on freely
              suspended liquid crystalline films and  liquid crystals in porous media, with
              an emphasis on  investigating dimensionality, fluctuation and interface 
              effects.  The fluctuation, field and surface effects when  combined with the
              wide variety of order parameters and  symmetries characteristic of liquid
              crystals will provide a  special opportunity for observing neu phenomena.  %%% 
              The topics to be explored will have important scientific and  technological
              impact on areas such as liquid crystals for use  in flat panel displays, and
              the likelihood of the discovery of  entirely new phenomena will open up avenues
              of exploration for  other scientists working in areas such as condensed matter 
              physics and chemistry.  ***
