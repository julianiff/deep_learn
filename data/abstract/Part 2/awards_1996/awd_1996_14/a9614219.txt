Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT  EEC-9614219  Naylor    Microfabrication research is opening up
              new areas for specialized thrusts.  One such thrust is microfluidics which can
              be applied to miniature chemical analysis systems, micro-hydraulic actuators,
              precision fluid dispensing systems and microfluidic component manufacturers. 
              Research in this area will expand the technological base for many possible
              applications.  This planning grant will fund an industry/university meeting to
              determine the economic viability of forming an Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for Microfluidics at the University of Illinois at Chicago.   
              The research agenda proposed for consideration in the envisioned Center
              encompasses: 1) Packaging for microfluidics devices; 2) Integration of
              microfluidic devices with sensors; 3) Thru-wafer interconnects; 4) Microfluidic
              cooling devices in miniature high power devices; 5) Design and modeling of
              microfluidic components:  micropumps and microvalves; 6) Miniature drug
              delivery systems; 7) Miniature chemical analysis systems; 8) Fundamental
              studies of anisotropic etching for microfluidic components; 9) Optical
              monitoring and diagnostics for miniature fluidic devices; 10) Magneto
              hydrodynamic micropumps and solder dispensing with microfluidic devices; 11)
              Microhydraulic power systems; 12) Miniature NMR instruments.
