Abstract    :
              9614167  Pachavis    The symposium OElectrochemical Synthesis and Modification
              of  MaterialsO  is part of the Materials Research Society  meeting held in
              Boston, MA, December 2-6, 1996.  It is the  aim of the symposium to bring
              together investigators from  different communities to promote discussion of new
               opportunities and applications for electrochemical synthesis  in materials
              science, characterization of growth processes  and instabilities, and surface
              modification.  Over the past  ten years a variety of electrochemical processes
              have been  developed for the synthesis of novel materials and  structures.  In
              addition, the ability to characterize the  solid/liquid interface has improved
              with the development of  various in-situ probes.  It is now possible to examine
               surface phenomena with atomic resolution allowing detailed  mechanistic
              analysis of composition and structure.  The NSF  funding supports participation
              of student travel grants and  partial travel support for experts in the field. 
              %%%  The trends discussed above are being accelerated by the  increased use of
              electrochemical methods in commercial  applications. This Materials Research
              Society meeting is a  unique forum for exploring future opportunities in 
              electrochemical synthesis.  ***
