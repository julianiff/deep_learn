Abstract    :
              9613654  9614017  Duckstein  Bogardi  The project is directed to the development
              and testing of a  fuzzy rule-based model for predicting the characteristics of 
              regional droughts and floods under global climate change.  The work is divided
              into four tasks: 1) the construction of  the fuzzy rule-based model relating
              the time series of daily  Atmospheric Circulation Pattern CP types with flood
              events  characteristics and drought occurrence severity index; 2)  use of GCM
              based climate change scenarios to generate  possible future time series of CP
              type and consequential  flood and drought probabilities; 3) investigate the 
              uncertainties in the approach and the socio-economic  consequences of these
              uncertainties; and 4) develop and rank  robust mitigating actions.  The
              benefits from this research  are expected to be:  an easy-to-use model that
              will yield  time series of possible floods and droughts under climate  change
              that can be updated and coupled and can accept fuzzy  forecasts; and inventory
              of social and economic  consequences; an inventory of mitigation actions with a
               preliminary criteria ranking of these actions; and the  application of the
              model to the upper Rio Grande and the  Missouri River basins.  ***
