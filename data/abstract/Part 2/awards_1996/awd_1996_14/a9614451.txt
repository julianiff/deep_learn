Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9614451  DARBY  OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FOUNDATION   
              This project is designed to assess the magnitude and timing of the Arctic Ocean
              ice influx into the Greenland and Iceland Seas during the last 300,000 years. 
              Arctic glacial ice export and melting might have provided more freshwater to
              this region than previously considered.  Because freshwater is thought to be
              important in decreasing the formation of deep water, the thermohaline conveyor
              might reduce the northeastern flow of warm North Atlantic water.  This study
              will analyze ice-rafted detritus in well-dated cores from the northern
              Greenland and Iceland Seas, and match Fe oxide composition and grain
              lithologies to those from the Arctic shelves and land sources.  Correlation of
              these dated cores will enable a comparison to global paleoclimatic records and
              a better assessment of the role of the Arctic in global climate.
