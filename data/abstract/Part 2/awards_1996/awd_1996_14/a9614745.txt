Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT  EEC-9614745  GRAY    Since its inception as a formal program,
              one of the unique characteristics of the NSF IUCRC Program has been its
              commitment to a systematic and objective evaluation effort.  As it has evolved
              over the years, the evaluation effort relies heavily on standardized collection
              of data by independent on-site evaluators at every IUCRC Center.  The purpose
              of this proposal is to both support these evaluation activities and provide NSF
              with program-wide analyses of processes and outcomes.    An evaluation system
              built upon a national network of local evaluators requires a considerable
              amount of support and coordination.  Although the support and coordination
              provided by NSF staff and the "evaluators coordinating committee" are essential
              to the program's success, these mechanisms have not been adequate to meet the
              needs of the program.    At the current time, the IUCRC network of evaluators
              involves over 34 individuals representing over 55 Centers and approximately 75
              institutions.  This proposal has two primary objectives:  to support and
              coordinate the actives of the national network of the I/UCRC evaluators; to
              provide NSF with program-wide analyses based on data collected through the
              evaluation.
