Abstract    :
              9614763  Yuen and Vasilyev    The PIs propose to introduce newly developed
              wavelet  techniques to the modeling of geophysical flow processes in  multiple
              dimensions.  The project will include both  algorithmic development and
              geophysical applications in  convective mixing, viscoelastic flows in
              stratified media,  viscous heating, and thermal and thermal-chemical 
              convection. Results will help further the use of wavelet  techniques in the
              geosciences, as well as other scientific  and engineering disciplines in the
              area of large-scale  numerical simulations.  ***
