Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    OPP-9614503  MAYEWSKI, PAUL  UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE    This
              project will support the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) Science
              Management Office (SMO) and Science Steering Committee (SSC). The SMO will
              support the activities of the GISP2 SSC (e.g. workshops, planning meetings, and
              coordination with international science projects), publish a newsletter,
              promote correspondence of GISP2 results at national meetings and between PIs,
              facilitate logistical arrangements, and promote integration of GISP2 activities
              with other components of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program.  The SSC
              will conduct planning meetings for future ice coring research projects, appoint
              working groups to conduct workshops for development of science plans for new
              initiatives, and provide the ARCSS Program with an assessment on priorities for
              ice coring type global change initiatives/projects in the Arctic that are
              developed through the workshops.
