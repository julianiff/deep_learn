Abstract    :
              9614229  McMillan  This research proposes to develop and calibrate a new method
              of volatile analysis based on infrared reflectance spectroscopy, which will
              only require singly polished samples, and which does not rely on measurement of
              sample thickness for concentration determination.  Preliminary results show
              that the technique will work for CO3 and H2O species in the concentration range
              above ~0.1-0.5 wt% for basaltic compositions, and encouraging results have been
              obtained for CO2 dissolved in rhyolite at the 500-2000 ppm level.  These
              fundamental spectroscopic studies will be applied to several suites of samples.
                The results will be useful to workers in the fields of geochemistry and
              volcanology.
