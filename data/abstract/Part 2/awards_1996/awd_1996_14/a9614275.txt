Abstract    :
              96-14275  Levi    The PI proposes to obtain a detailed record of the Matuyama 
              paleomagnetic field, directions, and relative paleointensities,  from the
              Erk-el-Ahmar Formaiton in Israel, which contains the  oldest known hominid
              tool-bearing strata outside Africa.  This is a  pilot paleomagnetic study of 
              rapidly-deposited lacustrine  sediments which are expected to provide a high
              resolution record of  the Matuyama geomagnetic field that is suitable for: 
              comparing  secular variation and relatiave paleointensity of polarity 
              intervals; examining field behavior during successive polarity  transitions at
              the same locality; and testing the recently proposed  hypothesis of  intensity
              asymmetry across reversal boundaries.  The  PI also postulates that the
              detailed magnetostratigraphy will  contribute to an improved understanding of
              the timing and pathways  of the original hominid migration from Africa.  ***
