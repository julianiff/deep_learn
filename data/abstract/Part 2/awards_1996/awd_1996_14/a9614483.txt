Abstract    :
              9614483  Ritzwoller    This grant provides $34,500 as partial support of the
              costs of  acquiring a new multi-CPU server and peripherals for the  Geophysics
              group at the University of Colorado.  Specifically,  the equipment which will
              be purchased includes a dual CPU Sun  Ultra SPARC Enterprise 3000 server with a
              256 Mb memory expansion  and 27 Gb of mass storage to be used for
              computationally  intensive geophysical modeling and data analysis including 
              inversions of large seismic data sets, modeling of the anelastic  and elastic
              properties of the Earth's crust, lithosphere and  mantle, modeling of the
              geomagnetic field and mantle dynamics and  calculation of the effects of tides,
              earthquakes and isostatic  adjustments on the geoid.  Funding of this grant is
              provided  through both the Earth Science's Instrumentation and Facilities 
              Program ($22,000) and the Office of Polar Program's Geology and  Geophysics
              Program.  ***
