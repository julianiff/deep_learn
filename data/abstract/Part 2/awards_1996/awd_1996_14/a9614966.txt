Abstract    :
                   This project is being supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and  
              Organometallic Chemistry Program under the Research in Undergraduate   
              Institutions (RUI) activity, which is part of the Foundation's effort to   help
              assure a broad base for scientific research through enhancing the   scientific
              and technical training of students in undergraduate   institutions by involving
              them in high quality research.  This project   will involve the synthesis of
              electronically conducting organometallic   polymers, some of which may change
              their electrical properties upon   binding small molecules and so serve as
              sensors for these molecules.     Metallocenes with attached pyrrole groups will
              be used to form conducting   polymers of varying lengths.  A variety of
              analytical techniques will be   used to characterize the polymers and molecular
              modelling methods will be   used to correlate physical and electronic
              properties.  A particular goal   is to determine whether these polymers can
              undergo ring slippage to   coordinate small molecules, such as CO, in a
              reversible fashion that will   cause a change in conductance and so would allow
              these materials to be   used as sensors.       Undergraduates will perform
              multidisciplinary research supported   under the RUI activity with the goal of
              developing new conducting   materials as sensors for small molecules, such as
              carbon monoxide.                                                     ?%¢ />?
