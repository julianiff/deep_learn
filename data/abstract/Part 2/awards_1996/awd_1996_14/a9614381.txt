Abstract    :
              9614381  Spera  This project will focus on constraining aspects of the magma
              geneses processes at one of the most active volcanoes in the world, Mt. Etna.
              Specifically, the study will concentrate on investigating correlations between
              alkali enrichments and dramatic changes in Sr and Pb isotopic composition. To
              assess whether these isotopic changes are more reasonably interpreted as the
              result of crustal contamination or mantle heterogeneity, samples from six
              historical flows will be studied with a combination of crystal size
              distribution analysis (CSD) and microsampling of phenocrysts and
              microphenocrysts.  This technique will allow the documentation of how the
              isotopic composition of the materials change with crystal size.  Common
              isotopic signatures are expected for phenocrysts and matrix if the variations
              in the chemistry of the magmas is the result of heterogeneity in the source.
              Alternatively, changes in isotopic composition associated with different
              crystal size distribution of phenocrysts would imply the importance of crustal
              contamination as a petrogenetic process.
