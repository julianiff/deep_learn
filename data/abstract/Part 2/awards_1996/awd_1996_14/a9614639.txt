Abstract    :
              9614639  Lees    This research involves the deployment of broadband portable 
              seismometers from PASSCAL on the Kamchatka Peninsula to study the  effect of
              upper mantle flow around the sharp transform-to-  convergent transition in the
              Pacific/North-American plate  boundary at the intersection of Kamchatka and the
              Aleutian  Islands.  The geology of the Kamchatka region has unusual  features
              which may be related to asthenospheric flow around the  slab edge, such as
              exceptionally high rates of arc magmatism  involving both slab and mantle
              melts, and recent rifting and  spreading of the Komandorskaya Basin.  Using
              portable and nearby  permanent stations, scientists from Yale University and
              the  Russian Institute of Volcanology will investigate lateral  variations in
              seismic velocity, anisotropy and Q using shear-wave  splitting, surface-wave
              scattering, body wave reverberation,  attenuation and diffraction observations,
              and regional  seismicity.  They will address whether trench-parallel flow 
              exists below the Pacific plate, and whether Kamchatka volcanism  is underlain
              by a low-velocity, low-Q upper-mantle wedge  associated with mantle material
              pulled around and above the  descending slab.  Data from stations north of the
              Aleutian  intersection, where island-arc volcanism has only recently  ceased,
              will be used to determine whether a stalled, buoyant slab  from the subduction
              of the young Komandorskaya Basin exists, or  whether low-velocity upper mantle
              suggests the presence of a  "slab window."  Earthquakes in Japan and the Kurile
              arc have  ideal geometry for measuring crustal dispersion, and hence  crustal
              thickness variations, along the Kamchatka Peninsula.  ***
