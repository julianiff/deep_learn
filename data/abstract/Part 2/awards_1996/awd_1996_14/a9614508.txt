Abstract    :
              9614508  Graham  The long term goal of this study is to provide the geochemical
              framework to help detail the timing and the nature of the interactions between
              the mantle plume, the convecting upper mantle and the subcontinental
              lithospheric mantle during the evolution of the East African Rift. The
              preliminary data has shown marked geochemical differences between various
              provinces on the western branch of the Rift.  These differences can be related
              to the timing of ancient metasomatic events and to the development of
              isotopically-discrete domains within the subcontinental lithosphere.  Whether
              these isotopic systematics are a general feature of the western branch of the
              rift remains to be demonstrated. Continuation of this line of study will be
              done by analysing He and radiogenic isotope compositions for classic suites of
              the Toro-Ankole and Virunga provinces and by dating lavas from the South Kivu
              province where the largest variations in radiogenic signatures have been
              observed.  High 3He/4He ratios are known to be present in volcanic rocks of the
              Afar region and the northern parts of the main Ethiopian Rift and they are
              interpreted to reflect the influence of a mantle plume.  A second goal of this
              study is to track the effects of this plume signature in pre-rift and post-rift
              magmas of the southern Ethiopian Rift.
