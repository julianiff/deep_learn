Abstract    :
              9614924  Klavans  A major obstacle to the further development of digital
              libraries, and the  national information infrastructure as a whole, is the lack
              of adequate  means of providing digital objects on any basis other than free, 
              unrestricted access.  Publishers wish to specify terms of use and ensure  those
              terms are enforced (optionally collecting payment), before providing  valuable
              materials on the net.  While the latter topics are the subject of  much
              commercial activity, the former seems to have been largely neglected.  This
              workshop will attempt to begin a process of defining a common  machine-readable
              language for expressing the terms and conditions of use of  electronic objects,
              and more generally assess alternative frameworks and  means for the
              technologies of terms and conditions in a distributed  network-based
              environment.
