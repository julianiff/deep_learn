Abstract    :
                    9614118  Jacobson      The project is a study of the effects of aerosols
              and clouds on climate.  The research will be carried out with regional and
              global scale computer models that simulate gas chemistry, aerosol processes,
              dynamics, and radiation.  These numerical modeling tools are aimed at
              developing a better understanding of the effects of aerosols and clouds on
              temperatures.  The research incorporates a number of modeling tasks that
              include: (1) quantifying the overall effects of aerosols on regional and global
              temperatures; (2) studying the variations of aerosol composition and size on
              temperatures; (3) evaluating the effects of aerosols on vertical temperature
              profiles; (4) assessing the day and nighttime effects of aerosols on
              temperatures; (5) studying the direct effects of clouds on temperatures; and
              (6) comparing simulation results to data and other aerosol models.  Results
              from these modeling activities will generate new information that will improve
              aerosol and cloud parameterizations within climate change models.
