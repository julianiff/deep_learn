Abstract    :
              9614322  Nekvasil  Alkalic rock suites in oceanic and continental hot spot
              environments and regions of continental rifting appear to come from greater
              depths than the more common tholeiites.  Hence, they should contain important
              information regarding the physical and chemical conditions in the mantle as
              well as the processes that lead to hot spot formation  and rifting. 
              Elucidation of these processes  may be revealed by experimental determination
              of the compositional evolution of feldspars during fractionation of an alkalic
              basalt (hawaiite) from the Nandewar Volcano, N.S.W. Australia.  Additionally,
              other experiments will address the reaction mechanisms by which ternary
              feldspars adjust to changes in pressure and temperature.  The feldspars
              utilized in these experiments are synthetic ones produced in the basalt
              evolution studies as well as homogenized natural ternary feldspars from the
              Sybille syenite of the Laramie Anorthosite Complex.
