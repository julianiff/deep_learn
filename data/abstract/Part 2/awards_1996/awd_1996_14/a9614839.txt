Abstract    :
              Abstract  EEC-9614839  Magee    The Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center for Hazardous and Toxic Substances is a multi/university Center
              involving the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Rutgers University, Stevens
              Institute of Technology, Princeton University, and the University of Medicine
              and Dentistry of New Jersey.  This award provides funding for the first year of
              a five-year continuing award adding Tufts University to the multi/university
              consortia as a seventh division to study monitoring and assessment.  The Center
              has obtained an unprecedented level of success in its twelve-year history,
              generating in excess of $100 million in support of its programs.    The
              expanded research agenda associated with Tufts University addresses
              "IR/Fiber-Linked In-Situ Multi-Dimensional UV Fluorescence Spectrometer for
              Cone Penetrometer," "Field Portable Microwave Induced Plasma/Mass Spectroscopy
              (MIP/MS) for Analysis of Inorganic Contaminants," Electrochemical Sensor for
              Heavy Metals in Ground Water" and "Cross-Reactive Optical Sensor Arrays for
              Detection of Organic and/or Metal Contaminants."
