Abstract    :
              9614426  King    This project will involve the completion of the Principal 
              Investigator's scientific investigation of high resolution signals  of
              paleoclimate change recorded in Plio-Pleistocene sediments of  Lake Baikal. 
              The Baikal Drilling Project (BDP) is a multinational  effort (Russia, Japan,
              Germany, USA) to extract the record of  global climate change and tectonic
              evolution of the Lake Baikal  sedimentary basin.  Historically, the BDP began
              in 1989 as a joint  Russian-American scientific venture.  In January 1993, the
              BDP  team, in cooperation with the NEDRA Drilling Enterprise of  Yaroslavl,
              Russia, successfully deployed a light-weight drilling  rig from a barge frozen
              into position on the Lake.  With this  system, the first long (>100m) hydraulic
              piston cores were  successfully recovered from two holes in 354m water depth
              providing  climate data spanning the last 600,000 years.  In January-March 
              1996 technological improvements of the BDP drilling system made by  NEDRA
              enabled drilling to a subbottom depth of 250m, providing data  on climate
              change up to 4.5 million years ago.  Planned drilling  will examine the
              response of Siberia's energy balance to the  initiation and intensification of
              northern hemisphere glaciation (3  - 2.8 Ma) and the uplift of the Tibetan
              Plateau.  One of the  important hypotheses to be tested is the extent to which
              the long-  term climatic evolution of Siberia has influenced the distribution 
              of tundra and wetlands in central Asia and thus affected the global  methane
              balance.  ***
