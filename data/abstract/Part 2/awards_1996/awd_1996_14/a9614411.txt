Abstract    :
              9614411  Egbert    This is a collaborative project between Oregon State
              University and the University of Washington to acquire and interpret high
              resolution magnetotelluric (MT) data across two segments of the San Andreas
              Fault (SAF).  In previous work the P.Is. have used continuous MT profiling data
              to obtain high resolution images of electrical resistivity to depths of 4 km
              across  the Parkfield segment, revealing a narrow zone of anomalously low
              resistivity in the core of the fault.  In the first phase of this project, they
              will continue work at Parkfield, collecting additional profiles across the San
              Andreas Fault near Middle Mountain, to obtain a three-dimensional image of
              electrical resistivity in this area.  To extend the image to seismogenic depths
              they will take MT data at distances of up to  20 km from the fault, and will
              employ controlled source   exploration methods. In the second phase, a
              three-dimensional high resolution survey of the central creeping segment of the
              San Andreas fault will be conducted near Hollister, California.  Because the
              resistivity of crustal rocks is largely controlled by fluid content, these
              surveys will   allow constraints to be placed on the distribution and
              connectivity of fluids within the fault zone, and to show hmw these properties
              vary between segments with different mechanical behaviors. These results are
              expected to ultimately provide important information on the role of fluids in
              the earthquake process.  ***
