Abstract    :
              96-14179  Miller    The PI proposes an experimental and theoretical program to 
              determine the equations of state  of silicate liquids at high pressure to
              quantitatively understand  the formation of deep  mantle-derived magmas.  Shock
              wave experiments are proposed for  liquids that will lead  to equations of
              state for the partial molar volumes of the  important silicate melt
              constituents  SiO2, MgO, CaO, Al2O3 and FeO.  Complimentary molecular dynamics 
              studies will be conducted to estimate the shock temperatures, and  to
              approximate thermodynamic properties of the high pressure  shocked melts.  ***
