Abstract    :
              9613772  Nowack    This research involves the use of seismic attributes, that
              is,  wavelet amplitudes, weighted instantaneous frequencies, and phase  arrival
              times, from seismic wave  form data collected in the 1996 3-D Mt. Vesuvius,
              Italy, seismic  experiment.  The experiment was an international cooperative
              effort  of Purdue University, the University of Naples, Italy, and the 
              University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis, France.  The goal of this grant is to
              construct a 3-D model of the seismic  velocity and wave attenuation structure
              under Mt. Vesuvius.  Information from the model will be used to better
              understand the  earthquake tectonics and the source of magma for this actively 
              erupting volcano that sits in a region of high population density.  This
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard  Reduction Program.
