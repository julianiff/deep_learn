Abstract    :
              9614877  Shen and Jackson    The PIs propose to investigate tectonic deformation
              in China by  analyzing geodetic data from a many-station Global Positioning 
              System (GPS) array spanning a 500,000 sq. km. region in China.  The array was
              established by the State Seismological Bureau  (SSB) in Tianjin, China, and
              surveys have been conducted since  1992.  The PIs propose to collaborate with
              Chinese colleagues to  analyze and interpret these GPS data to provide  an 
              understanding of large scale deformation across eastern China,  and to provide
              a set of accurate fiducial station positions and  improved satellite orbit
              parameters to support dense regional  surveys.  The work would include
              technology transfer and  training in the use of GAMIT and GLOBK software for
              the Chinese  collaborators.  This proposal is linked to INT award 9602179, 
              "GPS Studies in Northern China".    ***
