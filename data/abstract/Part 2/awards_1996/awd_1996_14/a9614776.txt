Abstract    :
              9614776  Nabelek         This award will provide support to strengthen
              multi-national  collaboration for a project being planned to study active
              mountain  building along the Himalayan-Tibetan collision zone.  The project 
              entails extensive fieldwork in Nepal, Tibet (China), and India; and  will
              involve eight collaborating institutions from Nepal, China,  India, France, and
              the U.S., with the Oregon State University and  University of Illinois as
              lead-institutions.  An initial proposal  of this project was submitted to the
              Continental Dynamics program  of the Earth Sciences Division at the NSF in June
              1996.    Scientific aspects of the reviews were generally positive.   However,
              it became apparent that the international collaborative  aspects need to be
              further bolstered.  This award will support a  trip to each of the
              collaborating countries in order to clearly  define the responsibilities of
              each institution and to obtain  official documentation of cost-sharing from
              each country.  The  principal investigators expect the trip to result in a
              well-  orchestrated, multi-national collaboration, ultimately increasing  the
              effectiveness of the project while lowering the cost.    The Division of
              International Programs (India, Nepal and China) has  provided support for this
              project.  ***
