Abstract    :
              9614304  Collins  A plan for the dynamic mechanical testing (DMT) of the 
              promising new polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA's) will be  implemented.  DMT provides
              detailed information on polymer  structure and function, but has not typically
              been applied  to PHA properties.  A DMT investigation of the mechanical 
              properties of the Howard novel polyhydroxyalkanoates will be  conducted to
              appraise their industrial and medical  suitability.  Together with the promise
              of  polyhydroxyalkanoates as biomaterials, PHA's are tailorable  biomedical
              polymers, suggesting greater potential.  The  Howard Biomaterials Research
              Focus Group has developed a  novel protocol to tailor PHA properties.  %%% 
              This NSF Minority Research Planning Grant furnishes the  basis for DMT study
              and a later full-scale examination of  the relationship between the deformation
              and application of  these new polyhydroxyalkanoates.  ***
