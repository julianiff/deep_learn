Abstract    :
              9614783  Wyss    This research involves testing and development of the
              hypothesis  that the b-value, the Gutenberg-Richter earthquake frequency 
              magnitude distribution, is significantly different in crustal  volumes
              associated with volcanic magma chambers.  Small volumes  (radii of 1 to 3 km)
              with high b-values of about 1.7 are embedded  in background activity in the
              crust with b-values of about 0.8.  Under several volcanos, where the locations
              of magma chambers are  known from other evidence, the crustal volumes with
              anomalously  high b-values map out the magma chambers.  This work involves the 
              testing of this hypothesis and the investigation of other possible  causes of
              high b-values such as active dikes and magma vesiculation  along with their
              associated temporal variations.  This research is  a component of the National
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
