Abstract    :
              9614698  Langston    This research involves the use of existing teleseismic data
              sets  from the GSN and WWSSN to investigate the effect of 3D  heterogeneity and
              layered anisotropy on teleseismic waveforms.  Earthquakes, as a rule, occur in
              geologically interesting areas  with clear evidence of structural
              heterogeneity.  There is evidence  that near-source heterogeneity can have
              significant effects on  radiated teleseismic waves form earthquakes and that
              these effects  will map back into inverted source parameters such as the 
              spatial/temporal distribution of fault slip and source orientation.  The
              frequency dependence of the near-source effect will be  investigated
              theoretically for proposed structure models  constrained by detailed geological
              and geophysical studies in the  literature.  The teleseismic data from observed
              earthquakes will  then be modeled using forward calculation and inversion
              techniques  to determine source parameters and to determine the influence of 
              heterogeneity and anisotropy.  ***
