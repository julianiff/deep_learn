Abstract    :
              9614391  Gurnis   Subduction of oceanic lithosphere is , and well known around
              the world.  However, al subduction that is now current is relatively nature,
              and initiation of subduction is one of the first order problems remaining in
              tectonics.  This project will address through 3-D heterogeneous finite element
              methods two competing hypotheses for subduction initiation:  on stated by a
              very dense oceanic lithosphere sinking  of its own weigh, and one caused by
              longer distance plate convergence.  The results will be compared to geological
              observations in New Zealand, and will be important in understanding subduction
              processes in general.
