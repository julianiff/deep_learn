Abstract    :
              9614786  Yao    This project is composed of a 1,500 square foot permanent, and 
              traveling exhibit, and a schools program focused on problem-  solving, targeted
              primarily for children in grades 5-8.  The  exhibit includes a variety of
              classroom-tested puzzles, interactive  computer programs, and hands-on
              challenge problems.  These will  enable participants to try and utilize
              different problem-solving  strategies, and gain experience in spatial
              relationships,  communicating mathematically, and reasoning inductively and 
              deductively.  Materials produced include: Solve It!  Trunks, a  problem-solving
              program that teachers can use as a single unit or  integrate throughout the
              year; a publication which will enable  others to reproduce the exhibits; and a
              Guide with suggestions  about how to use the Problem-Solving Program.  Other
              activities  include Student and Family Problem-Solving Programs, and puzzle- 
              based workshops.
