Abstract    :
              9614004  Harvell         The project is supported as a high risk, rapid response
               project to investigate the causes and consequences of a  disease epidemic in a
              dominant soft coral (gorgonian) of  Caribbean coral reefs.  An apparent
              epidemic of unknown  cause is casing widespread but not total mortality in the 
              genus Gorgonia.  This rapid response award will allow Dr. to  attempt to
              identify the causes of the disease, the response  of the host gorgonians, and
              the efforts taken by the host  animal to establish resistance.  Diseases in
              marine systems  are very hard to investigate, the pathogens are difficult to 
              separate from secondary infectious organisms and the  chemical mechanisms of
              resistance are virtually unstudied.  Yet there have been numerous epidemics in
              dominant marine  species over the past two decades that have fundamental 
              influences on the underlying ecology of the ecosystem in  which the target host
              once existed.  This study, while very  high risk, may yield some new insights
              on disease vectors  and organism adaptations in the marine realm.
