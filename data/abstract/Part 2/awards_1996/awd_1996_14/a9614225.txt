Abstract    :
                    Abstract  ECC-9614225  Howes        As a National Science Foundation
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center, now entering its seventh year
              of NSF sponsorship, the Center for Grinding Research and Development at the
              University of Connecticut continues to focus its efforts in two areas:  1) the
              Grinding Center is making significant progress in fulfilling its mission of
              providing appropriate solutions and training for specific industrial
              applications in the grinding-dependent industries; and 2) the Center is
              pursuing strategies to strengthen and diversify its industrial sponsorship and
              funding base.  These activities are critical given the effects of the depressed
              economy in Connecticut and the substantial cutbacks in defense-related
              contracts to Connecticut manufacturers.    The Grinding Center increased its
              income to more than $2.7 million in 1995-1996 and has developed a $4,000
              square-foot complex consisting of a machine shop and laboratories for grinding,
              micro-machining, metrology, and materials  assessment.  The Center is
              continually updating and expanding its technical capabilities and resources.   
              This award provides funding for the first year of a five-year continuing award.
                Continued support for another five years will help the Center continue to
              serve its industrial sponsors and contribute to the resurgence of manufacturing
              firms regionally and nationally.    As part of the Centers efforts to promote
              international collaboration in engineering research and development, CGRD has
              helped arrange and is participating in the hosting of the International
              Manufacturing Engineering Conference (IMEC) to be held at the university on
              August 7-9, 1996.  The University of  Connecticut had offered to host this
              conference for the International Foundation for Production Research.  IMEC will
              have over 200 internationally recognized researchers, engineers, and
              professionals from the manufacturing field.  The conference is sponsored by
              NSF, ASME, and CIRP.    Additional funding is provided  in this award to cover
              expenses associated with the International Manufacturing Engineering
              Conference.
