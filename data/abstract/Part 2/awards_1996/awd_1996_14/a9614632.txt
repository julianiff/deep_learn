Abstract    :
              Abstract    OPP-9614632  PIELKE  COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY    This project is a
              joint project between Andrews and colleagues at the University of Colorado and
              Pielke and colleagues at Colorado State University.  It is designed to examine
              the role of lake ice in the arctic climate/environmental system.  The duration
              and thickness of lake ice cover in the Eastern Canadian Arctic is thought to be
              a critical component in the rates of sediment accumulation and primary
              productivity.  The work of this project will link current modeling efforts on
              the formation and extent of the annual lake cycle, a remote sensing component
              which will map out the temporal and spatial variability of lake ice on today's
              landscape, and a paleo component based on data from GISP2, Genesis modeling,
              and lake records accumulated previously by the PIs.  The PIs plan to use
              present-day climate data from stations on Baffin Island to forecast lake ice
              histories for extreme years and for average conditions.  These estimates will
              be compared with the results of mapping the pattern of lake ice disappearance
              and growth from satellite imagery.  The final element will be to use the lake
              ice model to generate a series of histories of lake ice given input from a
              variety of paleo perspectives.
