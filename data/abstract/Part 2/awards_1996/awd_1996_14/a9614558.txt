Abstract    :
              9614558  Wang    The PI proposes to experimentally determine rock poroelastic 
              properties by utilizing existing and newly developed  laboratory techniques. 
              The laboratory data are needed for  studying coupled stress-pore pressure
              processes in rocks,  which are important in applications in geophysics,
              hydrology,  and petroleum engineering.  An experimental database will be 
              developed to address the Biot theory premise that pore  pressure is not 
              coupled with shear strain, and experiments will investigate  the dependence of
              poroelastic moduli on pore pressure and  confining pressure, the general
              variations of poroelastic  moduli with rock type, and the relationships between
               poroelastic moduli and micromechanical properties. The  research should
              provide a solid experimental basis for  poroelastic modeling of geophysical
              phenomena in the earth's  upper crust.  ***
