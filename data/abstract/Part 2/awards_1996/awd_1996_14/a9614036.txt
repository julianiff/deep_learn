Abstract    :
               9614036 Williams  This Minority Career Advancement Award (MCAA) project
              addresses fundamental research issues of surfaces and interfaces in the
              epitaxial growth of III-V semiconductor materials as part of a collaborative
              research activity with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on free standing
              quantum wells.  The approach is to selectively etch compositionally modulated
              III-V heterostructures to produce quantum wells which are confined on both
              sides by air, vacuum or suitable filler materials.  Subsequent patterning then
              yields quantum wells suspended horizontally between vertical support posts. 
              This structure is conducive for probing local properties of solids, e.g., the
              interaction of quantum confined states with surface or interface states.  Also
              the inherent high contrast ratio between the barrier and suspended materials
              allows the construction of efficient mirrors for a Fabry-Perot cavity with
              dimension on the order of the spontaneous emission wavelength of the active
              medium.  Fundamental properties of these materials and structures as well as
              device configurations will be explored. %%% The project addresses forefront
              research issues in a topical area combining material science, physics and
              engineering, and having high technological relevance.  The research will
              contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to
              important aspects of electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuitry.  The
              program also provides for the integration of research and education through the
              training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant
              research area. ***
