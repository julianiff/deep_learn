Abstract    :
              9614934  Scott  When speciation occurs, different populations of a species have
              diverged enough that they become genetically isolated.  Males and females of
              the new species do not mate with each other. In this project a quantitative
              genetic analysis will show the genetic basis for variation in male courtship
              signals, which are pheromones, and female responses to the signals, between two
              strains of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. These two fruit fly strains
              have partial behavioral reproductive isolation and so are a good system for
              study of the earliest stages of speciation.  Specific segments of the
              chromosomes of one strain will be introgressed into the other and the resulting
              lines will be analyzed for alteration of male signals and female responses. 
              This approach will ultimately allow the identification of genes involved in the
              male and female components of mate selection.  Speciation is a basic process in
              the generation of biodiversity.  In addition to elucidating the early stages of
              speciation, this research is relevant to integrated pest management techniques
              using pheromones.  Knowledge about the fruit fly gained from this study will
              help to determine whether resistance to pheromone-based pest management
              techniques are likely to evolve in related pests, such as mosquitoes, medflies
              and tsetse flies.
