Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is radical kinetic and mechanistic studies.    Dr.
              Newcomb will carry out several projects that involve both direct,   laser flash
              photolysis and indirect kinetic measurements of reactions of   a variety of
              radicals.   One aim is to create kinetic scales for   substituted carbon
              radicals and heteroatom-centered radicals that   complement the highly
              developed scale for simple alkyl radicals, and part   of the work is directed
              at specific important targets such as the   kinetics of DNA radical reactions. 
              In addition,  emphasis will be placed   on studies of ultrafast radical
              rearrangements.  With this renewal award,   the Organic Dynamics Program is
              supporting the research of Dr. Martin E.   Newcomb of the Department of
              Chemistry at Wayne State University.    Professor Newcomb will focus his work
              on probing the kinetic and   mechanistic properties of carbon radical
              intermediates.  A better   understanding in these areas will lead to expanded
              methodology for   synthetic chemists and knowledge that will bear on a number
              of vital   biological processes.
