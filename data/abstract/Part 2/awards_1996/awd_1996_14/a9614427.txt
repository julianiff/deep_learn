Abstract    :
              9614427  Ding   This research project will utilize solid state sensors for
              experimental determination of thermodynamic data for neutral aqueous species. 
              This will greatly constrain our understanding of hydrothermal/geochemical
              processes at supercritical conditions in the Earth's crust.  Objectives of the
              proposed research include: (1) determination of association constants for HClo
              and NaOHo and (2) salting out effects on neutral ion pairs - HClo, NaOHo, and
              NaClo.
