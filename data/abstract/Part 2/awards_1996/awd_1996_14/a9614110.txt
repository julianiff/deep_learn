Abstract    :
              9614110  Nolet    This grant provides $46,764 as one-half support of the costs
              of  acquiring computer equipment for the Geophysics faculty at  Princeton. 
              Specifically, these funds will be used over a three  year period to acquire a
              SUN E3000 compute server will multiple  CPU's, expanded memory and mass
              storage.  This expanded  computational ability will serve four faculty and
              their graduate  students for a range of interesting and fundamentally important
               seismological research projects including, tomographic imaging of  the upper
              mantle requiring inversion of huge seismological data  sets, production of
              synthetic, long-period seismograms using  laterally heterogeneous Earth models
              to ground truth the validity  of inversion schemes applied to actual data sets,
              studies of the  temporal and spatial distribution of earthquake foci beneath 
              Kilauea volcano, Hawaii in order to better constrain the  mechanisms and
              conduits for magma transport, and visualization of  the kinematics of fold
              growth and fault motion in both 2-D and 3-  D using iterative restoration
              techniques based on high-quality 3-  D seismic data.  ***
