Abstract    :
              9614325  Hervig   This project will test two hypotheses: (1) that OH content in
              amphiboles, with constant Fe3+/Fe2+, is a function of the H2O activity in the
              system, and (2) that the oxygen content of the X-site of amphiboles is related
              to fO2 in melts.  A corollary hypotheses is that amphiboles record volatile
              activity in a way that can be recovered by micro-analysis.  The major elements,
              halogens, and H content of amphiboles and co-existing melt, will be determined
              using a combination of electron probe and secondary ion mass spectrometry
              micro-analysis.  The investigators will use samples from existing melting
              experiments.
