Abstract    :
              9614580  Nerem  This project is to develop a further understanding of the 
              biology of the vascular wall so as to provide guidance for  the development of
              tissue engineered vascular grafts for the  bypass and replacement of diseased
              vessels.  This is to be  done by reconstituting a blood vessel in culture from 
              vascular cells and extracellular matrix, and then evaluating  this
              reconstituted blood vessel in a laminar pulsatile flow  system.  A key question
              to be answered by this project is  whether cell-cell interactions, i.e. between
              the endothelial  cell and vascular smooth muscle cell, are required to create 
              a blood vessel with functional integrity, particularly in  regard to its
              endothelium.  ***
