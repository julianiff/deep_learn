Abstract    :
              9614730  Garver   Rates of tectonic uplift and erosion rates determine the
              topographic expression of an area undergoing deformation, but are difficult
              parameters to measure.   This study will determine the rates of erosion of
              active, rapidly eroding mountains by studying the sediments that are shed from
              these mountains.   In particular, apatite and zircon crystals will be collected
              from recent and relatively recent sediments.  Because of their uranium content,
              the crystals preserve the ages of their cooling which occurred during uplift of
              the mountains and exhumation of the rocks.  The study area is the Southern Alps
              of New Zealand, where recent uplift is relatively well known, and sediments are
              readily sampled.  Results are expected to help understand the role of erosion
              rates during orogensis in general.
