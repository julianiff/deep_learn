Abstract    :
              Abstract  EEC-9614159  Reid      This award provides funding for two years for a
              two-year phaseout award to Oklahoma State University's Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for Web Handling.  The goals of the Center are to:
              1) to advance the science base in the technologies of web handling through
              fundamental and generic research; 2) to assist in the transfer knowledge and
              information to the sponsoring organizations; 3) to assist in the transfer of
              knowledge and information to targeted Oklahoma manufacturing firms; and 4) to
              establish and maintain strong cooperative relationships with industry and other
              universities.    The Center currently has nineteen corporate sponsors each
              contributing $25,000 each year for sponsorship.  Over the ten year development
              the sponsors have played a key role in the evaluation of projects, the
              identification of new projects, and the advisement of the principal
              investigators.  Inputs are sought on a continuing basis from the IAB members on
              potential new projects.  A research needs assessment is conducted once each
              year.  Inputs from industry participants often form the basis of new project
              proposal s at subsequent meetings, as well as changes in the scope of
              continuing projects.
