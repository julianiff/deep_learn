Abstract    :
              9614920  Hesterberg  The geochemical evolution of heavy metal speciation in the
              weathering environment of a contaminated soil determines the long-term fate of
              metals.  The goal of this basic research program is to understand at the
              molecular level the binding of copper (II) and arsenate in an organo-mineral
              model system comprising an aqueous mixture of goethite and humic acid extracted
              from natural organic matter.  Macroscopic solubility studies have shown that
              the adsorption of metals in organo-mineral systems is not always described by
              linearly combining contributions from each of the mineral adsorbents - humic
              acid and oxide mineral.  Synchrotron XAS, particularly extended x-ray
              absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and x-ray absorption near edge
              (XANES) spectroscopy, will be used as a primary tool to determine the nature of
               Cu (II) and AsO4 binding on goethite containing surface-adsorbed humic acid.
