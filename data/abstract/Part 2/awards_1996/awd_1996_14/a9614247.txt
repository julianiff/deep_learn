Abstract    :
              9614247  Garcia  This is a proposal to continue work on the petrology and
              geochemistry of lavas from Kilauea volcano in Hawaii to improve our
              understanding of magmatic processes within active basaltic volcanoes.  Recent
              work has documented large, systematic compositional variations within the
              historical lavas of this volcano (~200 years).  The variation observed appears
              to be cyclic and correlated with summit explosions.  The main purpose of this
              study will be to determine the cause of this compositional variation and to
              evaluate the relative importance of imputs from crustal and mantle processes.
              The working hypothesis is that the long-term geochemical cycle observed in
              Kilauea is caused by the dynamic melting of a heterogeneous plume source
              followed by mixing in the shallow summit magma reservoir.  Inflections in the
              cycles occur when the summit reservoir is extensively drained during explosive
              events.  Continuation of the study will allow the monitoring of the
              compositional variations in the ongoing Puu Oo eruption and the evaluation of
              the extent of crustal contamination in the Kilauea lavas.  In addition, the
              proposed work will seek to provide insights into factors that may control the
              geochemical variation at Kilauea such as the role of explosive events, the
              relative effects of mantle heterogeneity and changes in the extent of partial
              melting and shape of melting regions.
