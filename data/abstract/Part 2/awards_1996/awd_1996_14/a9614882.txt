Abstract    :
              9614882  Urban    The overall objective of this research is to investigate  thin
              film materials deposited from beams of nanoparticles  (clusters), a fraction of
              which may be ionized and  accelerated to the growing surface.  There are three
              focus  areas:   synthesis of intense nanoparticle beams, nucleation  and growth
              of thin films deposited from nanoparticle beams,  and the modeling of both
              particle synthesis and subsequent  film growth.  In the area of synthesis, the
              objectives are  to explore the limitations of the pure expansion method and 
              build two new sources, using simple vaporization with gas  aggregation and
              magnetron sputtering with gas-assisted  aggregation.  The prime objective in
              the thin film materials  properties area is to fabricate films and investigate 
              nanophase dependent properties of materials including  magnetic and
              semiconductor materials.  A second objective is  to investigate films in which
              the nanoparticles are  exploited to influence the film (microstructure, surface
               roughness, density, stresses, etc.) without preserving the  particles, but
              rather by taking advantage of super-thermal  condensation and transport
              properties of the beams of  incident particles.  The final focus area improves 
              mathematical models of the nanoparticle synthesis process  and the phenomena
              occurring as they arrive at the growing  surface.  This is carried out using
              existing molecular  dynamics simulations.  %%%  This research has a direct
              impact on materials science, both  in the development of nanophase thin films
              and in obtaining  other novel film microstructures resulting from the unique 
              transport, nucleation, and film growth mechanisms connected  with nanoparticle
              depositing beams.  ***
