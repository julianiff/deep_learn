Abstract    :
              9614633  Lindsay    Through a collaboration of the DuPage Children's Museum,
              Argonne  National Laboratory, and National-Louis University, a three-element 
              project is being conducted focusing on the following: 1) a research  component
              that studies children's naive perceptions of the  phenomena of air and wind
              energy, 2) an exhibition component that  uses the project research to design,
              develop, and construct a 3-  4,000 square foot "process" oriented exhibition
              with a 2-story  exhibit tower and 12-15 replicable exploratory workstations, 3)
              a  program component that offers explorations for children adapted for 
              museums, preschools and elementary school classrooms.  Target  audiences
              include young children and their parents, pre- and in-  service early childhood
              teachers, and museum professionals  interested in reaching very young children.
