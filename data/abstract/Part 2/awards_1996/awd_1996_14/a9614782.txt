Abstract    :
              9614782  Langmuir  Convergent plate margins play a key role in the solid earth
              geochemical cycle, as the setting where new continental crust is created and
              oceanic lithosphere is recycled into the mantle.  The petrogenetic processes
              involved in the origin of magmas in oceanic arcs, where the overlying crust is
              thin, are better understood than those in continental arcs where the overlying
              crust is much thicker.  The primary goal of this proposal will be to identify
              the processes responsible for the thick crust geochemical signature that is
              often seen in convergent plate margin magmatism.  It is proposed to use the
              eastern Mexican volcanic belt as a test locality because the lavas in this
              continental arc have thick crust characteristics and contain a large number and
              range of mafic compositions.  The analytical approach will include
              high-precision trace element and isotope analyses (Sr, Nd, Pb and He) of the
              mafic rocks in order to obtain the combination of geochemical parameters that
              are most sensitive to the addition of subducted sediments, melting of the
              mantle wedge and crustal processing.  This approach will hopefully allow the
              distinction between the various hypotheses currently invoked for the thick
              crust signature in continental arcs.
