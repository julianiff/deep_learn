Abstract    :
              9614675  Mueller   Two important deterrents limit our understanding  of shallow
              crustal deformation as well as its relationship to active seismicity. They are
              the lack of knowledge of the time frame of earthquake  events, and  the role of
              faulting that is totally subsurface, that is , faults that never break through
              to the surface. This project will examine  folds that form above unexposed
              (blind) faults in southern California by studying    1  landforms on hills that
              are produced by active folding,   2  young surficial deposits, and  3 
              subsurface  structure using data from oil wells.  Geomorphic structures that
              may be related to seismic deformation will be dated by isotopic methods, and
              then compared to historic and extrapolated earthquake frequency patterns.   
              Together these results are expected to be useful in evaluating the potential
              relationships among several types of land forms, and seismicity on blind
              structures.
