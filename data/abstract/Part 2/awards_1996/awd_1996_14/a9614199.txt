Abstract    :
              9614199  Wiens    This grant provides $34,203 as one-half support of the costs
              of  upgrading five workstations presently used by seismologists at  Washington
              University.  Specifically, their present SUN SS1, IPC  and S10 will be upgraded
              with the SUN ULTRA 170 CPU, additional  memory, SCSI internal hard disks and
              20" color monitors.  A  variety of computationally intensive studies that are
              both  interesting and fundamental problems in seismology and geophysics  will
              utilize the capabilities of these upgraded workstations  including, 3-D seismic
              tomography of subducted oceanic  lithosphere beneath the Tonga trench,
              thermodynamic and seismic  modeling of the Tonga slab using finite difference
              techniques and  equations of state to locate possible depths of the
              olive-spinel  phase transformation, studies of the distribution and frequency 
              of aftershocks following the 1994 deep focus Tonga earthquake to  look for
              clues as to the mechanisms behind deep-focus earthquakes  (i.e. phase
              transformations, dehydration reactions), imaging of  the structure of the
              core-mantle boundary through compressional  wave mapping, imaging of the
              lateral and radial shear wave  velocity structure of the lowermost mantle,
              generation of  synthetic seismograms for visualization of seismic wave 
              propagation through the Earth from crust to core and studies of  the seismic
              velocity distribution in areas surrounding shallow  faults.  ***
