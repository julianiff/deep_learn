              Retention of Under represented Minority Students in Engineering: A Longitudinal
              Study at Seven Sites    Amount:  $1,867,833     Submitted by NACME to establish
              the relative importance of factors that will improve the retention of under
              represented minority undergraduate engineering students. It further sought to
              clarify the factors that contribute to the retention of particular ethnic or
              racial groups and which apply to most or all minority engineering students. The
              study hypothesis was that policy implications required change in the culture of
              institutions of engineering. The goals of the  study were to understand the
              processes of minority retention, to provide      information on the mechanisms
              that enable changes in policies and practices, and to generalize to a broader
              policy for other engineering programs in higher education.
