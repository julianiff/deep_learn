Abstract    :
              9614531  Angell    This focus of this investigation of glasses and amorphous
              liquids  is on five broad areas:  polyamorphic transitions and  possible 
              connections with biopolymers;  studies of microemulsion systems  with an
              emphasis on glass-forming microemulsions;  studies of  Vogel-Fucher deviations
              in thermodynamic properties;  studies of  molecules which may exhibit two-state
              complexity;  and  destablization  of the crystal phase by electrochemical
              methods,  and by crystal desolvation.  %%%  The amorphous state of solids is
              central to many areas of  advanced materials technologies involving areas such
              as polymers,  ceramics, metals and pharmaceuticals.  Research investigations 
              such as this aimed at describing at the molecular level the  nature of the
              amorphous state and how it is prepared and  stabilized will lead possibly to
              new routes for synthesizing new  materials with unique properties.  ***
