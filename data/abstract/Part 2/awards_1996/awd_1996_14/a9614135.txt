Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    OPP-9614135  WELLER, GUNTER  UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA    This is a
              project to support the Land-Atmosphere-Ice Interactions (LAII)  Science
              Management Office (SMO) and Science Steering Committee (SSC). The SMO will
              support the activities of the LAII SSC (e.g. workshops, planning meetings, and
              coordination with international science projects), publish a newsletter,
              promote correspondence of LAII results at national meetings and between PIs,
              facilitate logistical arrangements, and promote integration of LAII activities
              with other components of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program.  The SSC
              will conduct planning meetings for future LAII research projects, appoint
              working groups to conduct workshops for development of science plans for new
              initiatives, and provide the ARCSS Program with an assessment on priorities for
              LAII global change initiatives/projects in the Arctic that are developed
              through the workshops.
