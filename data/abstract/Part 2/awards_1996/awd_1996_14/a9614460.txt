Abstract    :
              9614460  Cline  The major focus of mineral exploration in the United States
              today is centered on the search for Carlin-type gold deposits (CTGD). These are
              large, low-grade, sediment-hosted sytems located in northern Nevada, which are
              noted for the presence of micron-sized "invisible" gold.  In spite of their
              economic importance, the geological processes that caused the formation of
              these deposits remains obscure and geological models continue to be
              descriptive.  The main goal of this proposal is to provide ways to identify the
              geological processes that were essential to the generation of Carlin-type gold
              mineralization.  Specifically, this study will aim to define if fluids involved
              in the transport and precipitation of metals on CTGD's are genetically linked
              to metamorphic or magmatic processes. Furthermore, these results will provide
              new directions for exploration strategies and could produce genetic models that
              can be used later to explore for CTGD in the Great Basin and other parts of the
              world.
