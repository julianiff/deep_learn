Abstract    :
              This travel grant will provide partial support to about 70 U.S. participants
              attending the 1996 International Union for Radio Science (URSI) General
              Assembly in Lille, France from August 28 to September 5, 1996.  The ten U.S.
              URSI commissions select candidates, whose applications are reviewed by the
              travel grant committee of the U.S. National Committee for URSI.  Speakers
              invited by URSI receive primary consideration, but grants are also awarded to
              younger, less established scientists and engineers to increase their knowledge
              of international activities in their fields, and encourage interactions with
              their foreign counterparts.
