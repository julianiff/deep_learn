Abstract    :
              9614869  Harrison   Under normal circumstances, heat  and pressure increase with
              depth in the earth's crust, however a number  of cases of inverted metamorphic
              gradients are well documented in zones of tectonic deformation.  This study
              involves the collection of data that will allow the testing of two competing
              hypotheses of "up-side-down" metamorphic sequences.   One hypothesis holds that
              warmer rocks are thrust over cooler rocks which became heated from above, -
              producing an inverted thermal metamorphic sequence.  The second hypothesis
              proposes that previously metamorphosed rocks, once cooled, are thrust over
              other previously metamorphosed but lower grade rocks. This leads to an up-side
              down gradient in the grade of ancient metamorphic conditions but does not
              reflect an instantaneous up-side-down temperature gradient.  Results will be
              important in understanding the tectonic significance of many examples of
              inverse metamorphism.
