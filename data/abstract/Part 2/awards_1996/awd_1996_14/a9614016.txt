Abstract    :
              9614016  Kaler    Participant support is requested for approximately 10 US
              participants in an international workshop on OSolubilization and Reconstruction
              of Libid Bilayers and Biological MembranesO, to be held June 16-17, 1996 in
              Kfar Blum, Israel.  Topics of the conference are the structural aspects of
              solubilization and reconstitution, the action of sub-solubilizing
              concentrations of micelle forming surfactants on membranes, and aspects of
              membrane phase transitions.  There are applications of these ideas to several
              technologies, including protein purification and material synthesis. 
              Participation by US scientists is essential if the US is to match the pace set
              in the last decade by European, Israeli, and other scientists in many areas of
              complex fluid research.  All attendees will present papers and/or take part in
              panel discussions.  ***
