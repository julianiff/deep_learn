Abstract    :
              9614040  Kleinman  This grant supports theoretical work on a variety of 
              condensed matter systems incorporating both improved  analytical approximations
              as well better computational  techniques.  The physical phenomena under
              investigation  include: response of Mg lattice parameters to pressure,  crack
              propagation as a function of applied strain in Si  using an almost
              first-principle calculation of internal  forces and electronic energy levels in
              a ferro-para-ferro  magnetic sandwich using a highly effective pseudopotential 
              for transition metals developed earlier by the PI.  Finally  there is a project
              to study magnetism in thin films and at a  surface using sophisticated
              electronic structure  calculations.  %%%  The research of this senior PI has
              been  for a long time  geared towards improving both the conceptual and 
              computational foundations of  electronic structure  calculations.  In the
              current grant the program continues  with special emphasis on magnetism and on
              the details of  failure mechanisms in metals.  All of these projects involve 
              state of the art techniques and attempt to remove the  current disagreements
              between theory and experiments. How  does one understand the terminal velocity
              of a crack as it  propagates through a metal?  When is a thin film of a 
              transition metal, which is magnetic in bulk, remains  magnetic when put on top
              of a noble metal as a film?  ***
