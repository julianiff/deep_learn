Abstract    :
              9614773  Wood  This proposal aims to address the lack of data on the behavior of
              Re and Os in hydrothermal solutions with a series of reconnaissance solubility
              experiments to be conducted under a broad range of carefully constrained
              conditions.  The study has the following objectives:  1) determine those
              conditions under which Re and Os are most soluble and place constraints on the
              conditions under which they might be mobile in nature; 2) obtain preliminary
              evidence as to the nature of the predominant dissolved metal species in
              solution (e.g., chloride complex, bisulfide complex, oxyanion); 3) determine
              the feasibility of further experimentation designed to obtain detailed
              stoichiometric and thermodynamic data.  If successful, the results of this
              study could be of immense value in assisting in the interpretation of Re-Os
              systematics in a variety of geological environments.  Furthermore, owing to the
              strong geochemical similarities between rhenium and technicium, knowledge of Re
              solubilities could be relevant to the evaluation of migration of this
              long-lived radionuclide in the near-field environment of deeply buried nuclear
              waste repositories.
