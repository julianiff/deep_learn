Abstract    :
              Today, all areas of technology use signal processing.  The applications range 
              from adaptive coding of speech signals, to analysis of medical images, to echo-
               canceling in cellular telephones.  The successful implementation of signal 
              processing algorithms in both software and hardware is a result of research
              into  various aspects of signal processing, including analysis, modeling,
              synthesis,  algorithm development, tool development, and implementation.  This
              workshop in  intended to bring together a distinguished group of research
              scientists and  educators to explore the expanding role of signal processing
              within applications  that include the telecommunications infrastructure and the
              expanding information  highway.    The workshop will meet for 3 1/2 days to
              assess and document recent advances and  current and future research directions
              in signal processing.  During this time  we expect to prepare recommendations
              for research activities and to initiate a  debate on the future directions of
              the field from among the research community.   Participants will be drawn from
              academia, industry, and companies whose products  include significant signal
              processing components.  The goal of the meeting will  be to develop a vision
              statement for the field and determine areas which have the  potential for high
              payoff in terms of application areas.  The participants will  also discuss ways
              of integrating signal processing research results and  applications into the
              undergraduate engineering curricula - "the integration of  research and
              education."  Another important topic will be the discussion of ways  to promote
              public awareness of the pervasive role of signal processing.
