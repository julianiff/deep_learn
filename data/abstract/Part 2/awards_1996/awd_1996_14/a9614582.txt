Abstract    :
              9614582  Marrett   Fold and thrust belts the result of collisional tectonics,
              are seldom straight.  The salients and recesses observed on several scales in
              orogens may be the result of different mechanisms, however it is commonly
              difficult to determine the three-dimensional kinematic sequences of their
              development.  This project will examine two salients in the Sierra Madre
              Oriental fold-thrust belt where preliminary information hints at significant
              across-strike kinematic variation, and probably two different mechanisms of
              formation.  The salients are unusually well-exposed, and are expected to
              provide adequate controls for rigorous modeling.   Results should help clarify
              the processes that give rise to the three-dimensional complexities curved
              fold-thrust belts.
