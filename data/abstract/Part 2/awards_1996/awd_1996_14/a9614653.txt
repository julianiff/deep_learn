Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS- 9614653     The principal investigators propose to study the
              transport process involved in droplet-based manufacturing of composite
              materials. The configurations to be investigated include a single stream of
              mono-size droplets impinging on a substrate, CO2 laser induced re-melt of the
              substrate at the droplet impact location, and co-deposition of liquid/liquid or
              liquid/solid droplets.  Basic issues to be addressed include droplet impact,
              spreading, solidification sequence, and porosity development. Visualization and
              measurement of relevant parameters will be conducted using a mono-size droplet
              deposition setup.  Numerical models will be developed to simulate the
              deposition process.
