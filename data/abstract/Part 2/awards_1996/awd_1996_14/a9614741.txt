Abstract    :
                A jointly supported NASA,  NSF workshop will examine bipolar processes of
              climate change.  Research results and climate models suggest that climate
              changes observed in Antarctic and Arctic records have occurred similarly in
              both polar regions.  The workshop participants will examine the recent results
              collected seaprately at the two poles and discuss a strategy for modeling
              climate changes that involve bi-polar interactions of the climate.  The
              increased communication between scientists separately studying Antarctic or
              Arctic climates will foster development of better models and enhanced
              collaboration that will lead to improved understanding of global climate
              changes.
