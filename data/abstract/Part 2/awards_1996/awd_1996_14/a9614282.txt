	This project involves a multidisciplinary investigation of
              the deep structure and kinematics of deformation of the Tien Shan, the largest
              and most active intracontinental mountain range in the world.  The objective is
              to understand the dynamic processes responsible for intracontinental mountain
              building, using the Tien Shan as a laboratory to ask:  why and how such
              deformation occurs where it does within continental regions, how such
              deformation evolves with time, what bounds does the deep structure place on
              flow in the mantle, and how do such possible flow and pre-existing geological
              heterogeneity relate to the observed deformation of the upper crust?

	The
              project involves 6 separate disciplines of earth sciences, 8 institutions in
              the USA and involvement of scientists from 6 nations (China, France,
              Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and the USA).
