Abstract    :
              While Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory provides a broad and flexible framework   for
              the formalization of mathematics, recent proof-theoretic research has   shown
              that a good deal of day-to-day mathematical argumentation correlates   more
              closely with much weaker subsystems of second-order arithmetic. In   this
              project Avigad will use model-theoretic techniques to explore the   finitary
              combinatorial consequences of these theories. This includes   finding
              Ramsey-theoretic independences akin to the Paris-Harrington   theorem, and
              developing a combinatorial, model-theoretic approach to   ordinal analysis.   
              The aim of mathematical logic is to create formal models that describe  
              various aspects of mathematical practice, and apply mathematical   techniques
              to the analysis of these models. Since the beginning of   this century, two
              conflicting and antagonistic views of mathematics   have shared an uneasy
              coexistence. From a classical point of view,   mathematics is "about" the
              infinite, yielding powerful and compelling   abstractions. From a constructive
              point of view, mathematics must   always have some concrete, computational
              meaning, from which it   derives its applicability. This project aims to obtain
              a better   understanding of the interplay between these two aspects of  
              mathematical practice, through the formal exploration of infinitary  
              assumptions and their finite, combinatorial consequences.
