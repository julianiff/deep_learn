Abstract    :
              Abstract - Edgar/Trachtenberg - 9614174      This project involves efforts
              directed toward the joint development, implementation, validation and transfer
              of advanced model-based control systems for next generations rapid thermal
              processing (RTP) and plasma etching tools for single wafer processing.  It is a
              joint program between the University of Texas, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD,
              Austin), a manufacturer, and two tool developers and equipment suppliers: 
              Matrix Integrated Systems (Austin, TX)  and AG Associates (San Jose, CA). 
              Microelectronics manufacturing requires advanced systems technology in order to
              achieve satisfactory yields, maximize throughput and reduce costs for 0.25
              micrometer semiconductors.  Improved mathematical models, sensors, and control
              systems can provide the capability to automatically adjust processing
              conditions in response to changes in the process environment and market
              requirements.    To demonstrate the key concepts, the PI's will focus on the
              latest technology using single-wafer reactors.  For various commercial
              equipment systems, in rapid thermal processing, fundamental (theoretical)
              mathematical models will be developed that relate the operating and equipment
              design variables to performance.  These models will be verified using
              production data from commercial equipment located at various industrial sites. 
              Next they will research the application of new sensors and control strategies
              that permit design of advanced model-based controllers for each reactor.  The
              resulting control systems will be tested with real-time computer control of the
              reactors use of in-situ direct and indirect measurements will be investigated
              to improve controller performance.  For plasma etching systems, they will focus
              on the monitoring of end-point signals to determine when the end point is
              reached or if a fault has occurred with the equipment or wafer.
