Abstract    :
              9614664  Yin   Two models for the response of Asia to the collision between
              Indian and Asia are current.  In the extrusion model, convergence is
              accommodated by lateral extrusion of western Tibet moving out of the way to the
              east of the Indian plate, whereas in the crustal thickening model invokes
              north-south shortening and thickening to accommodate convergence.  The active
              Karakorum and Altyn Tagh faults have long been identified as candidates for the
              lateral extrusion model faults.   However, uncertainly about timing and
              magnitude of slip on these faults has precluded quantitative evaluation of the
              relative importance of lateral extrusion vs. crustal thickening tectonics. 
              This project is a mapping, geochronologic and paleomagnetic effort to establish
              slip history for these important faults.  Results are expected to provide a
              quantitative evaluation of the applicability of these models for the Indo-Asian
              collision.
