Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9614038  RASTETTER  MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY    The goal of
              this project is to quantify and to improve understanding of changes in carbon
              storage in terrestrial Arctic ecosystems.  The balance between canopy and soil
              carbon cycling processes, and the interactions between them and soil moisture,
              will help determine whether the Arctic develops as an important sink or source
              for carbon.  This project will focus specifically on modelling canopy carbon
              and water exchange, and synthesize information gathered in experimental
              components of existing programs.  A hierarchy of models will be employed that
              will produce robust regional models of canopy carbon and energy exchange,
              derived from validated process-based models.  The project will integrate
              information collected from Toolik Lake LTER site, make linkages that will
              facilitate the construction of simpler and coarsely-scaled models of canopy
              proecess, and third, create suitably scaled representations of canopy process
              for use by other regional modelling efforts.
