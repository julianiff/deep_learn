Abstract    :
              One of the grand challenges in biophysics is the prediction  of protein folding
              from the amino acid sequence.  The  investigator and coworkers have determined
              an empirical  mathematical function that can recognize the native  conformation
              for many proteins compared to many thousands of  decoy conformation constructed
              from pieces of other protein  crystal structures.  They are now improving this
              function by  testing different functional forms, training against more 
              natives, and challenging it with wider classes of nonnative  folds.  If the
              function can be made smooth enough, it could  quide a search toward the native
              structure as part of a  structure prediction algorithm.    In the current
              excitement over the human genome project, it  is easy to forget that gene
              sequences are like blueprints  for a house, and we are more concerned with the
              house than  the blueprints.  At the moment, we have no idea about the 
              biological and medical role that about a third of the  sequences play once they
              are translated into proteins, the  three-dimensional molecular machines that
              make cells work.  How proteins function depends critically on how these long 
              chains fold up into particular shapes.  This project is  concerned with making
              sense of those thousands of mysterious  sequences by trying to predict their
              three-dimensional  structures.  Workers in this laboratory have developed 
              computer methods to choose the correct structure for a given  sequence out of a
              lineup of many incorrect ones, as in a  huge multiple choice exam.  They are
              now moving toward  answering an essay exam, where the sequence is given, and 
              the structure must not merely be recognized, but  constructed.  Until this can
              be done, much of the value of  the massive sequencing projects cannot be
              realized.
