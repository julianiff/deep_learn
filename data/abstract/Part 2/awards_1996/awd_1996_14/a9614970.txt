Abstract    :
              9614970  Burchfiel         This project involves a four-year multi-disciplinary
              study of  the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau that will integrate space 
              geodetic (GPS) measurements, field geologic and geomorphic studies, 
              topographic and isostatic analyses, and geodynamic modeling.  The  goal is to
              improve understanding of the processes responsible for  the development of the
              Tibetan plateau and, more generally, the  processes responsible for distributed
              continental deformation.  The  study builds on the results of the current
              principal investigator's  work along the eastern margin of the plateau, with a
              new focus on  the morphological development of the plateau.  In broadest terms,
               they seek answers to such fundamental questions as:  What is the  active
              strain (velocity) field within eastern Tibet and its  foreland?  When did it
              develop?  What was the prior distribution of  strain and deformation along the
              eastern plateau?  How and when did  the current morphology of eastern Tibet
              develop?  How does the  distribution of active strain compare to current
              plateau  morphology?  ***
