Abstract    :
                9614463  Chester         This research is for collaborative research between
              Columbia  and Texas A&M Universities on the failure processes in the New 
              Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ) of the Central U.S. through  characterization of
              microearthquake clustering.  Earlier analysis  is to be extended to clustered
              events throughout the NMSZ.  Most  clusters are located near the kink in the
              central segment, or near  the junctions of that segment with other major
              segments.  The  spatial/temporal clusters occur over a range of depths of 4 to
              9  km, display both strike and reverse slip focal mechanisms, and are  located
              both near and away from the segment junctions and the kink.   The goal is to
              provide the best physical model for the clustering  and give additional insight
              into 1) the relation of the static  stress drops of the larger ruptures to
              focal depths, focal  mechanisms, and locations near or away from the junctions,
              2) the  mode of interactions among major fault segments in the NMSZ, such  as
              triggering of ruptures by seismic or aseismic preslip along  intersecting fault
              segments, and 3) the role of fluid involvement  in faulting processes.  This
              research is a component of the  National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
