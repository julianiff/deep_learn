Abstract    :
              9614651  Smalley   This project is designed to compare the rates of deformation
              over geologic time scales of 105-106 years with the rates of deformation over
              human time scales of 10o -101 years.  The area selected for this study is
              western Argentina, where growth structures have been actively evolving for the
              last 5 my.  Deformation is also active and will be monitored by GPS over the
              next 3 years.  These data will also be compared to a decadal record of
              earthquake activity, and aseismic components.  The results will also have
              implications for the episodicity of continental deformation, temporal
              clustering of continental deformation within a volume, and simultaneous
              movements of faults at different sampling intervals.
