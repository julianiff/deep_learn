Abstract    :
              9614149  Leger    The P.I.s propose an experimental study of the dynamics of
              coupled mechanical and chemical processes that occur during the deformation and
              diagenesis of sediments under hydrothermal conditions. During this award
              period, the P. I.'s will begin experimentation on a system more typical of 
              that which occurs in natural sedimentary basins. A sand with the composition of
              a 2-feldspar granite will be deformed under hydrothermal conditions with a pore
              fluid of aqueous brine with a composition typical of that found in sedimentary
              basins.  The hot fluid will be continuously circulated through the sample and
              permeability measured as a function of time in order to study the precipitation
              sealing mechanism discovered in our their work.  Both closed and open fluid
              systems will be studied.  The pore fluids will be sampled periodically to
              monitor its chemical evolution.  The post-experimental material will be studied
              to determine the dissolution and precipitation mechanisms, species and their
              localization.  ***
