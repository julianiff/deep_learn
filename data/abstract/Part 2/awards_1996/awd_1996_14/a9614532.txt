Abstract    :
              9614532  Frey  The long-term goal of this research is to understand the origin
              and evolution of the ~115 Ma record of volcanism related to the Kerguelen
              mantle plume. The Kerguelen plume is particularly important because:1) it is
              long-lived; 2) all aspects of plume-related volcanism are accessible for study;
              3) lavas have a distinctive geochemical signature that may reflect recycling of
              crust into the deep mantle; and d) formation of the large igneous province
              (Kerguelen Plateau) in the newly formed Indian Ocean may have enabled dispersal
              of these plume geochemical characteristics into the Indian Ocean asthenosphere.
               This proposal seeks to extend the current project to include the recent (<40
              Ma) volcanic history of this plume that is recorded in a thick sequence of
              flood basalts which are the major volumetric unit of the Kerguelen archipelago.
               The chemical composition (major and trace element abundances) and isotopic
              (He, Sr, Nd, Pb, and Os) characteristics of these lavas will be determined to
              show how the lava compositions have changed with time (both on a relative and
              absolute basis with control by 40Ar-39Ar dating) and location in the
              archipelago.
