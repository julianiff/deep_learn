Abstract    :
              Romberg  9614031    The Gateways V Conference, titled How Can Curricula Best be
              Disseminated and Implemented, brings together leaders from all the National
              Science Foundation funded elementary, middle, and high school comprehensive
              mathematics curriculum projects in order to share information and experiences,
              and address common questions that have surfaced as materials have been
              developed, tested, and implemented.  This edition of Gateways is hosted by the
              Mathematics in Context materials development project at the University of
              Wisconsin, Madison.  A special feature is a panel discussion on implementation,
              which is an issue of major concern to the materials developers and to NSF.
