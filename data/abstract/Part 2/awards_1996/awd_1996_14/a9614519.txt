Abstract    :
              9614519  Salmon  Planning of the development of technology is critical for
              companies in high-cost, high-technology industries such as integrated circuit
              and electronic system manufacturing.  In response to this need, two
              industry-wide efforts have been initiated; one under the auspices of the
              Semiconductor Industrial Association (SIA) and the other auspices of  National
              Electronics Manufacturing Initiative (NEMI).  The goal of the SIA technology
              roadmapping exercise is to plan research and development tasks required for the
              VLSI wafer fabrication industry.  The goal of the NEMI roadmapping exercise is
              to plan research and development tasks for the electronics industry as a whole.
