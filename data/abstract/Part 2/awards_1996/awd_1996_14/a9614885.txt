Abstract    :
              9614885    The U. S. National Committee for Rock Mechanics (USNC/RM),  which
              represents  the American rock mechanics community in the United States  and 
              internationally, identifies critical issues in rock  mechanics that need to  be
              addressed, and operates under the auspices of the  National Research  Council's
              Board on Earth Sciences and Resources (BESR).  The  expertise,  judgment, and
              strategic perspective of the USNC/RM serves to  define and  help initiate
              sponsored studies and other activities with  respect to major  areas of
              national interest or concern in which rock  mechanics problems  represent
              critical or limiting factors.  The committee  offers a forum for  meetings with
              federal sponsors and other interested  organizations to  exchange ideas and
              information on important topics.  ***
