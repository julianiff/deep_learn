Abstract    :
              9614725  Leeman      This grant provides $48,871 as partial support of the costs
              of  upgrading the X-ray fluorescence spectrometer in the Geology and 
              Geophysics Department at William Marsh Rice University.  Specifically, the
              upgrade would include installation of a PC  control system and associated
              software to replace the DEC PDP-11  system currently installed on their Rigaku
              XRF and two months  salary for their current XRF technician who would train new
              users  of the upgraded XRF.  This upgrade would also include  installation of a
              multi-layered crystal for analysis of light  elements (i.e. B, F).  Upgrade of
              the computer system will ensure  the availability of a critical piece of
              analytical  instrumentation for the analysis of major and trace elements in 
              whole rock samples for studies in igneous and metamorphic  petrology for Rice
              University and a host of other researchers in  the Houston area.  The enhanced
              capabilities to conduct analyses  for light element concentrations (i.e Boron)
              within whole rock  samples will immediately be utilized for research on fluid 
              mobility during metamorphism.  Continued petrologic studies of  magmatic
              processes in a host of environments including volcanic  island arcs, hot spots,
              intracontinental extensional regimes and  metamorphic terranes will also take
              advantage of this upgrade.  ***
