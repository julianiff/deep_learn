Abstract    :
              ***  9614443  Cohen  With the recent dynamic expansion of the National and
              Global  Information Infrastructures, the activities of larger, more  diverse
              communities are becoming integrated. Because of  this, there is great need to
              understand how trust develops  among people acting together in
              computer-mediated ways. This  project will empirically investigate how people
              generate and  maintain trust in task groups working within networked, 
              computer-mediated environments.  It will compare results  from face-to-face
              experimental conditions, with results  obtained from groups working via
              networked computers that  provide "desktop conferencing" video connections, and
               results on groups working via the World Wide Web without  video support. Two
              significant products are expected. First,  the research will provide valuable
              experimental evidence on  whether and how computer mediation affects the
              development  of trust as work groups learn task routines. Second, it will 
              provide extensive development and demonstration of new tools  and methods for
              the conduct of scientific experiments on the  integration and impacts of
              information technology via the  World Wide Web. These include tools and methods
              for  recruitment of subjects, scheduling, instruction,  experimental task
              performance, post-session questioning, and  payment. This promises to help open
              the Web at large as an  active research tool and environment.  ***
