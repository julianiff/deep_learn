Abstract    :
              9614683  Dilles  Copper (Cu) and molybdenum (Mo) ore deposits can be formed as
              products of giant magmatic-hydrothermal systems centered on granitic porphyry
              intrusions.  Hydrothermal wall-rock alteration, vein formation, and ore sulfide
              precipitation form as the result of fracture-focused degassing or granitic
              batholiths to produce aqueous fluids containing dissolved salts, metals,
              sulfur, and acids.  The current models for mineralization of this type need to
              be re-evaluated based on recent research results.  This proposal has as a
              primary goal to improve the understanding of porphyry-type base metal deposits
              by using an integrated geochemical study that focuses on samples derived from
              drill cores that reached deep portions of the giant Butte deposit.  These data
              together with the information that is currently available for higher levels of
              the deposit, should provide an exceptional three-dimensional view of this huge,
              world-class, base metal hydrothermal system.
