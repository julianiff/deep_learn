Abstract    :
              9614366  Jull     The in situ-produced 14C (in situ 14C) research group at the
              University of Arizona, after a number of years developing reliable extraction
              techniques and equipment, is now prepared to bring in situ 14C into the
              mainstream of cosmogenic nuclide surficial process studies, alongside 10Be,
              26Al, 36Cl, 3He, and 21Ne.  New extraction and graphitization lines have been
              constructed in the last two years which, in concert with improved procedures,
              have produced a breakthrough in the isolation of in situ 14C at blank levels of
              approximately 1.1 x 106 atoms.  Using these systems, quartz separates from a
              wave-cut quartzite bench from the well-dated (17.4 + 0.2 cal ky) Bonneville
              shoreline of Pleistocene Lake Bonneville, Utah, and from underlying deeply
              shielded locations were analyzed recently.  Results demonstrate that these new
              systems and procedures can effectively isolate the in situ 14C fraction, with a
              late Quaternary production rate estimate of 20.4 + 1.7 14C atom/gram/year (sea
              level, >60(N)3/4indistinguishable from earlier estimates using older, less
              precise techniques.  The precision on current measurements will allow
              measurement of in situ 14C in quartz after about 500 years of exposure (sea
              level, >60(N).     Research described in this proposal will continue to lay the
              groundwork for using in situ 14C in surficial process studies by (1) further
              testing the accuracy of production rate estimates, (2) assessing the
              variability of 14C thermal release patterns with varying grain size and quartz
              type (i.e., platonic, volcanic, metamorphic), (3) assessing the feasibility of
              whole-rock analyses by comparison to those of quartz separates, (4)
              independently estimating attenuation mean free paths for 14C, and (5)
              empirically testing theoretical models of production rate variation with
              altitude and latitude, to a much greater extent than possible with other
              currently used cosmogenic nuclides, by taking advantage of 14C's rapid (~20 ka)
              attainment of secular equilibrium and insensitivity to  low and moderate (< 1
              cm/ka) erosion rates.  Samples used in this study will come from Tabernacle
              Hill, the Bonneville and Provo Shorelines and other features of the Lake
              Bonneville system, and from altitude and latitude transects in the western
              U.S., Australia, and Antarctica.
