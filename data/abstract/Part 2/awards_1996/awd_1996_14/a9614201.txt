Abstract    :
              9614201  Costa  Sea ice forms an extensive habitat in the Southern Ocean.
              Reports  dating from the earliest explorations of Antarctica have  described
              high concentrations of algae associated with sea-ice,  suggesting that the ice
              must be an important site of production  and biological activity. The magnitude
              and importance of  ice-based production is difficult to estimate largely
              because the  spatial and temporal distributions of ice communities have been 
              examined in only a few regions, and the processes controlling  production and
              community development in ice are still  superficially understood.       This
              study will examine sea ice communities in the Ross Sea  region of Antarctica in
              conjunction with a studies of ice physics  and remote sensing. The specific
              objectives of the study are: 1)  to relate the overall distribution of ice
              communities in the Ross  Sea to specific habitats that are formed as the result
              of ice  formation and growth processes; 2) to study the initial formation  of
              sea ice to document the incorporation and survival of  organisms, in particular
              to examine winter populations within  "snow-ice" layers to determine if there
              is a seed population  established at the time of surface flooding; 3) to sample
              summer  communities to determine the extent that highly productive  "snow-ice"
              and "freeboard" communities develop in the deep water  regions of the Ross Sea;
              4) and to collect basic data on the  biota, activity, and general physical and
              chemical  characteristics of the ice assemblages, so that this study 
              contributes to the general understanding of the ecology of the  ice biota in
              pack ice regions.
