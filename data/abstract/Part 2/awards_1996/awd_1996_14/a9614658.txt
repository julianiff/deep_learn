Abstract    :
              9614658  Braile       This research involves the study of the time-to-failure
              method of  earthquake prediction whereby precursory earthquakes define an 
              accelerated energy release curve associated with a main shock  earthquake. 
              This precursory sequence is modeled and a predicted  magnitude and
              time-of-failure is calculated by solving an equation  containing three unknown
              parameters and a relationship determined  in earlier work on the New Madrid
              Seismic Zone.  The study will  extend the application of this method to
              southern California.  The  primary goal of this research is to improve and
              further evaluate  the method and its uncertainties with the ultimate goal of 
              implementation of practical intermediate-term earthquake  prediction.  This
              research is a component of the National  Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
