Abstract    :
              9614202  Chowdhury    This is a proposal for financially sponsoring electrical 
              engineering students to attend the 1996 IEEE Power Engineering  Society's
              Summer Meeting.  The goal is to give students  opportunities to learn about the
              most recent developments in  power system research, engineering, construction,
              and operation.   Through demonstration of the vitality and vigor of the power 
              industry, students can better evaluate its attractiveness as an  area of study
              and its importance to the future of the United  States and other countries.
