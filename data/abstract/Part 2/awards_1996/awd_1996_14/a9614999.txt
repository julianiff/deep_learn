Abstract    :
              9614999  Coleman  This grant continues the support of the PI's theoretical  work
              on a variety of problems in materials with strongly  correlated electrons.  The
              research program consists of  related topics in heavy fermion materials
              (compounds based  on Cerium and Uranium with anomalously large specific heats) 
              and the wider theme of non-Fermi liquid behavior.  The plan  of research
              includes: Strong coupling study of Hund's  interaction in heavy fermion
              materials, non-linear  susceptibility of a non-Fermi liquid metal, theory of 
              optical Hall conductivity, odd frequency pairing and certain  phenomenological
              formulations of a Kondo insulator.  The  research builds on the PI's
              breakthrough work during the  previous grant on the properties of non-Fermi
              liquid  materials and on unconventional superconductivity.  %%%  Many of the
              Cerium and Uranium based compounds have  extraordinarily large specific heats,
              as if the electrons  were a thousand times heavier.  Ever since the discovery
              of  these materials in mid-eighties, there has been a continuing  interest in
              the properties of these materials.  The PI has  been active in this area, with
              recent contributions to the  possibility of unconventional superconductivity
              and exotic  forms of magnetism.  This grant is to further support the  work of
              this very imaginative and creative scientist.  ***
