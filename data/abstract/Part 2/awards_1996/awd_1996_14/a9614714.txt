Abstract    :
              This dissertation grant proposal is a comparative analysis of the mortuary
              practices of Inuit groups from prehistoric times up to the influence of
              Christianity.  Although Inuit groups are geographically disperse, they share
              many cultural similarities.  However, methods of corpse disposal are varied. 
              The study combines ethnographic and archeological descriptions and data with
              folklore accounts from museums and libraries in the United States, Canada, and
              Denmark in an effort to document the range and nature of the variability.  The
              project will produce a fuller understanding of historic and pre-historic Inuit
              groups and arctic hunter-gatherer mortuary practices.
