Abstract    :
              9614774  Agnew    The PI proposes to do a detailed GPS study along the central
              San Andreas   fault, examining the transition between creeping and locked
              segments of the   fault.  The PI will compliment the geodetic measurements with
              modeling of   the strain field in order to test applicability of elastic
              dislocation   models to the San Andreas region.  ***
