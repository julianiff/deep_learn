Abstract    :
              9614264  Brannon   The proposed work seeks to improve on the isotopic
              methodology for dating ore-stage mineralization in Mississipi Valley-type (MVT)
              Pb-Zn deposits in order to provide necessary constraints for understanding the
              mechanisms of ore formation.  The proposed study will concentrate on: (1) the
              radiometric dating of two North American MVT ore deposits
              (Illinois-Kentucky-Fluorspar and Pine-Point Zn-Pb deposits) for which
              conflicting ages of ore formation exist at the moment; (2) dating of ore-stage
              calcite and sphalerite from mines of the Tri-State (Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma)
              MVT district; and (3) dating two Proterozoic MVT deposits in South Africa,
              thought to be among the oldest deposits of this type currently known.  In
              addition to dating, the Rb-Sr and U-Th-Pb isotopic systematics will be used as
              tracers of the ore-forming fluids.  Information on the source of fluids is
              necessary to assess models of ore genesis in the various localities and to
              construct a better genetic model for MVT's worldwide.
