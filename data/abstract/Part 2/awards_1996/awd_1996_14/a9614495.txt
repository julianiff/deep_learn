Abstract    :
              Michael Fisher is jointly supported by a grant from the Theoretical and  
              Computational Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division and the   Materials
              Theory Program in the Division of Materials Research to   continue his
              theoretical research in statistical mechanics, the study of   ordered states of
              matter, phase transitions between states, and critical   phenomena.   The
              methodologies to be used include thermodynamic and   scaling analyses,
              renormalization group methods, Monte Carlo simulations,   and analytical and
              numerical techniques.  Applications include: 1)   investigations of fluid
              electrolytes that undergo Coulombic as opposed to   solvophobic phase
              separation; 2) investigations of two-dimensional, hard   core ionic fluids
              which provide a basic model for real systems exhibiting   superfluidity and
              superconductivity; 3) the characterization of   thermodynamic behavior near
              critical endpoints, particularly in fluid   mixtures; 4) investigations of wall
              free energies and universal aspects   of critical adsorption.  Theoretical
              models of complex molecular systems are useful for   understanding and
              interpreting experimental observations on these   systems.  They provide
              molecular insights into the complex molecular   interactions that are
              responsible for macroscopic behavior and physical   properties.  Such insights
              are frequently also useful in optimizing the   design of new materials having
              desired properties.
