Abstract    :
              9614704  Appleman    The Cranbrook Institute of Science will develop "Our
              Dynamic  Earth," a 7000 sq. ft. exhibit that will provide visitors with 
              insight and understanding of the interrelationships of plate  tectonics and
              climate to prehistoric life.  This will make up the  earth sciences component
              in their renovated and expanded exhibit  area.  This section will include four
              related areas: 1) Plate  Tectonics, 2) The Earth's Amazing Climate System, 3)
              The Earth  Evolving Biosphere, and 4) An Ecological Whodunit.  Each area will 
              be anchored by an "icon" that will serve as a guiding image for  that exhibit
              and will be supported by a layered interpretation  using objects from the
              collection, workstations with selected  databases, simulated scientific
              investigations, and hot-links to  related Internet Sites.  Numerous
              interactives will highlight the  use of scientific research tools and methods. 
              A broad menu of  complementary educational activities will accompany the
              exhibit  including take-home activities for families; teacher enhancement 
              sessions and materials for students, and experiences for pre-  service
              teachers.  Cranbrook is working with the Detroit Public  Schools in their
              science reform effort supported by an NSF Urban  Systemic Initiative and with
              the Michigan Department of Education  through its NSF Statewide Systemic
              Initiative.  The exhibit  elements will support and reinforce the systemic
              reform efforts and  will be aligned with the science standards.
