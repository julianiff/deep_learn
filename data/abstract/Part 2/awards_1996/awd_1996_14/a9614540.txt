Abstract    :
              9614540  Kezunovic       The Second International Conference on Digital Power
              System  Simulators (ICDS '97) is being organized with an objective of 
              providing a forum for exchange of information among universities,  research
              organizations, manufacturers, consultants and utility  industry regarding
              research, development,implementation and  application in the area of digital
              power system simulators.  The  First Conference (ICDS '95) was the inaugural
              gathering on this  subject and has demonstrated a strong interest in this
              subject  with over 70 papers presented from over 20 countries and close to  150
              participants present.  The exhibit of the state-of-the-art  simulator equipment
              at the First Conference and a similar plan  for the Second Conference provide
              participants with a unique  opportunity to see demonstrations of the existing,
              and new,  designs.       With recent restructuring of the power industry, it
              becomes  important that efficiency and skills of the personnel to be  enhanced.
               Digital simulators provide for an opportunity of  comprehensive study of
              various power system phenomena using their  interfaces that facilitate complex
              evaluations of new power  system designs and related control equipment.  The
              time consuming  and expensive approaches of the past where either field tests
              or  analog simulators are used can be substituted with highly  automated, low
              cost simulators.  The ICDS '97 is a unique forum  for discussion of the most
              recent issues in this area.       The U.S.A. academic institutions have had
              very little access  to advanced analog simulators in the past due to the
              excessive  cost. Today, low cost digital simulators can be developed at the 
              universities using readily available tools.  A need to educate  students in
              this important area is pressing since this can lead  to their interest in
              developing and/or using such equipment in  the future.       This proposal is
              aimed at supporting travel of the  interested students to the conference to
              present and/or to  participate in va rious discussions and presentations.  ***
