Abstract    :
              9614473  Van Schmus   This project to continue work on 1100 to 550 Ma tectonic
              evolution of NE Brazil  and correlative parts of west-central Africa, with
              particular emphasis on developing a comprehensive understanding of a major
              1100-900 Ma orogen recently defined in this region.  The principal methods used
              will be U/Pb, Sm/Nd and Rb/Sr geochronology and isotopic geochemistry in
              conjunction with other studies by Brazilian collaborators.  Results of these
              studies will be useful in efforts to piece together a detailed picture of
              continental breakup and reassembly during the Neoproterozoic for one of the
              largest fold belts formed during the 600 Ma assembly of the West Gondwana.
