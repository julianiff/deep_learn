Abstract    :
               The Joint Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference will   be hosted by
              the Department of Mathematics at the University of   Southwestern Louisiana
              from April 10-12, 1997.  This will be the 31st   annual meeting of the former
              conference and the eighth annual meeting of   the latter conference.  The
              conference will cover topics in general   topology, geometric topology,
              continuum theory, topological algebra, and   dynamical systems.  There will be
              a mix of one-hour and half-hour invited   talks and contributed talks in these
              areas.   This conference has an established history as a large and   successful
              topology conference that covers a wide scope of traditional   areas and has
              expanded to include important areas of application such as   dynamical systems.
               The integration of this area in 1986 was formalized   in 1987 and has remained
              an important emphasis of the conference.
