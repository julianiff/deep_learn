Abstract    :
              9614525  Cormier         This research is to investigate the heterogeneity, 
              anisotropy, and anelasticity of the earth's lowermost mantle and  core by means
              of observed and predicted seismic waveforms  interacting with those structures.
               PKIKP precursors will be  modeled in statistically described structures of the
              lowermost  mantle and compared with observations.  In this comparison, a 
              unified model will be determined, consistent with both PKIKP  precursor data as
              well as with all other broadband waveforms  interacting with the core-mantle
              boundary.  A study will also be  made of the scatter typically found in the
              measurements of the  anelasticity of the inner core.  The results of these
              studies  will be important to geodynamic models of slab cycling, plume 
              formation, and chemical heterogeneity of the earth's deep mantle  and to the
              search for constraints on the high pressure mineral  phase of iron in the
              earth's inner core.  ***
