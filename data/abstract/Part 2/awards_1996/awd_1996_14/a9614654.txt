Abstract    :
              9614654  Isaak and Anderson    The PIs propose to use Resonant Ultrasonic
              Spectroscopy  (RUS) to study the high temperature elasticity of a suite of 
              geophysically important minerals synthesized at high  pressure. The measurments
              will require further development  to adapt the RUS technique for high
              temperature studies on  small samples.  Measurements of single-crysals of
              silicate  perovskite or beta-spinel will be made at room and high  temperature,
              and the high temperature properties of hematite  and magnesiowustite, for which
              larger samples are readily  attained, will also be completed.  The results will
              be used  to constrain the composition of the earth's mantle.  ***
