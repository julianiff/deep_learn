Abstract    :
              Abstract  9614158  Sivjee  This project maintains an infrared spectrophotometer,
              an eight channel photon counting photometer and an infrared Michelson
              interferometer at South Pole, Antarctica to study the dynamics and chemistry of
              the upper atmosphere.  By measuring the variations in the brightness and
              temperature of airglow band emissions it is possible to detect planetary,
              gravity and tidal waves.  The horizontal wave structures are studied by looking
              in several directions while making these measurements at several wavelengths,
              which come from different heights in the atmosphere, provides information on
              the vertical extent of the wave activity.  Additionally, viewing the different
              altitude auroral emissions with the spectrophotometer is providing insight into
              the nature of the sources of the auroal precipitating electrons and how these
              different sources vary as a function of time.  ***
