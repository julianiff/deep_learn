Abstract    :
                This research aims at developing a unified statistical framework for 
              nonlinear signal processing for communications by using a recent extension  of
              maximum likelihood estimation, the maximum partial likelihood (MPL)  estimation
              theory, which allows for dependent and missing observations, and  sequential
              processing of data using only the information that is available  at the time of
              processing.  Previous research has established the  theoretical foundation for
              the statistical analysis of MPL estimation with  a general nonlinear
              probability model and provided a very useful  information theoretic connection.
               The inclusion of the dependent data in  the framework allows addressing of
              problems in coding and modulation in the  presence of sources and channels with
              memory.  This research includes  development of a new class of realtime
              adaptive signal processing  algorithms based on MPL estimation by using
              gradient optimization and  information theoretic alternating projections, and
              the study of their  statistical and dynamic properties and implementations in
              specific  communications applications such as equalization in long distance
              optical  fiber communications and voiced/unvoiced/transition classification in 
              variable rate speech coding.  Another important part of the effort is the 
              investigation of the choices for the conditional probability model within  the
              MPL framework, for which, along with other nonlinear models, such as 
              polynomials, finite normal mixtures, and neural networks, piecewise linear 
              models are used to provide a highly desirable compromise between the 
              approximation ability of nonlinear structures and the efficiency and 
              theoretical accessibility of the linear domain to develop new adaptive 
              algorithms.  The techniques which result from this work are very likely to 
              lead to breakthroughs in realtime signal processing for communications via  new
              algorithms with superior performances and in the general theory of  nonlinear
              techniques in communications via rigorous treatment of t he  underlying
              dependent time series problems.
