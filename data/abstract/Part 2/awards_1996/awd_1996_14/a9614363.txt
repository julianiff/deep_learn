Abstract    :
              9614363  Cohen  This is a renewal proposal to continue theoretical studies of
              iron and iron alloys under conditions of the earth's core.  The PIs plan to
              expand their work into the evaluation of time-dependent properties of the core,
              electromagnetic properties of iron, and the properties of iron alloys.  They
              will also continue to investigate the phase stability of iron, including the
              melting curve which is crucial for constraining the temperature of the core,
              and the sub-solidus phase diagram, necessary to infer the crystalline structure
              of the inner core.
