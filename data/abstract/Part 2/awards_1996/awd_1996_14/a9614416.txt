Abstract    :
                Bass  9614416    The PI proposes a research program to measure acoustic
              velocities  (elastic moduli) of minerals and high-pressure silicates of 
              geophysical interest by Brillouin light scattering experiments.   The main
              thrust of the work will be measurement of velocities and  elastic moduli at
              high pressures in the diamond-anvil cell (DAC),  and at high temperatures. 
              These data are important for placing  constraints upon the mineralogy and
              chemistry of the earth's  interior, and the derivatives of these properties are
              needed in   order to unravel the composition of the Earth's mantle.  Detailed  
              comparisons of results with seismologically determined velocities  for the
              mantle should yield an improved picture of the internal  structure and
              composition of the Earth.  ***
