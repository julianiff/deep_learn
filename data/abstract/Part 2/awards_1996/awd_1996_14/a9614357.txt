Abstract    :
              9614357  Kerr                                  This research involves the
              development of models for  estimating the effects of material variations on the
              mechanics of  earthquake faulting.  The objective is to identify
              characteristics  of surface deformations for distinguishing between homogeneous
              and  nonuniform models in order to understand deformation sources at  depth in
              areas where field observations indicate spatial variations  in material
              properties.  3-D analytical and numerical techniques  will be developed for
              calculating elastic fields in nonuniform  material to investigate how
              subsurface variations in elastic moduli  influence fault mechanics.  Use of
              these models in simulations of  fault behavior will provide more realistic
              calculations of the slip  induced elastic fields, such as the change of the
              stress state that  a slip zone imposes on itself and nearby faults.  This
              research is  a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
