Abstract    :
              9614596  Yelon    This research explores the stability of substitutional- 
              interstitial magnet compounds.  New compounds which are  doubly substituted
              (using an OatlasO to guide the atom  selection) will be prepared and
              characterized.  In addition  the research advances from 2-17 phases to 1-12 and
              6-23  phases.  In prior work neutron diffraction and Mossbauer  techniques were
              used to investigate  a large number of  magnetic alloy systems, and from this
              effort an "atlas" for  the location of substitutional atoms in the R2Fe17
              lattice  was developed.   The details of the changes in Fe-Fe  bounding  were
              followed in this system and in interstitially  modified compounds.  It became
              clear that not all of the  effects on Curie temperature could be attributed to 
              magnetovolume effects, and associated theoretical modeling  contributed to
              better understanding of these compounds.  It  was observed that introducing
              interstitial carbon by  induction or arc-melting during the materials synthesis
               leads to a modification of the substitutional occupancy  patterns, and this
              could result in enhanced stability of  interstitial compounds. This research is
              extended to novel  interstitial compounds in which the interstitial atoms are 
              incorporated from the gas phase (e.g., SiH4, B2H6) or from  the melt in which
              the interstitial atom is tightly bonded to  the substitutional atom (e.g., TiB,
              VC).  The research now  makes use of photoemission measurements of the
              electronic  density of states to compliment the other experiments and  test the
              theoretical calculations being carried out by  collaborators.  %%%  The
              substitutional-interstitial magnetic compounds under  investigation here show
              potential for magnet applications.  The research is building  improved
              understanding for optimum  design of the atomic structural of magnetic
              materials.  ***
