Abstract    :
              9614674  Stock   Baja California has been rifted from mainland Mexico within the
              last 15 Ma, however the amount of displacement, thought to be approximately
              300km, is not well known.  A better measure of displacement is need for several
              purposes including relating slip within the Gulf of California to net motion
              between the Pacific and North American plates and understanding the kinematics
              between Gulf rifting and the San Andreas fault motions.  Because magnetic
              stripes are not developed in the Gulf, the present estimate is based on a
              single tie point across the Gulf, and this project is aimed at re-evaluating
              this critical lithologic correlation and to apply modern methods to establish
              additional ties.  Results are expected to provide a more robust and accurate
              measure of  Baja displacement across the Gulf of California relative to
              mainland Mexico.
