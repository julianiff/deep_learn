Abstract    :
              Abstract  9614912  Wefel  This award provides funds to continue the analysis of
              data acquired from the Japanese American Cosmic-ray Emulsion-chamber Experiment
              (JACEE) experiment over the past several years.  JACEE has flown balloon borne
              payloads for long periods, up to 2 weeks, from McMurdo on paths which
              circumnavigate the pole.  The experiments consist of stacks of photgraphic
              style emulsions which record the paths and interactions of energetic cosmic
              rays.  The emulsions are developed once they are recovered from the ground, and
              by measuring the tracks, the isotopic mass of the elements which made them are
              determined.  JACEE is one of the few experiments which is providing data on the
              elemental constituents of cosmic rays with energies near 10^15 eV, which will
              provide important information on the origin of cosmic rays.  JACEE is a
              collaboration of NASA/MSFC, the Universities of Washington and Alabama,
              Louisiana State University and several institutions in Japan and Poland.  The
              balloons, launch services and tracking were provided by NASA while the
              logistics, housing and payload recovery were provided by NSF's Office of Polar
              Programs.  ***
