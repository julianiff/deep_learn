Abstract    :
              9614512  Steiner     Environmental extrema at the end of the Paleozoic are
              manifest in evidence for profound marine regression, severe faunal and floral
              extinctions, and geochemical and isotopic anomalies (e.g. Holser and Magaritz,
              1987; Erwin, 1993; Veevers et al., 1994).  The search for a cause or causes, as
              well as establishing genetic links between the observed phenomena, is hindered
              by a paucity of reliable geochronologic data.  Though the Permian-Triassic
              (P-T) boundary is now reasonably well dated, much work remains to test whether
              the boundary events were globally isochronous and to establish the time scale
              of events before and after the boundary.  Whether the extinctions were
              protracted or rapid, or occurred in pulses, relies on better calibration of the
              time scale.  The research proposed herein would provide high-precision Ar/Ar
              and U/Pb dates for tephras combined with magnetostratigraphic data, which would
              vastly improve the resolution of the time scale.  Establishing a
              well-calibrated magnetic polarity time scale will facilitate global
              correlations and help obviate problems arising from faunal provincialism and
              possible diachronism of biostratigraphic boundaries.   The proposed research
              would concentrate on sections in the western interior U.S. for which many data
              and samples already been obtained.  The project will also include
              geochronologic work and paleomagnetic feasibility studies are proposed which
              would help determine whether sections in Argentina, Australia, China,
              Greenland, New Zealand, and South Africa merit future research towards the
              goals of this project.
