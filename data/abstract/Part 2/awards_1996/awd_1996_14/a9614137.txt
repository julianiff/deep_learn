Abstract    :
              9614137  Cole    This project will analyze oxygen and carbon stable isotopes and
               trace elements (U, Ba) in corals from the Kenyan coast over the  last few
              centuries.  The data will provide a long-term continuous  record of decade- to
              century-scale variability in SST and river  runoff (=rainfall) for a
              poorly-known tropical region, and will  contribute to understanding linkages
              between regional monsoon  variations and larger-scale features such as ENSO.
