Abstract    :
              9614879  Tauxe    This grant provides $118,555 as partial support of the costs
              of  acquiring equipment for the Paleomagnetic Laboratory at the  Scripps
              Institution of Oceanography (SIO).  Specifically, the  equipment to be
              purchased will include a system upgrade for their  2-G enterprises Model 760
              superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM)  with DC SQUIDS and a rebuilt
              cryocooler and new compressor,  degaussing system electronics and coils and an
              ARM magnetizer for  alternating field experiments, and an automatic sample
              handler.  Additional equipment to be purchased and/or fabricated "in-house" 
              includes a low temperature cryostat for their Micromag  alternating field
              gradient magnetometer (AFGM), a furnace for  thermal demagnetization studies, a
              Kappabridge and other  ancillary laboratory equipment.  This equipment will
              allow  paleomagnetists at SIO to conduct further research on the  relative
              paleointensity recorded in very weakly magnetized marine  sediments from the
              Ontong-Java Plateau and from sections of the  Cretaceous Normal Superchron,
              Umbria Italy.  Additional studies  that will be enhanced by the capabilities of
              the new equipment  will include but are not limited to, records of the global 
              paleointensity of the Earth's magnetic field from submarine  basaltic glass
              collected from DSDP/ODP drill sites into basement,  analyses of the physical
              properties of geologic materials from  examination of hysteresis loop behavior
              over a wide range of  temperatures, thermal demagnetization studies of lava
              flows from  the Azores and the Canary Islands to determine paleosecular 
              variation of the geomagnetic field since the early Pliocene and  rock magnetic
              characterization of mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB)  from the southern East
              Pacific Mid-Ocean Ridge (EPR) to aid in  explanation of a widespread occurrence
              of a short-wavelength high  in sea-surface magnetic anomalies over ridge axes,
              termed the  Central Anomaly Magnetic High (CAMH).  ***
