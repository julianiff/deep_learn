Abstract    :
              9614858  Friedman    The New York Hall of Science, in collaboration with the
              Lawrence Hall of Science, is producing and evaluating an application of
              recently available technology, the random-access audio player, which offers the
              promise of improving the effectiveness of learning at science-technology center
              interactive exhibits.  The audio "tours" that are being produced and tested
              will have varying degrees of branching and layering appropriate to the nature
              of each exhibit unit design.  A "highlights" audio tour will be created for the
              Lawrence Hall of Science and an audio tour focusing on a single group of light,
              color, and vision exhibits will be created for the New York Hall of Science. 
              The audio tours will be tested with two different categories of audience at
              each site:  the general public on weekends and schools groups on weekdays.     
              Alan Friedman, Director of the New York Hall of Science, will be the Principal
              Investigator.  The Lawrence Hall of Science will be represented by Brooke
              Smith. The audio tours will be written and produced by Steve Tokar, the
              producer of Science Today a daily radio science program on the CBS radio
              network.  Beverly Serrell, Director of Serrell & Associates, will conduct the
              evaluation of the audio tours at each site.
