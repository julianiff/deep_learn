Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) is supported in  the Analytical
              and Surface Chemistry Program.  During the tenure of  this twelve-month
              standard grant, Professor Winograd and his  research group at the Pennsylvania
              State University will explore  the feasibility of using time-of-flight
              secondary ion mass  spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) methods for the chemical analysis
              of  combinatorial libraries.  The molecular specificity of TOF-SIMS  methods,
              coupled with the two-dimensional spatial resolution of a  rastered ion beam,
              will be used to analyze combinatorial libraries  formed on Merrifield bead
              substrates.  Success in this endeavor  will enhance the speed with which such
              libraries can be analyzed  and accelerate progress in the area of combinatorial
              methods of  synthesis.  Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry is an
              extremely  powerful technique for molecular identification and quantification. 
               The inclusion of rastered ion beam technology adds two-dimensional  spatial
              resolution to this analytical capability and suggests a  method for the rapid
              analysis of `libraries` of chemical compounds  produced by combinatorial
              synthetic methods.  Professor Nicholas  Winograd and his students at Penn State
              University will determine  the feasibility of this analytical approach with
              support from this  Small Grant for Exploratory Research.  The development of 
              successful strategies for combinatorial library analysis will  assist markedly
              in the advancement of this area of synthetic  chemistry.
