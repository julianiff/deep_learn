Abstract    :
              This study proposes to elucidate the role of high latitude ecosystems in the
              global carbon cycle and to assess the sensitivity and uncertainty of
              terrestrial carbon storage responses to transient changes in climate.  The
              study will synthesize and integrate data from investigations of carbon cycling
              at local, regional, and global scales with the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model
              (TEM).  Once the TEM is tested, the model will be run for the historical
              transient climate to compare estimated temporal and spatial variations in
              terrestrial carbon storage with those estimated by analysis of the historical
              record of atmospheric carbon dioxide.  The results will be useful for
              identifying the uncertainty in carbon storage responses of high latitude
              ecosystems and for assessing the effects of climate change in terrestrial
              systems.
