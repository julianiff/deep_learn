Abstract    :
              Abstract/Avery-(ATM-9614613)         The objectives of this research are: (1) to
              continue our  observations of the atmospheric processes that operate throughout
               the tropical Pacific using the Tropical Pacific Profiler Network  (TPPN), (2)
              to extend our existing multi-year observations into  projected periods of
              strong climate variability, (3) to extract  from these observations accurate
              values of the three-dimensional  wind fields, including mean values as well as
              seasonal and shorter-  term variability (e.g., tidal and gravity wave
              intesities, (4)  using TPPN results in conjunction with other data bases, to
              study  the relationship between these quantities and global circulation,  El
              Nino, tropical convection, tropical rainfall estimation and  diabatic heating,
              and orographyically-generated waves, and (5) to  provide data from the profiler
              network to the rest of   the scientific community by means of an Internet Web
              Site as well  as by digital computer disks.
