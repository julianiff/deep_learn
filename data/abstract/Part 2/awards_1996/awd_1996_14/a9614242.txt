Abstract    :
              AST-9614242  Donald N. B. Hall  Robert D. Joseph    This award supports a
              portion of the cost incurred by visiting  astronomers conducting observations
              at the NASA 3-meter Infrared  Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. 
              The IRTF is  operated as a national facility by the University of Hawaii's 
              Institute for Astronomy under a contract with NASA.  By agreement  between NASA
              and NSF, visitor support costs are shared between  the two agencies.  The NSF
              portion is primarily for support of  visitors doing non-solar system research. 
              Visitor support covers  accommodation and food service at the mid-level
              facility,  cryogens, local transportation, and partial publication costs.
