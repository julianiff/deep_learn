Abstract    :
              9614620  Samson   A major problem in plate tectonics is defining the positions
              of continental blocks in the past, but these plate reconstructions become
              increasingly different with increase in age, until the Precambrian, where the
              large uncertainties lead to major controversies.   Part of the problem stems
              from the lack of knowledge of the even identity of individual crustal blocks. 
              The project involved the systematic geochemical analysis of Precambrian rocks
              in northern France to determine their relationship to other crustal blocks in
              the circum Atlantic region.  The chemical compositional, isotopic, and age
              information to be collected will be used to test several possible correlations
              of the rocks which will in turn lead to a better understand of Precambrian
              tectonics.
