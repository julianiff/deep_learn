Abstract    :
                    Abstract    OPP-9614368  Kane, Douglas  University of Alaska    The
              project is to provide partial support for the Eleventh International Symposium
              and Workshop of the Northern Research Basins.  Hydrologic researchers from the
              US, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden.  The
              workshop will be held in Prudhoe Bay and Fairbanks, Alaska in August 1997.  The
              participants will examine the global scale climate dynamics responsible for the
              regional interactions and variability of Arctic hydrologic systems.  Spatial
              patterns throughout the Arctic will be used to provide a comprehensive picture
              of the water and energy budgets that are driven by global change factors.
