Abstract    :
              Based on the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Rankine-Hugoniot relations, plasmas can
              have six types of shocks:  fast, slow, and four types of intermediate.  Given
              the significant role slow shocks play in the large scale structure of the
              magnetotail, the investigators will examine their kinetic properties using a
              combination of two-dimensional hybrid and two-dimensional full particle
              simulations.  Hybrid simulations will be used to address the structure of the
              newly discovered anomalous slow shocks, and examine the type of slow shocks
              possible in the fast Petscheck reconnection configuration.  The full particle
              simulations will explain some puzzling aspects of electron distributions
              observed in the magnetotail.  Next, the PI will examine the dynamic formation
              of multiple boundaries and their interactions, similar to reconnection events
              at both the Earth's magnetotail and magnetopause.  By integrating these
              approaches and using observations as a guide, the PI will enhance general
              understanding of discontinuities in general, and their role in the
              magnetopause/magnetotail.
