Abstract    :
              9614502  Wiens                                 This research involves the
              application of advanced analysis  methods to data from recent, highly
              successful PASSCAL experiments  in the Tonga-Fiji region to better resolve the
              seismological  structure of the Tonga Slab and Lau back arc basin and address 
              questions concerning the seismic velocity anomalies and  mineralogical
              composition of subducting slabs, the occurrence and  behavior of phase
              transitions in and near subducting slabs, and the  depth extent of seismic
              anomalies associated with back-arc  spreading centers.  Processes associated
              with the formation of new  lithosphere at spreading centers and its return into
              the mantle at  subduction zones are of primary importance in understanding the 
              dynamics of the earth.  This subduction zone with associated  backarc spreading
              center offers the ideal opportunity to image both  processes and provide
              insight into the cause of deep earthquakes.   This research is a component of
              the National Earthquake Hazard  Reduction Program.  ***
