Abstract    :
              9614705  Fischer         This research involves a study of the direction of
              mantle flow  around deep continental roots in the northeastern U.S. by means of
               the mapping of the direction of anisotropy, and a study of the  vertical
              distribution of that anisotropy.  Anisotropy measurements  will be done through
              shear-wave splitting from existing SKS and Ps  phases converted from upper
              mantle discontinuities and from a  deployment of PASSCAL seismic stations to
              fill in gaps in coverage.   The vertical distribution of anisotropy will be
              determined from the  comparison of splitting of Ps from discontinuities at
              different  depths.  A series of 2- and 3-D numerical calculations will model 
              the strain fields and anisotropy produced by strong continents  translating
              through weaker surrounding mantle.  The study should  allow the assessment of
              flow patterns around continental roots, the  degree of strain produced in
              continents by present-day plate motion  versus fossil deformation, and the
              degree of coupling between  continental roots and the deeper mantle.  The flow
              and coupling are  important for the determination of crustal forces that are 
              responsible for earthquakes in the eastern U.S.  This research is  a component
              of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
