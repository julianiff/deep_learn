Abstract    :
              9614753  Cashman  It is proposed to quantify the effect of magma ascent rate on
              both volatile loss and crystallization through a detailed study of the products
              of several eruptions representing a range of eruptive styles, magnitudes, and
              magma composition. The central focus will be to re-examine the 1980-1986
              explosive and effusive products of Mount St. Helens, with the specific goals of
              determining quantitative relations between eruption rate and pyroclast
              textures, and examining the conditions that led to the 1980 transition from
              pulsatory explosions to purely effusive eruptions.  Additional studies of
              deposits from other well characterized volcanic eruptions (i.e. Taupo in New
              Zealand, and Vesuvius in Italy) will permit generalizations of this work to
              different magma compositions and eruptive conditions.  With the results of
              these studies, it will be possible to evaluate the importance, respectively, of
              factors such as interaction with external water and compositional dependence of
              crystallization in the generation of variably vesicular and micro-crystalline
              pyroclasts.  The larger goal of this investigation will be to determine the
              physical processes that control eruptive styles in intermediate-to-highly
              siliceous magmatic systems.
