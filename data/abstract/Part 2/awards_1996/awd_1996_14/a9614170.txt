Abstract    :
              9614170  Wu  This project is concerned with theoretical studies of  lattice
              models in statistical physics with emphasis on exact  results and applications.
               While most exact results are  limited to 2-dimensions, this project proposes
              to study the  3-dimensional systems by building around the 2-d solution. 
              Specific plans include: analysis of the relationship between  a quantum spin
              system in 2-dimension and a classical one in  3-d,  further work on certain
              conjectures on the  distribution of zeroes of the Potts model partition
              function  and directed percolation problem in 3-d.  Additional  projects
              involve: investigation of roughening of crystal  surfaces, gel-sol transition
              in a ternary polymer solution,  the mathematical problem of restricted
              partitions of an  integer and derivation of a new link invariant  in the 
              theory of knots and kinks.  %%%  This PI is widely known for his contributions
              to more  mathematical aspects of the materials related problems.  In  research
              on the fundamental properties of materials and  phase transitions, this PI has
              made contributions where the  problem has been simplified to the extent that a 
              mathematically exact and rigorous solution is possible.  The  more realistic
              problems then can be understood by building  up on the exact results.  Much of
              the present grant supports  search for exact solutions in bulk (3-dimensional)
              on  certain simplified models where the solution is known for a  thin film (in
              2-d).  ***
