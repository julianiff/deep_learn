Abstract    :
              9614060  Mead  Reliability assessment of semiconductor diode laser devices will
              be important for qualification of device performance over extended periods and
              in challenging environmental settings.  Contemporary methods of estimating
              device reliability are typically limited to empirical formulas such as the
              Arrhenius expression.  These methods are often vendor specific and do not
              provide significant insight into environmental factors that most  affect
              longevity and reliable operation of over long periods.    This research will
              investigate a method for non-destructively assessing degradation of diode laser
              facets using the optical spectra of the device and phonon spectra in the region
              of interest.  ***
