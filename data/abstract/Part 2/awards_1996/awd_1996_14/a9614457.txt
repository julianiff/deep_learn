Abstract    :
              9614457  Halliday  This proposal will focus on placing constrains on the early
              evolution of the Earth-Moon system by studying chalcophile and siderophile
              element abundances and isotopic compositions.  The concentrations of Zn, Ga,
              Ge, Mo, Ru, Pd, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Te, W, Ir, Pt and Tl will be determined by
              isotope dilution, primarily using the new technique of  MC-ICPMS.  Isotopic
              compositions and concentration data will then be used to test models of
              accretion and core formation.  The history of core formation and accretion in
              the inner solar system will be constrained using high precision W isotopic
              compositions of chondritic meteorites, early lunar rocks and achondrites.  In
              addition, Pb-Tl geochronology will be developed in order to explore the timing
              of the dominant depletion of volatile elements on the Moon and other inner
              solar system objects, and possibly to allow measurement of precise ages for
              differentiated meteorites.
