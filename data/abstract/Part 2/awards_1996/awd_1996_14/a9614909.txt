Abstract    :
                This Minority Research Planning Grant initiates research leading to a novel 
              approach in ATM network bandwidth allocation and call admission.  The key 
              contribution of the proposed work is the use of indices of dispersion (in 
              addition to traditional parameters) and low-pass filtering to characterize  ATM
              network traffic.  The resource allocation schemes will be implemented  on
              existing ATM testbeds.
