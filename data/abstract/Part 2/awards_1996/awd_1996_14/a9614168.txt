Abstract    :
              9614168  Beroza         This research is to develop new techniques for imaging
              and  understanding fault rupture by means of a dynamic approach to the 
              finite-fault inverse problem.  The finite-fault inverse problem  is inherently
              under-determined and hence non-unique.  Smoothing  constraints, often
              arbitrary, are usually applied to stabilize  the solution.  Dynamic rupture
              modeling puts the stabilization  parameters on a physical basis.  The research
              will focus on 1)  solving the finite-fault inverse problem of dynamic
              parameters  and 2) developing a method to properly account for data, model, 
              and modeling uncertainty in waveform inversion.  This research is  a component
              of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
