Abstract    :
              9614001  Kear    This grant supports a conference on nanostructured materials 
              with emphasis on key issues associated with the science and  technology of
              these materials.  Sessions examine the  commercialization of nanostructured
              materials for both near  and long term applications.  Topical areas of interest
              to  the meeting include synthesis and processing of  nanostructured materials,
              including the issues of high  reactivity, contamination and improved
              consolidation;  characterization of properties of nanostructured materials; 
              microstructural characterization and related property  correlations;
              thermodynamics and first-principle  calculations, including growth kinetics and
              atomistic  models; near term and long term applications of  nanostructured
              materials, including the issues of scale-up  production, near-net shape
              forming, processing optimization,  and cost-benefit analyses. The grant
              supports student  researchers to attend the meeting and present papers and 
              posters.  %%%  The conference explores new developments in the field of 
              nanocrystalline materials.  Unique properties have been  demonstrated in a
              broad range of these materials.  The  properties derive from their fine
              structural features, such  as a grain size or layer thickness, that is on a
              scale on  the order of 1 to 100 nanometers.  ***
