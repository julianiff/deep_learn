Abstract    :
              9614747  Sahagian  Computed X-ray Tomography (CXT) has recently emerged as a
              particularly useful technique for non-destructive 3-dimensional analysis. We
              propose to develop CXT methods to determine vesicular properties of volcanic
              rocks, for future application to various geologic problems.  A number
              geological  factors control the final geometry and structure of observed
              vesicles in volcanic rocks. We will study the rocks to ultimately gain insights
              into volcanic processes and conditions. These include paleoelevation and
              paleoatmospheric pressure, vesiculation dynamics, magma and lava flow dynamics
              and eruption styles. In addition, the processes which control bubble growth can
              be better understood if the volumes, shapes, and other 3-dimensional
              characteristics of bubbles can be quantified. There are various methods for
              determining 3D characterizations of vesicularity. We propose to quantify 2D
              stereological methods so that their applicability to common non-spherical
              vesicle shapes can be delineated. The main tasks in the work plan will be to:
              Identify and reanalyze bubble size distribution data (from existing plastic
              casts); Conduct stereological analysis and CXT on the samples; Develop and
              apply software for CXT analysis and visualization; Compare CXT results with
              stereological results on the identified suite of samples. The results of the
              proposed project should provide useful tools applicable to a variety of
              scientific problems facing the petrologic research community.
