Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, extends  Professor Grassian's earlier research work on surface
              photochemistry into the field of oxide  surfaces.  During the tenure of this
              three-year continuing grant, thermal and photo-driven  chemistry on oxide
              surfaces will be examined using techniques ranging from infrared and  optical
              spectroscopy on high surface area powders to electron spectroscopic studies of
              single  crystal samples.  The interaction of nitrous oxide with zirconia
              surfaces forms one focus of  the project.  The interaction of small molecules
              of atmospheric importance with model  mineral aerosol surfaces will also be
              explored.  Results of these basic studies will be of  interest in developing an
              understanding of catalytic and environmental processes occurring on  oxide
              surfaces.  Light-driven surface reactions are of interest in a variety of
              technical applications.  For  example, the reaction of nitrous oxide on
              zirconia surfaces may be of importance in the  environmentally benign synthesis
              of synthetic fiber precursors.  The basic research supported  in this project
              addresses the detailed mechanisms of surface photochemical reactions such as 
              this one.  In addition, small molecule reactions on model mineral aerosol
              surfaces will be  examined, with possible application in our developing
              understanding of tropospheric  mechanisms of air pollution generation.
