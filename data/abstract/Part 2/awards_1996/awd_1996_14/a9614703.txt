Abstract    :
              9614703  Williams  This is a proposal to develop further a new instrument
              (GASPEC) as a true remote sensor capable of measuring quantitatively CO2
              emissions from volcanoes. The prototype instrument was developed in the past 4
              years and has as a final goal to test eruption forecasting models and produce a
              monitoring tool for active volcanoes.  The first step for this project will be
              to use a coal-fired power plant in N. Arizona as an acessible natural
              laboratory.  In this step, it is proposed to work on deconvoluting the complex
              raw numbers obtained by the GASPEC into signals caused by CO2, H2O vapor,
              clouds, ash, temperature changes, etc. which represent the reality of the
              atmosphere near volcanoes.  The second step will be to take the instrument to
              Etna, as this is a very well-known active volcano, thought to be the major
              source of volcanic CO2 in the world.  During this stage of the project, the
              focus will be on long-term observation and comparison of the changes in CO2/SO2
              as obtained by GASPEC and other remote and direct sensors that are currently
              available.  The planned research will allow a more friendly use of the
              instrument and should be capable of deconvoluting the complexity of infrared in
              the lower atmosphere, which may make the GASPEC a standard monitoring tool in
              volcanoes.
