Abstract    :
              9614749  Burbank         This award provides support for a workshop in Nepal. 
              The  workshop will bring together American and Nepalese scientists  involved in
              a project to study the interactions and feedbacks  between geomorphic,
              climatic, and tectonic processes in the  Nepalese Himalaya.  The purpose of the
              workshop is to discuss the  logistics of the research project, to preview the
              available data  already collected by governmental agencies in Nepal, to set up 
              formal collaborations between the two groups, to partition  responsibilities
              for certain data-collection tasks, to walk through  the study area, to identify
              tributary catchments for detailed  studies in the future, and to collect
              samples which can be used to  test the utility of various approaches to the
              quantification of  erosion, deformation, and climate.  ***
