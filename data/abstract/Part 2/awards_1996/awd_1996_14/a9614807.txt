Abstract    :
              9614807  Zhang       The award supports the National Conference on Rapid
              Prototyping to be held at the University of  Maryland, College Park, Maryland,
              October 1-2, 1996.  The objectives of the conference are:  (1) to bring  
              together of scientists, engineers, developers, and users from academia,
              industry, government, and trade associations to discuss key issues in rapid
              prototyping engineering research; and (2) to encourage students to   exchange
              research experiences in the rapid prototyping education.   The organizers plan
              to invite ten  research leaders in the rapid prototyping field to discuss
              fundamental research issues. Invited companies will be demonstrating their
              recent developments with exhibits.   The organizers also plans to invite ten
              graduate students from different universities to exchange their research
              experiences in this field.   The participating students will be nationally
              selected.  In addition, four high schools in the State of Maryland will be
              invited   to participate in the hands-on workshop and exhibits to learn about 
              rapid prototyping technologies at the conference.  A conference proceeding will
              be assembled by the awardee.        The principal investigator and his
              colleagues have organized similar conferences in the past. The University of
              Maryland has made strong commitment to support the activities.  In addition,
              the Student Chapter of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME) at the
              University of Maryland is co-organizing the conference..
