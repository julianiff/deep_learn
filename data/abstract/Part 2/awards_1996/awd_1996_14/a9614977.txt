Abstract    :
              9614977   Williams    The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics will
              organize a national symposium on the role and nature of algebra in the K-14
              curriculum.  The symposium will bring together 250 representatives from all
              segments of the mathematics community to consider issues surrounding the
              content and teaching of school algebra.  Goals of the symposium are:  to
              promote an informed dialogue on issues concerning the K-14 algebra curriculum; 
              to provide examples of students' algebraic thinking,  synthesize research, and
              examine impact the reality of algebra in the school curriculum;  to provide a
              forum for elementary, middle, high school and post-secondary curriculum
              projects to share their interpretations of algebra;  and to prepare
              participants to replicate similar symposia on a smaller scale in their local
              regions.  The Algebra Symposium is funded by NSF at $77,965 with cost-sharing
              of at least $20,000.
