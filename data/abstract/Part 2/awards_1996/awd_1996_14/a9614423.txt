Abstract    :
              9614423  Mysen   The principal objective of the proposed research is to
              investigate in-situ at high temperature and pressure (crustal and upper mantle
              conditions) the chemical structure of hydrous silicate melts and associated
              hydrothermal fluids as a function of temperature, composition, and pressure. 
              This pilot project will focus on a systematic study of water-saturated
              potassium silicate melts and coexisting aqueous fluids. The project will
              involve complementary studies including  (1) in-situ Raman spectroscopic
              measurements of both the melt and aqueous phase, and (2) phase equilibrium
              experiments and necessary analytical examination to determine the exact
              compositions of the two phases.   Spectroscopic studies will be performed using
              externally- heated diamond-anvil cells which are capable of being used to
              temperatures of 1000oC and pressures in excess of 2.5 Gpa.
