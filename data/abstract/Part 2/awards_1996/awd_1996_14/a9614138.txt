Abstract    :
              96-14138  Merrill    The PI proposes a theoretical study to determine the 
              structures and energy minimum states for pseudo single domain  (PSD) grains, in
              which stable magnetization in rocks  typically resides.  Preliminary analyses
              show that there are  local energy minimum states even for the small grains 
              exhibiting magnetic vortex structures, and that for a limited  range of sizes
              and  shapes, the global energy minimum state is that in which the 
              magnetization is along the shortest dimension of the grain.  This feature is
              contrary to what is expected and described  widely in the community, and it has
              important ramifications  for inclination anomalies, anisotropy, and for the
              origins of  remanent magnetizations.  ***
