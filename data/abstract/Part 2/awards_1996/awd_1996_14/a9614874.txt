Abstract    :
              9614874  Revenaugh    This research involves the mapping of crustal scatterers
              by means  of the application of Kirchhoff migration inversion techniques to 
              local earthquake data.  Current research has successfully  emonstrated the
              effectiveness of the methodology using three  different scattering modes.  1) P
              scattered into Rg due to  topography and scattered Rg due to shear-wave
              heterogeneity; 2) P  to P scattering due to a subducting slab; and 3) P to S
              scattering  due to fault zone heterogeneity, presumably temporal in nature 
              related to the timing of earthquake occurrence.  This work will  involve
              modification of the migration technique to better model  high-frequency wave
              propagation, include azimuthally varying  scattering intensity and site
              responses and use the latest  tomographic models in the travel time
              calculations.  Data from  seismic arrays in California, Hawaii, and western
              Washington will  be used.  The results are related to  earthquake hazard
              mapping,  volcanic hazard mapping and crustal and upper mantle structure.  This
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard  Reduction Program.
