Abstract    :
              9614499  Barth   The plate configurations during Precambrian time are difficult
              to reconstruct, but are of considerable interest, both from a global
              perspective (style of tectonics including assembly of supercontinents) and more
              local (influence of  precambrian geometry on younger events).  This project
              will examine early proterozoic gneisses in southern California that contain
              evidence of a deformation event, possibly associated with an arc and a western
              Archean (?) craton.  The study will support mapping and structural analysis of
              this hypothesized arc accretion event in the western mojave province, supported
              by U-Pb geochronology to constrain the timing of orogeny.   Insights into the
              origin of the Mojave province from this study will provide important
              constraints on geochemical models for Precambrian growth of the North American
              craton, subsequent deformation and plate tectonic models for accretion of the
              Late Proterozoic supercontinent.
