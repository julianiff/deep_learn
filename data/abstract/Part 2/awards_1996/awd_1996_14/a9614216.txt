Abstract    :
              9614216  WITMAN  This project is supported as a high risk, rapid response
              project  to investigate the causes and consequences of a regional, massive 
              recruitment of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, to the rocky  shores off New
              England.  This vast and unusual recruitment  occured in the period around
              August -September 1995 from Maine to  Massachusetts.  This project will look at
              the fate of this  population increase and its influences on the subtidal 
              communities of plants and animals in the New England region.  The  spatial
              extent of the event, the changes in local cover over time  and pilot
              experiments on its impact will be pursued.    ***
