Abstract    :
              9614649  Baumgartner  The aim of this research is to study the effect of
              spatially heterogeneous and temporally evolving permeability through field and
              geochemical studies in the Ubehebe Peak contact aureole and to develop a finite
              element code capable of modeling the basic physical, thermodynamic and
              transport processes occurring in a typical upper crustal contact aureole. This
              includes mass and heat transport, reactive tracer transport, metamorphic
              reactions, reaction enhancement of permeability, and collapse of permeability.
              The objectives of the proposal are to: (a) complete a geostatistically based
              data set of stable isotope compositions of carbonates and silicates in the
              aureole; (b) establish a geostatistically valid major and trace element data
              base; (c) expand the capabilities of the finite element code to model
              infiltration driven mixed volatile reactions, porosity and permeability changes
              due to reaction progress of such reactions; (d) to include in the code simple
              rheological models to simulate pore collapse due to plastic, brittle, or
              elastic failure of a rock undergoing reactions. The evolution of porosity, and
              hence permeability, in such models can be predicted using the fully coupled
              transport code together with phenomenological equations linking permeability
              and porosity, reaction progress and porosity, as well as elastic and plastic
              pore collapse.
