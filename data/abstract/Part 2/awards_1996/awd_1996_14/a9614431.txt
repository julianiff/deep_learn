Abstract    :
              9614431  Rice    This research involves a continuation of the study of
              seismicity in  coupled subduction segments and their surroundings (overriding 
              plate, sea floor and subducting slab) to understand the strength  and
              heterogeneity of coupling along the thrust interface.  Specific  areas of
              investigation are 1) investigation of the relations  between heterogeneous
              seismic coupling along the main thrust zone  and seismicity in the sea floor
              and upper plate areas; 2)  explanation of seismicity in the descending slab at
              intermediate  depths and its relation to coupling; 3) correlation of seismicity
               with changes in a Coulomb measure of stress change (shear minus  friction
              coefficient times normal stress change) in a subduction  zone and its vicinity;
              and  4) investigation of compressional earthquakes in zones near the  trench
              and towards the outer rise as signals of the maturity of the  earthquake cycle
              of the thrust interface.  This research is a  component of the National
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
