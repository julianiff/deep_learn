Abstract    :
              9614521  Paterson   Mineral lineations are commonly observed in ductilely
              deformed crustal rocks, and they potentially record considerable kinematic
              information.  However, there is currently debate about the significance and
              interpretation of mineral lineations, including whether they record regional
              displacement directions, regional stretching directions or heterogeneous
              strain.  Flow partitioning and volume loss also are potential factors.  This
              project will use the well-studied Cascade Core of the mid-Cretaceous orogeny in
              the North Cascades Mountain of Washington to investigate the kinematic
              significance of mineral lineations formed at mid-crustal depths.  Successful
              results will be widely applicable to ductile deformation in many other orogens,
              may provide better procedures for understanding these lineations and allow
              further evaluation of flow fields in the mid crust.
