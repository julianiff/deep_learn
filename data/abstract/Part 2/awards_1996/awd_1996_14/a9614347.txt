Abstract    :
              9614347  Hilton  The presence of distinct reservoirs in the mantle as indicated
              by the geochemical and isotopic characteristics of ocean island basalts provide
              key constraints on the geodynamic history of the earth. This proposal seeks to
              characterize the He-Ne-Ar isotopic compositions and concentrations of samples
              from three ocean islands previously studied for their geochemical and Sr-Nd-Pb
              isotope systematics that show different mantle affinities: Heard Island
              (EM1/EM2), Iceland (DMM-FOZO), and La Palma, Canaries (HIMU).  The proposed
              work will search for rare gas differences between the different mantle source
              reservoirs and will consider the degree of coupling between rare gases and
              radiogenic isotopes. A specific aim will be to test the presence of a mantle
              component (FOZO or 'C') common to all three ocean islands.  If present, an
              attempt will be made to characterize its rare gas and radiogenic isotope
              systematics.  An important aspect of this work will be to compare the results
              obtained by measuring different sampling media (i.e. geothermal fluids, glass
              rims of basalts, and mafic phenocrysts) to evaluate their capabilities for
              preservation of features that are characteristic of the mantle source region or
              susceptibility to modification by upper-crustal (magma chamber) processes. 
              Another goal of this study will be to consider the integrity of the 'low-3He'
              hotspot signal found in some ocean islands to evaluate if this is a mantle
              feature or a crustal overprint introduced immediately prior to eruption in
              crustal magma chambers.
