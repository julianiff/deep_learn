Abstract    :
              9614365  Miller    This collaborative project proposes installation of a GPS 
              network in the Pacific Northwest to measure strain  accumulation and earthquake
              hazard in the region that is  associated with subduction of the Juan de Fuca
              plate.  Geodetic monitoring, combined with geologic studies and  geophysical
              modeling, should discriminate the relative  importance of the many factors
              contributing to the  deformation of this area.  The PIs will employ a matrix of
               permanent and roving GPS receivers in a project that  includes 1) site
              installation,  2) data acquisition,  reduction and archiving, and 3) modeling
              of the kinematic  results.  This work will be done in collaboration with other 
              agencies and governments (Canadian) operating under the  auspices of the
              Pacific Northwest Geodetic Array (PANGA), of  which the PIs are members.  A
              data analysis facility  developed at CWU will reduce and distribute on-line and
              CD  ROM geodetic data products to the geophysical community.  Finite-element
              modeling of the new constraints on Pacific  Northwest deformation will allow
              the development of both  kinematically consistent, two-dimensional estimates of
              the  surface deformation, and three-dimensional models of the  forces that
              drive that deformation.  The integrated approach  of field observations and
              modeling should provide an  advancement of understanding of the kinematics and
              dynamics  of the Pacific Northwest, and will provide important seismic 
              monitoring of this seismically active region.  ***
