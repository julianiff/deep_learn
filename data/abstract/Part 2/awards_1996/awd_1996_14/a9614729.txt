Abstract    :
              9614729  Finnemore      Technical   abstract:   The  1997  Gordon   Research  
              Conference   on  Superconductivity  will  devote one  week  to  the  research 
              area  of  superconductivity,  with emphasis on High Tc cuprate  materials.  
              The  focus  will  be  on  order parameter symmetry and  the  properties  of 
              vortices.  Other  topics  will  be discussed,  the  participants  will  include
                world  leaders  in  this  area.  The  conference   will   be 
              interdisciplinary,  and  will bring together leading  scientists  from 
              academia  and  industry  to critically assess  the  current  level  of 
              knowledge  and what remains to be learned in the future.  NSF  support  will
              provide financial assistance to young investigators.    Non-technical
