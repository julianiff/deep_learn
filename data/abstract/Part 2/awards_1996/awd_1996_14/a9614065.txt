Abstract    :
              9614065  Scholz    This grant provides $130,000 as partial support of the costs
              of  upgrading Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory's rock mechanics  laboratory and
              partial salary support for a laboratory  technician.  Specifically, these funds
              will be used to purchase  equipment necessary to upgrade their current triaxial
              press for  high temperature duty, including a new gas medium servo  controlled
              confining pressure system and construction of a fluid  separator system so that
              hot fluids are kept independently  contained from cold fluids and at constant
              temperature.  This  system will be used for short term studies (4 days) of rock
               deformation under hydrothermal conditions.  For longer term  (several month)
              deformation experiments, five inexpensive  triaxial presses systems will be
              built that are relatively  insensitive to power outages and will be used for
              studies of  chemical/mechanical induced pressure solution.  This equipment 
              will allow the PI to continue cutting edge research on the impact  of solution
              transport deformation on fault zone rheology and to  document the effects of
              diagenetic precipitation and dissolution  in the presence of reactive fluids
              under deviatoric stress on  permeability in sedimentary and fractured igneous
              and metamorphic  rocks.  ***
