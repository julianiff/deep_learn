Applications of advanced artificial composite materials, in which
              photonic bands and band-gaps can be controlled though an external current,
              voltage bias or light source, require that implant sizes and lattice constants
              be comparable to at least a wavelength.  For these cases, conventional
              effective medium approaches are inadequate.  In this research, a double
              vector-integral equation (DOVIE) method for modeling of radiators and
              scatterers within advanced dielectric materials is proposed for first time
              development and implementation.  The first integral equation formulation is to
              find the electromagnetic fields within the implants due to an array of sources.
               The second integral equation formulation is to find the currents or fields at
              the antennas or scatterers.  The DOVIE methodology applies to general periodic
              structures with abnormalities, and will allow investigation of many interesting
              new phenomena of printed circuits and antennas involving advanced artificial
              materials.  Expected applications include printed antennas with high
              directivity, high gain, multifunctionality and beam steering through
              controllable artificial material overlay; electromagnetic shielding provided by
              photonic band-gap material coatings on millimeter wave integrated circuits in
              which the conductor is too lossy for a desired frequency range (potentially
              very useful in integrated circuits); and DOVIE + CAD design of specialty
              integrated circuit components such as filters, directional couplers and
              interconnects.
