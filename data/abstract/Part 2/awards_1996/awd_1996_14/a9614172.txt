Abstract    :
              The title of this workshop is Parallel Unstructured Mesh Computations.  The goal
              is to bring together leading researchers to design new, fundamental algorithms
              and software infrastructure that provide an integrated approach to parallel
              unstructured mesh computation.  An important focus is on moving the basic
              computer science and mathematics research developments into the application
              arena, while simultaneously fertilizing the basic research with the ideas and
              difficulties that arise in real application codes.  This workshop is being
              organized by the University of Tennessee and will take place September 9-11,
              1996 at the Argonne National Laboratory, in Argonne, IL.
