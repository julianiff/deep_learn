Abstract    :
              9614738  Gwynne    The Wildlife Conservation Society will develop "Congo Gorilla
               Forest."  This will be a 6.5 acre outdoor exhibit that will provide  visitors
              with a realistic trip through a living Congo Ecosystem,  ending in an
              arms-length observation of a colony of 30 Lowland  Gorillas living in a natural
              setting.  The science presented in  this exhibit is based on much of the
              seminal research that has been  carried out on the Congo Forest environment by
              scientists at the  Zoo.  During their trip visitors will be able to explore and
               develop their own insights into this dynamic ecosystem and at the  end will be
              drawn into difficult conservation issues.  The exhibit  will include the Rain
              Forest Trail, Living Treasures of the Congo  Gallery, Conservation Showcase and
              Theater, Great Apes Gallery, and  the Conservation Choices Pavilion.  In
              addition there will be a  menu of complementary formal education materials to
              include parent  workshops, teacher training activities, and instructional 
              materials.  Linkages have been made with the New York Urban  Systemic
              Initiative and the formal education programs will  complement the goals of this
              systemic initiative.  Given the Zoo's  location in the Bronx, given the Zoo's
              reputation as a leader in  wildlife conservation, and given the Zoo's renewed
              commitment to  quality visitor experience and learning activities, this exhibit
               will break new ground in the exhibition of animals and informal  learning
              activities of visitors.  It will have an impact on zoos  throughout the world. 
              They anticipate 750,000 visitors annually  for the Congo Gorilla Forest.
