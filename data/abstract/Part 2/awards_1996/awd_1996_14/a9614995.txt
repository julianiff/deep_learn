Abstract    :
                Early Prehistoric Occupation of Southwestern Alaska    This project analyzes
              archeological data recovered from the late Pleistocene to early Holocene sires
              in southwestern Alaska.  The materials cover about 5000 years and four discrete
              cultural traditions including Paleoindian, Paleoarctic, an intermediate
              tradition, and Northern Archaic.  The project focuses on the delineation of the
              cultural traditions and their adaptive strategies reflected in the site
              locations, types, and associated cultural assemblages.  This work will provide
              further insights into the movement of Asian peoples and cultures into North
              America and illuminate the prehistory of Beringia.
