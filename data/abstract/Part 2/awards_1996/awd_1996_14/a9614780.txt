Abstract    :
              9614780  Wernicke   The southern  Great Basin, western US, is among the most
              highly extended regions in the world, and has been the site of the development
              of concepts of extreme extension and models of how extension is compensated. 
              Previous research has led to the development of a large-scale three-dimensional
              kinematic model of the evolution of the southern Great Basin since 36 Ma.  The
              model makes numerous detailed predictions regarding the compatibility of
              structural, stratigraphic, paleothermal and paleomagnetic signatures between
              various specific blocks.  This project will test aspects of this model in the
              northern Spring Mountains and the Grapevine Mountains.  Results are expected to
              help established the applicability of the overall model to the southern.
