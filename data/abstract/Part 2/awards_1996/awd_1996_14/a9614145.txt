Abstract    :
              This wide ranging research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface
              Chemistry  Program, addresses the fundamentals of ion/surface interactions,
              with the goal of developing  and implementing surface analytical techniques. 
              During the tenure of this three-year standard  grant, Professor Winograd and
              his students at the Pennsylvania State University will carry  out measurements
              of energy and angle resolved distributions of atoms and molecules  desorbed
              from ion bombarded surfaces.  Postionization of the desorbed neutral species
              will  be used to develop molecular surface imaging techniques.  Theoretical
              modelling of these  processes will be closely coupled with the detailed
              experimental information obtained in these  investigations.  Applications of
              these methods to surface structural analysis, compositional  imaging of
              surfaces, and characterization of electronic materials will be stressed.  The
              use of ion beam methods to analyze surface structure and composition is the
              focus of  this research project.  Detailed measurements of the energy and
              angular distribution of  sputtered ions and neutrals will be coupled with
              theoretical modelling of these processes in  order to develop the understanding
              necessary to implement these methods as molecularly  sensitive surface imaging
              tools.  Applications to a wide range of problems in the areas of  electronic
              device manufacture, pharmaceutical discovery, and structural biochemistry are 
              expected as a result of this work.
