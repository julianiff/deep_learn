Abstract    :
              9614849  Parris  Ongoing developments in xerography and in electroluminiscent 
              display devices require a detailed understanding of charge  transport in
              molecularly doped solids.  This grant, part of  a collaboration between two
              groups at the University of  Missouri-Rolla and at the University of New Mexico
              is to  support research on this subject.  The primary issues, to be  addressed
              are the effects of disorder and high electric  fields on carrier motion in
              polymeric films.  The specific  projects include, inter alia, the
              identification of the  charge carriers, study of the field induced traps, 
              determination of the time and length scales for the  equilibration of carriers
              following photoexcitation and  several other issues necessary to clarify the
              physical  mechanism behind the phenomena.  %%%  Xerography and
              electroluminescent display devices use doped  molecular solids (for example
              polymer films).  The basic  physical phenomena involving photoconduction, i.e.
              charging  and currents following absorption of light, contains several 
              unanswered questions.  This grant is to support theoretical  work to elucidate
              the fundamental processes which account  for the phenomena, and possibly to
              help design materials  which are better photoconductors.  The grant is being 
              awarded to two groups, one at the University of New Mexico  and another at the
              University of Missouri-Rolla for a  collaborative enterprise.  ***
