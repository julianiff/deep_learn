Abstract    :
              9614789  Rubin       This research is to build on recent success with precise
              earthquake locations at Kilauea, Hawaii, to learn more about the interaction
              between magmatic and tectonic processes within the volcano.  Seismicity
              combined with high deformation rates and good geodetic coverage permit
              quantitative interpretation of the earthquake relocation results using two- and
              three-dimensional elastic boundary element models.  Earlier relocations from
              the volcano's east rift in 1991 delineate a left-lateral strike-slip fault zone
              that is 2.5 km long but only 100 m tall over much of its length.  Both this
              remarkable ribbon-like geometry and the long-term pattern of moment release are
              in quantitative agreement with a mechanical model in which the rift-zone stress
              was "reset" by dike intrusion in 1982, and subsequently loaded by
              geodetically-inferred motion of Kilauea's deep rift.  These types of models are
              of importance to estimation of earthquake hazards in this seismically active
              zone.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
              Program.  ***  ??
