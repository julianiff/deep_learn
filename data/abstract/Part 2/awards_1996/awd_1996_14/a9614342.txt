Abstract    :
              9614342  Mueller   A number of exotic terranes evolved between the time of
              break-up of Rodinia and the amalgamation of Gondwanaland.  Traditional terrane
              analysis techniques are difficult to apply in the attempt to reconstruct these
              terrane in their proper neoproterozoic places, due to their age and
              predominance of magmatic rocks.  This project involves extensive elemental,
              isotopic and geochronlogic characterization of neoproterozoic and younger rocks
              of the Carolina terrane in North Carolina, to test the suggestion that the
              Carolina terrane has a Grenvillian to a segment and has magmatic rocks as young
              as early Paleozoic.  Results will improve the age and isotopic data base
              required to define terrane placement in the context of the Rodinia-Pangea
              supercontient cycle.
