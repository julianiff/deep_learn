Abstract    :
              9614612  Liebermann    Phase transformations in mantle minerals at high
              pressures and  temperatures strongly influence the physical properties and 
              dynamic processes in the Earth's interior.  The PI proposes to  perform
              ultrasonic measurements on high-pressure mantle phases to  determine their
              elastic properties at both high P, and  simultaneous high P-T conditions that
              exist in the Earth's  transition zone.  The data will be used to improve and
              refine  mineralogical models of the mantle through comparisons with  seismic
              velocity data.  This research program takes advantage of  the special
              opportunities provided by the multi-anvil, large-  volume facilities of the
              Stony Brook High Pressure Laboratory and  the associated analytical facilities
              of the NSF Science and  Technology Center for High Pressure Research (CHiPR).
