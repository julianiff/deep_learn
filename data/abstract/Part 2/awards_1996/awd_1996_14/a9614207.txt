Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:  CTS-9614207  PI: Argrow     This is an SGER grant
              to develop advanced computational methods for dense gases that display
              non-classical behavior.  Recent numerical simulations of transient shock tube
              flows and steady flows of dense gases over airfoils display a number of
              phenomena that have not been previously observed either experimentally or
              computationally. The utilization of this non-classical behavior in practical
              applications has been the subject of debate for many years.  The most obvious
              application is the use of this class of fluids as the working fluid in a
              Rankine cycle for power generation where efficiency could be improved. the
              focus of the computational technique will be on developing coupled
              thermodynamic equations of state/fluid dynamic algorithms.
