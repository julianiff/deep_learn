Abstract    :
              9614076  Conley   Net shape aluminum casting and their production applications
              have gained a great attention by companies in the U.S. and Mexico.  As
              government regulation forces automotive manufacturers to reduce weight and
              improve fuel efficiency, the suitability of aluminum alloys to replace ferrous
              materials become more attractive.  This collaborative research project
              addresses fundamental issues on the design and microstructural characterization
              of near net shape aluminum alloy castings between  Northwestern University  and
              the Institute Politecnico Nacional in Mexico. Under the NSF CONACyT
              Collaborative Research Project Initiatives, NSF supports international
              collaborative research activities in the areas where efforts are likely to
              produce complementary and synergistic effects.   The research project has a 
              balance between theory and experiment,  and will provide valuable findings for
              the aluminum alloy casting industry.
