Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9614126  WELLER  U. ALASKA    The proposal is a request for
              support of a symposium "A synthesis and analysis of the regional impacts of
              global change in the western Arctic/Bering Sea".  The symposium will provide a
              forum for multidisciplinary discussion of the nature and magnitude of changes
              in the Western Arctic/Bering Sea region as a consequence of global change
              through prediction and assessment of the consequences of these changes on the
              physical, biological, and socio-economic systems in the region, determination
              of the cumulative impacts of these changes on the region, including assessment
              of past impacts; and investigation of possible policy options to mitigate these
              cumulative impacts.  A series of synthesis workshops are proposed in which the
              key questions and issues will be addressed.  The symposium will bring together
              a large number of scientists, policy-makers, and local people for the purposes
              of identifying critical issues likely to be very important in understanding the
              dimensions of global change on the Bering Sea ecosystem.
