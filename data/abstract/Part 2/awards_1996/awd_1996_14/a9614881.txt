Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT: CMS-9614881, Charles Meade, Committee on  Seismology    The current
              activities of the Committee on Seismology of the  National Research Council
              consists of: (1 ) conducting two  meetings of the committee each year; (2)
              proposing and  planning a series of workshops on regional earthquake  hazards
              in coordination with a major study on the Science of  Earthquakes; (3)
              continuing a panel to review methodologies  for estimating probabilistic
              earthquake hazards; (4)  initiating a panel to review the role of seismic, 
              hydroacoustic, infrasonic, and radionuclide research in the  proposed
              Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; and (5) publishing a  report of a workshop on
              high-performance computing needs in  seismology.    This action is for partial
              support of this committee for a  period of one year.
