Abstract    :
                                                This award from the Chemistry Research
              Instrumentation and Facilities Program will assist the  Department of Chemistry
              at the University of Colorado at Boulder to acquire an automated solid-  phase
              peptide synthesizer and a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC).  This 
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following:
              (1) studies  utilizing peptides to probe intermolecular tuning of protein
              signaling, (2) studies of the structural  ramifications of glycosylation on
              peptide conformation, (3) synthesis and characterization of  phosphopeptide
              analogues, (4) structural characterization of the protein folding intermediates
              and  protein design, and (5) studies of the MAP kinase signal transduction
              pathway.      The peptide synthesizer and the high performance liquid
              chromatograph (HPLC) are used by  biological scientists to make and purify
              analogs of the natural substrates/effectors of a variety  of proteins.
