Abstract    :
              9614969  Friedman  This award is for support for a one year study to further 
              test the use of bacteria preserved in permafrost, as  indicators of
              paleoclimate at the time the sediments were  deposited and frozen.  Changes in
              climate, especially major  ones, are thought to be recognizable in the
              bacterial  fingerprints of the sediment layers.  A one year pilot  project was
              conducted in which drilling was performed and  cores were collected at a number
              of sites in the McMurdo Dry  Valleys region of Antarctica.  Viable bacteria and
              bacterial  products (methane and enzymes) were found in the cores.  The  ice
              content of all samples was unexpectedly high (at least  25% and up to over
              50%).  These results provide strong  support to the idea that Martian
              permafrost may contain  ground ice and that ancient permafrost on Mars may
              contain  samples-possibly viable-of life forms from an earlier,  wetter period.
               Continued analyses of the existing core  samples will be undertaken in this
              project
