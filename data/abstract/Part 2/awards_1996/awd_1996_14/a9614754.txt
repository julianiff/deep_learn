Abstract    :
              9614754  Rhodes  The primary aim of this project is to provide insights into the
              processes of magma generation within the Hawaiian mantle plume using the
              geochemical and isotopic composition of samples from Mauna Loa, a volcano with
              one of the best-documented prehistoric eruptive geochronologies.  This goal
              will be achieved by completing the geochemical database on a group of samples
              from Mauna Loa that have been previously analysed with 14C.  The intent of this
              proposal is to utilize this unique record to provide detailed documentation of
              both long- and short-term geochemical variations in Mauna Loa's eruptive
              history.  This information will allow the determination of periods of cyclical
              activity in the eruptive record where the magma supply rate appears to have
              changed dramatically.  Samples from critical periods, selected on the basis of
              XRF data, will be analysed for additional trace elements by INAA, and for Sr
              and Pb isotopic compositions.  The results of this work will be used to
              evaluate long-term geochemical and isotopic trends from the perspectives seen
              in the short-term data, and to provide answers to questions of the nature and
              evolution of the plume source over time.
