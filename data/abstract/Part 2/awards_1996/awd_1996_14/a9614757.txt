Abstract    :
              9614757  Anderson  This research involves the study of the January 17, 1995,
              HyogoKen Nambu earthquake (Mw=6.9), commonly referred to as the Kobe earthquake
              in the United States.  The earthquake was particularly destructive because the
              fault ruptured into a densely developed urban area.  This is to be an
              integrated study of the factors that controlled the nature of the ground
              motions and caused the disaster:  the earthquake source, wave propagation along
              the path, and near-surface modification of these motions at nearsurface sites. 
              The area affected by the earthquake was well instrumented for strong ground
              motion.  The earthquake focal mechanism was predominantly strike slip.  Thus,
              the ground motions may be analogous to what should be expected from earthquakes
              of this size on strike-slip faults such as the San Andreas in the United
              States.  The work will be done in collaboration with Japanese scientists at the
              Disaster Prevention Research Institute, Kyoto University, in Japan.  This
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
