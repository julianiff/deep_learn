Abstract    :
              9614267  Zoback    The PI proposes to analyze data from the 9 km KTB borehole to
               better understand the relationships among depth, lithology,  the contemporary
              in situ stress field, and the mobility of  crustal fluids. The work will
              investigate tectonic controls  on permeability and permeability anisotropy
              through a crustal  section that approaches the depth of the brittle-ductile 
              transition.  The project will include measurements of the  distribution and 
              orientation of faults and fractures penetrated by both the  main KTB borehole
              and the KTB pilot hole (drilled to 9 and 4  km, respectively), a study of their
              hydrologic properties  through comparison with fracture-related thermal and
              flow  anomalies, and finally an attempt to relate the relatively  permeable
              fractures with the current stress field.  By  documenting systematic
              relationships between fracture  orientation and hydrologic properties, the PI
              expects  to  provide a framework for interpretation of hydraulic  properties to
              9100 m.  ***
