Abstract    :
              In this RUI project funded by Experimental Physical Chemistry in the   Chemistry
              Division, Prof. Berberian (St. Joseph's College) will study   molecular
              relaxation in simple glass-forming polar liquids and mixtures   using both
              dielectric and heat capacity measurements.  The two techniques   complement
              each other and will help understand the interactions involved   between
              components of mixtures of organic liquids, particularly the   relaxation
              processes.  Results of these data will contribute to   explaining the behavior
              of more complex systems.  The work is to be   carried out with the aid of
              undergraduate assistants, who will benefit by   exposure to modern research
              equipment and methodology.  %%%  Some molecules possess tiny electric dipole
              moments. By dissolving such   molecules in mixtures of electrically inert
              species of similar size and   shape, and making the solution part of an
              electric circuit, it is   possible to use variations in current to study how
              the surroundings of a   molecule influence its rotational motion.  This is
              important because at   low temperatures where the motion becomes extremely
              sluggish, detailed   understanding of the intermolecular forces is absent.
              Prof. Beberian's   project in this area will lead to an improved undertanding
              of this   `glassy` state of matter.
