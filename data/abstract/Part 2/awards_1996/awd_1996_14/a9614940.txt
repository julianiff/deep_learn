Abstract    :
              9614940  Amemiya      The Hox genes exist as highly conserved gene clusters
              within the chordates.  The protochordate, Amphioxus, has a single gene cluster,
              while the mammals, birds, and fishes have four.  The Hox genes play an
              important role in embryogenesis, specifying developmental  identities along the
              anterior/posterior axis.  Drs. Ruddle, Wagner, and Amemiya will determine by
              direct testing whether intermediate forms such as cyclostomes and 
              elasmobranchs have intermediate cluster numbers and whether cluster duplication
              occurred once or several times independently during Chordate evolution.  They
              will also determine whether different clades posses different Hox gene numbers,
              and if the loss or gain of  genes has been the same or different.  Differences
              and similarities in Hox gene composition will be correlated with the
              developmental status of the different species examined.  They will study
              particular Hox orthologous genes in detail, especially examining similarities
              and differences in enhancer structure and function on a comparative basis.  By
              these approaches, they hope to better understand the relationship between
              developmental regulation and evolutionary process.
