Abstract    :
              9614726  Isachsen   A large area of southern Arizona is underlain by a family of
              rocks called the Pinal Schist terrane.  These rocks are poor understood, and
              this inhibits the regional syntheses of Precambrian tectonics.  Isachsen's
              proposal requests funds to characterize there rocks by isotope geochemical and
              dating methods.  The results will help establish whether the rocks of this
              terrane correlate to adjacent terranes, or whether they constitute a new unique
              crustal block.   This in-turn will constrain models for the tectonic
              development of the SW United States.
