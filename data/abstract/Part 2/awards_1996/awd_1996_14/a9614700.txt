Abstract    :
              Abstract/Balsley 9614700          We propose to use the Jicamarca Radio
              Observatory near Lima, Peru  to examine a variety of multiple-receiver
              techniques that can be used for  vertical wind measurements in the troposphere
              and lower stratosphere.   These studies will use a series of sub-modules of the
              Jicarmarca antenna in  conjunction with a number of receivers.  The
              observations require only  low-power transmitters and minimal hands-on
              operation.  We will  intercompare a number of existing (and some new)
              techniques in order to  assess their strengths and weaknesses for vertical wind
              measurement.   The  Jicamarca observations will be complemented by modeling
              studies.   We anticipate that our results could ultimately serve as a basis for
               improving conventional wind profiling techniques to provide improved  vertical
              wind measurements.
