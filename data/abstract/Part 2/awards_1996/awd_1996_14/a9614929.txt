                        SUMMARY                CTS-9614929                C.D. Han            
                 University of Akron            A fundamental study is being conducted on
              binary blends of main-chain thermotropic semiflexible polyester (MTSP) and
              flexible polyester.  Emphasis will be placed on developing a method(s) whereby
              an enhancement of the mechanical properties of flexible polyesters can be
              realized by blending with a MTSP.  It is proposed to synthesize a series of
              MTSP with lateral substitution, and then prepare binary blends with a
              commercially available flexible polyester, poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT)
              or polycarbonate (PC).  Using various blends of MTSP and PBT (or PC), which
              will be prepared during the course of the proposed study, the investigation
              will include:  (1) thermal transitions using differential scanning calorimetry
              (DSC); (2) equilibrium phase behavior in the nematic region of MTSP using DSC
              and polarizing optical microscopy; (3) transient/steady-state shear flow and
              oscillatory shear flow behavior in both the isotropic and nematic regions of
              MTSP using a cone-and-plate rheometer; (4) the structure in the nematic and
              solid states, respectively, using variable-temperatures wide-angle X-ray
              diffractometry; and (5) the mechanical properties of fabricated specimens.  The
              primary objective of the proposed research project is to establish phase
              behavior-rheology-morphology-property relationships in binary blends consisting
              of a flexible polyester and a main-chain thermotropic semiflexible polyester
              (MTSP).
