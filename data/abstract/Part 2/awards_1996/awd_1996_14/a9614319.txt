Abstract    :
                  This dissertation project is a village level study of environmental thought
              and practice in the Kluane region of Canada's Yukon Territory.  In the past
              decade, studies have tried to understand or document "traditional ecological
              knowledge" for use in resource management efforts, environmental impact
              assessments and land claims negotiations.  However, this project argues that
              that knowledge is not simply an abstract product of the human intellect, but is
              one aspect of broader cultural processes that are embedded in complex networks
              of social relations and practices.  By approaching land use in the Kluane area
              from this perspective, the project goes beyond traditional knowledge studies
              and considers how environmental knowledge and practice are changing and what
              these changes mean for local people and resources.  The study uses participant
              observation, interviews, and archival/library research to examine traditional
              ecological knowledge as a process.
