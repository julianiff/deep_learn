Abstract    :
              9614407  Vander Pluijm   Clay-bearing gouge rocks are commonly associated with
              the shallow crustal segments of faults.  The processes that lead to clay gouge
              formation have direct implications for the mechanical properties and strength
              of shallow-crustal faults.  However, detailed studies of natural gouge have
              been limited, which stems in part from the very fine grain size that
              characterizes clay gouge.  This study will attempt to determine mechanical and
              chemical processes during clay-gouge formation, with emphasis on deformation
              fabrics, effects of fluid interaction and clay mineral transformation, using
              techniques applicable to very fine grained materials.  Results are expected to
              clarify how clay gouge forms in shallow portions of faults.
