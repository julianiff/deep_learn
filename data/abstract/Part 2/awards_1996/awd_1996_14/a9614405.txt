Abstract    :
              9614405  De Silva  It is proposed to conduct a petrological and geochemical
              study of the volcanic products of the little-known but potentially globally
              significant 1600 A.D. eruption of Huaynaputina (southern Peru).  This eruption
              resulted in complete destruction of the local communities and caused a
              breakdown of the socioeconomic fabric over a large area of southern Peru for
              over a century.  On a broader scale, the magnitude of this eruption is
              consistent with previous speculative correlations with major perturbations of
              the environment in the early 17th century recorded in proxy records.  Specific
              objectives of this study are to elucidate the nature and magnitude of the
              eruption, characterize and decipher the petrological and geochemical properties
              of the magma, and assess the possible global impact of the eruption. These
              objective will be realized through a multi-faceted approach involving field
              mapping, documentation and sampling of products, physical volcanology and bulk
              through microscale petrology and geochemistry.  A particular effort to evaluate
              the pre-eruption volatile budget from studies of glass inclusions in
              phenocrysts will also be made.
