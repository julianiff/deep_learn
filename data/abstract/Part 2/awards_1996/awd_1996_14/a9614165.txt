Abstract    :
              9614165  Ripley  In order to better understand the processes involved in the
              development of hydrothermal flow systems associated with continental
              rift-related magmas, a detailed oxygen and hydrogen isotopic study is planned,
              to be augmented by radiogenic isotopic analyses where competing processes may
              have produced similar stable isotopic signatures. Results of a one-year pilot
              study indicate that above the Duluth Complex hydrothermal fluid flow was
              channeled in the North Shore Volcanic Group within permeable flow tops and
              bottoms, and possibly along the contact of sills within the Proterozoic
              sedimentary rocks below the Complex. Additional O and H isotopic measurements
              of sills located both above and below the Complex are planned to better define
              the nature of the hydrothermal circulation system association with emplacement
              of the Duluth Complex and hypabyssal intrusives. Modeling of isotopic exchange
              and reactions will be pursued based on temperature constrains, flow parameters,
              and water/rock ratios, and both equilibrium and kinetic fractionation. Some Sr,
              Nd and Pb isotopic analyses are planned. Potential variations in radiogenic
              isotope values as a function of alteration and intensity of water-rock
              interaction will also be determined. Results will be of particular significance
              to the interpretation of possible origins of platinum-group element
              mineralization in the Duluth Complex and will lead to a better understanding of
              crust-magma interaction in rift environments worldwide.
