Abstract    :
              9614330  Fink  The proposed research will combine field observations,
              theoretical analyses, and laboratory simulations to characterize and quantify
              the physical processes that accompany the interactions of lava flows and
              glacial ice.  The resulting models will be used to calculate the quantities,
              timing, and locations of melt water likely to be generated by future eruptions
              of lava at the summits and flanks of glaciated volcanoes.  The initial
              application will be to Mount Rainier, Washington, where the most probable
              eruptive activity would involve lava flows in the vicinity of glacial ice and
              snow, and where concerted efforts at hazards assessment by members of the U.S.
              Geological Survey and other researchers are ongoing.  Laboratory simulations
              will use polyethylene glycol wax injected into cold water to reproduce the
              types of structures and textures generated when lava solidifies in contact with
              ice.  These models should allow the textures and morphologies of the lava flows
              to be used to deduce their eruption rates.
