Abstract    :
              9614136  Zhdanov    Electromagnetic (EM) probing of the earth is one of the 
              major tools for surveying underground structures and the  technique is used to
              map the earth from the crust to the  mantle.  Applications include geological
              mapping, mineral  and oil prospecting, tectonic and earthquake studies, and 
              environmental assessment and monitoring.  One of the most  difficult problems
              of EM geophysical methods is the  interpretation of EM data in areas with 3-D
              geo-electrical  structures because of limitations of 3D forward modeling  codes
              and ill-posedness of inversion procedures.  Currently  available EM techniques
              can handle only simple models and  require supercomputer processing.  The PI
              proposes to  develop fast and stable 3-D geo-EM inversion methods that  can be
              applied to real geophysical data using conventional  PCs or Workstations using
              new methods based on quasi-linear  approximations of the existing integral
              equation algorithms.  ***
