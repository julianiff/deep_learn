Abstract    :
                  The proposal is a request for support ($ 73,381) of graduate student
              attendance at the 27th, 28th, and 29th Arctic Workshops.  These workshops are
              scheduled to be held at the University of Ottawa (1997), the University of
              Colorado (1998), and probably the University of Washington (1999).  The funds
              requested will support Graduate Student registration, hotel, and meals for four
              nights.  The PI anticipates on the basis of prior graduate student attendance
              in years 1994 - 1996 that each workshop will be attended by 30 - 40 graduate
              students from the US, Canada, and several European countries.
