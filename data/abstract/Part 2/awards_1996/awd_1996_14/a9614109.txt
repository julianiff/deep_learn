Abstract    :
              9614109  Campbell  This is a proposal that aims at studying the mineral pyrite
              using transmitted near infrared light microscopy.  This technique has only
              recently been applied successfully with other less common opaque ore minerals
              such as wolframite, enargite, and molybdenite.  Preliminary data show that
              pyrite displays a number of internal features including fluid inclusions, solid
              inclusions, growth banding, and shear planes.  In this study, it will also be
              assessed if  the variable transparency of pyrite is controlled, as in other
              minerals, by trace element variations.  Fluid inclusion studies using this
              technique may be able to provide information on the conditions of pyrite
              mineralization.  In order to maximize the potential for making
              microthermometric measurements on pyrite, variations in transparency controlled
              by chemical impurities, thickness and temperature need to be understood.  A
              better understanding of the IR transparency of pyrite will allow new
              opportunities to use pyrite in petrological studies to determine its geological
              origin.
