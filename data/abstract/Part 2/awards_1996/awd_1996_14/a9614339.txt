Abstract    :
              9614339  Liggett    Nebraskans for Public Television is developing the math
              strand in Reading Rainbow.  Under this grant, the project will "re-purpose" 30
              existing Reading Rainbow program for use in mathematics learning, produce two
              new math-focused programs, and institute a comprehensive outreach campaign. 
              Books currently being considered for the new programs are Mama Bear, which
              looks at money and its uses and examines some simple economics; and Echoes for
              the Eye which explores patterns in nature.  The outreach will solicit and
              involve families served by the National Urban League; recruit school and
              community-based children's librarians in the math-based literature effort; and
              expand the local public broadcasting outreach efforts related to the math focus
              of the series from the eight model stations in the previous year to all
              interested public television stations.  The target will be to involve at least
              75 stations in substantive outreach to families and schools.  The project also
              will develop and disseminate a new print piece modeled after the very
              successful Math is Everywhere Reading Rainbow Teachers Guide which has been
              used by over 3,000 teachers.     Twila Liggett will continue as Executive
              Producer and Project Manager and LeVar Burton will remain as host and
              Co-Executive Producer.  Cecily and Larry Truett will be Supervising Producer
              and Producer/Director respectively.  Advisors include Herbert Ginsburg from
              Teachers College, Columbia University;  Lucille Mahon, Math Coordinator, NYC
              Community School District 2; Solomon Garfunkel, Executive Director, COMAP,
              Inc.; and Judith Jacobs, Director of the Center for Education and Equity in
              Mathematics, Science, and Technology at California State Polytechnic
              University.
