Abstract    :
              9614228  Morrissey  Pressure and seismic records are to be studied in order to
              determine their usefulness for monitoring activity at explosive volcanoes such
              as Sakurajima in Japan and those of the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. Eruptions
              at these volcanoes are classic examples of discrete,  explosive events that
              violently eject blocks of fragmented lava and generate pressure disturbances in
              the atmosphere.  Many of these eruptions are accompanied by shallow earthquakes
              (tremor episodes) lasting several minutes.  The source of the pressure
              disturbances and seismic events has been hypothesized to be related to the
              eruption but never demonstrated successfully. The intent of this project is to
              formulate a computer model that simulates the movement of high pressure fluid
              discharging from a volcano and the response of the volcano to the discharging
              fluid.  The results from these simulations will demonstrate how parts of
              pressure and seismic waveforms may be used to estimate  eruption pressures, gas
              and particle concentrations in the eruption cloud, and the  geometry and
              physical properties of the volcanic conduit.  Applications of the computer code
              include modelling the pressure and seismic disturbances recorded within several
              kilometers from active vents at Sakurajima volcano and several Alaskan
              volcanoes such as Iliamna and Pavlof.
