Abstract    :
              9614272  Bodnar    This grant provides $54,408 as partial support of the costs
              of  upgrading the hydrothermal facility at Virginia Tech.  Much of  the
              requested equipment will be manufactured in-house, such as  the re-building of
              furnaces for cold-seal bombs and replacing  valves and adding transducers to
              the cold-seal setups to allow  continuous monitoring of pressure during
              experiments.  Upgrade of  this facility will allow on of the top experimental
              hydrothermal  geochemists in the world and his students to continue their 
              productive research utilizing the novel technique of introducing  synthetic
              fluid inclusions in geological samples to be used as  indicators of the
              thermochemical conditions existing in three-  phase systems at elevated
              pressures.  These techniques have  application to ore body petrogenesis and
              tectonic studies.  ***
