Abstract    :
              9614682  Paterson   Convergent boundaries between tectonic plates involve such
              processes as crustal deformation metamorphism and magmatism.  The surficial
              counterparts to these internal processes include volcanism, high average
              elevation, topographic relief and rapid exhumation, but the connections between
              these surficial processes and the internal orogenic processes are enigmatic. 
              This project will address linked processes between orogeny and mountain
              building in a continental margin that has experienced a multifaceted tectonic
              history.  The Peninsular Ranges Baja California offers a well exposed set of
              tectonic assemblages within a manageable area that holds considerable promise
              for better understanding the connection between surface manifestation and
              internal orogenic processes.
