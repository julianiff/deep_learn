Abstract    :
                    9614736  Brown    MSA will expand both its educational and research roles
              through a new venture that involves the Internet.  The MSA Council recently
              approved the creation of a new standing committee, referred to as the MSA
              Outreach Committee, to coordinate the development of MSA Internet resources and
              to begin an outreach effort designed to enlist the help of MSA members and
              others in identifying and developing these resources.  MSA will hire an "MSA
              Coordinator of Internet Resources" who would be responsible for making
              mineralogical resources on the Internet more accessible to MSA members and
              others interested in the mineral sciences.  He or she would also be responsible
              for organizing existing educational resources and creating new ones that would
              appeal to students of all ages.
