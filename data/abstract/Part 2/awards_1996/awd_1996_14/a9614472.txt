Abstract    :
                    The purpose of this research is to provide information of the timing of
              initial occupations of the western Aleutian Islands, help identify the
              contemporaneity of groups living on Buldir and Attu, and provide a clearer
              cultural chronology by documenting well dated stylistic change in artifacts. 
              The research also includes gathering ethnographic and historical information
              from the remaining Attuans who once inhabited the western Aleutians. 
              Archaeological data combined with information from oral histories of the last
              surviving Attuans will shed light on the lifeways of some of the last
              hunters/gathers to inhabit the western Aleutians.
