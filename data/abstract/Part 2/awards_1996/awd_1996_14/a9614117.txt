Abstract    :
              This starter grant award to Columbia University supports the research of  
              Professor James L. Leighton.  The research targets the development of a   new
              class of chiral Lewis acid catalysts for the addition of a wide range   of
              nucleophiles to any aldehyde.  Hetero-bimetallic chiral Lewis acids   are
              designed and synthesized that simultaneously employ two binding   elements, a
              simultaneous sigma and pi binding, to control the addition of   nucleophiles to
              aldehydes.  Following synthesis of the catalysts, their   complexation
              reactions are studied in detail and the complexes fully   characterized
              spectroscopically.  The catalytic properties are optimized   by examination of
              various bimetal combinations.  The research impacts the field of asymmetric
              catalysis in a practical   way, in that new catalysts are made available for
              the asymmetric   synthesis of small organic molecules. In addition, the studies
              address   fundamental mechanistic questions about the nature of pi-bound  
              aldehyde-metal complexes.
