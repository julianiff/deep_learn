Abstract    :
              96-14447  Clement    The PI proposes a comprehensive paleomagnetic study of the 
              Cobb Mountain subchron with the objective of formulating  criteria to determine
              the quality of individual sediment and  volcanic recordings for any geomagnetic
              polarity transition.  Vocanic and sedimentary paleomagnetic records from
              several  locations will be studied to test the hypothesis that the  degree of
              smoothing of secular variation recorded during  full polarity intervals can be
              used to estimate the extent  to which the temporal resolution has been affected
              in  transitional intervals.  The results should provide  constraints on the
              temporal resolution of reversal records  and could serve as a useful
              quantitative guide for  estimating how much time resolution is provided by
              these  data.  ***
