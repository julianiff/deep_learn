Abstract    :
              9614376  Spera  This research will examine the rheology of multiphase silicate
              magmatic solid-liquid suspensions and gas-liquid emulsions as a function of
              shear rate, temperature, and disperse-phase volume fraction.  Specific
              experiments include viscometric measurements of emulsions of air bubbles in
              molten albite at up to 40 volume percent vapor and of artificially-created
              suspensions of diopside crystals in equilibrium with anorthite-diopside binary
              melts at up to 40 volume percent solids.  Authoritative experimental studies of
              the flow properties of multiphase magmatic systems remain quite scarce, and
              results obtained from the proposed experiments will lead to measurable progress
              in our comprehension of the complex rheological nature of  these materials. 
              This is essential if we are to understand the dynamics of magmatic systems and
              the natural hazards they pose.
