                OPP 9614928  Hammer    Abstract  This award supports continued research on
              Triassic and Jurassic  fossil vertebrates from the Transantarctic Mountains. 
              During the  1995/96 austral summer, a field team collected 120 new specimens 
              of Triassic vertebrates from sites near the Shackleton Glacier.  In previous
              seasons Triassic to Jurassic age vertebrates were  recovered from localities
              near the Beardmore Glacier.  This award  supports the continued preparation and
              study of these  collections, particularly the material collected recently.  The
               new fossils are all from the Early Triassic age lower Fremouw  Formation and
              they represent at least 12-16 different taxa,  several of which appear to be
              new.  Included are 15-20 partial to  complete skeletons and numerous additional
              skulls, jaws, and  other diagnostic pieces of numerous herbivorous and
              carnivorous  synapsids, small diapsids, procolophonid anapsids and 
              temnospondyl amphibians.  Preparation of most of the specimens is  required
              before more precise identifications can be made.  This  extensive amount of
              material will be used to determine whether  the greater diversity in
              assemblages found in the Shackleton  Glacier area compared to similar age
              collections made near the  Beardmore Glacier is due to climate or facies.  The
              Shackleton  localities are upland from the Beardmore vertebrate sites and the 
              climatic differences may have effected the relative diversity of  the faunas. 
              An interpretation of the taphonomic/depositional  settings for each locality
              will also be made.  Finally, studies  on the evolutionary significance of the
              high latitude vertebrate  faunas from the Mesozoic (Early Triassic, early
              Middle Triassic  and Early Jurassic) will continue.  Because vertebrates of 
              several different ages spanning the Triassic to Jurassic are now  known from
              Antarctica, they provide a unique opportunity to study  the evolution of high
              latitude faunas.  These faunas also  contribute to our understanding of high
              latitude climates during  this time.
