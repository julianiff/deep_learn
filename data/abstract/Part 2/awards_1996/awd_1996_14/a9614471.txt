Abstract    :
              9614471  DePaolo    The primary proposed research is aimed at further developing
              a new approach to U-Th-Pb geochronology, and assessing its applicability to
              ocean floor basalts.  The new technique may allow for improved understanding of
              the temporal framework of deep sea volcanism.  The proposed work involves
              precisely measuring 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb, and U/Pb and Th/Pb in mineral,
              glass and groundmass separates of selected submarine basalts to determine the
              applicability of the method.  The plan is to evaluate whether the necessary
              initial condition of uniform 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb is satisfied in
              oceanic basalts, and to compare the U-Pb and Th-Pb dates from the same rocks to
              Ar-Ar age determinations to establish its reliability.  Two other secondary
              projects will be pursued.  The first will use stratigraphic time-series data
              from basaltic lavas to quantitatively assess the hydrological properties of
              partial melt zones to better understand the role of melt zone dispersion and
              chromatography in the study of isotopic variations in the mantle.  The second
              project is aimed at verifying the evidence for fractionated mantle reservoirs
              in the early Archean mantle and quantifying approaches for reconstructing the
              initial isotopic and chemical compositions of metamorphosed Archean rocks.
