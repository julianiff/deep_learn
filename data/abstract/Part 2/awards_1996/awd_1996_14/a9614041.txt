Abstract    :
              ***  9614041  Belegundu  Mistree      This grant provides partial support to
              conduct a workshop on the use of optimization in industry, particularly in
              applications relating to engineering design.  The workshop will bring together
              engineers, mathematicians, operations research specialists, and researchers
              from academe to discuss current limitations on the applications of optimization
              and to provide a research agenda that could help to broaden current
              applications.  The discussion will also examine other roadblocks to the
              expanded use of optimization in industry and propose solutions to overcoming
              these roadblocks.  Representatives from the aerospace, automotive, civil,
              chemical, and mechanical disciplines of engineering will be invited.     
              Competitiveness of manufactured products often depends on design subtleties
              that are subject to optimization.  Optimization can enable products to perform
              better in use, be manufactured at lower cost, and have improved reliability and
              lower environmental impact.  To date, however, there has been a disconnect
              between the academic communities researching new optimization techniques and
              the industries that potentially would use them.  The result has been that the
              applications of optimization techniques in industry has substantially lagged
              the development of new methods.  This workshop seeks to bridge this gap and
              find ways to make current research in the field more applicable to industry,
              and to bring industry into the research agenda-setting process so that future
              advances are more relevant to the need of industry.    ***
