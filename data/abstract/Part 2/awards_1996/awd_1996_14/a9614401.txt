Abstract    :
                9614401  Dueker      This research involves the formation of images of the
              mantle  discontinuity structure beneath two important geologic transects:  one
              across the Tibetan Plateau and the other across the Cascadia  subduction zone. 
              This is done by means of common mid-point  stacks of source-normalized radial
              P-wave arrivals, i.e. receiver  functions.  Previous work with the 1993 Snake
              river Plain and  1992 Rocky Mountain Front PASSCAL arrays shows that this 
              technique of common mid-point stacking can significantly improve  the isolation
              of direct converted P to S arrivals from mantle  discontinuities with respect
              to single station stacks.  The  mantle structures under the Tibetan Plateau and
              Cascadia  subduction zones are important to interpretation of the present  day
              crustal forces and their evolutionary histories in these  seismically active
              areas.  This research is a component of the  National Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program.  ***
