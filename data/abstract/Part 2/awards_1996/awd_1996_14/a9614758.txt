Abstract    :
              9614758  Miller   Mineral lineations are commonly observed in ductilely deformed
              crustal rocks, and they potentially record considerable kinematic information. 
              However, there is currently debate about the significance and interpretation of
              mineral lineations, including whether they record regional displacement
              directions, regional stretching directions or heterogeneous strain.  Flow
              partitioning and volume loss also are potential factors.  This project will use
              the well-studied Cascade Core of the mid-Cretaceous orogeny in the North
              Cascades Mountain of Washington to investigate the kinematic significance of
              mineral lineations formed at mid-crustal depths.  Successful results will be
              widely applicable to ductile deformation in many other orogens, may provide
              better procedures for understanding these lineations and allow further
              evaluation of flow fields in the mid crust.
