Abstract    :
              This new three-year continuing grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program will  support studies of the fundamental growth mechanisms of self
              assembled monolayer (SAM)  systems.  Using scanning force microscopy and
              Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,  Professor Daniel Schwartz and his
              students at Tulane University will study model self-  assembling systems, with
              the goal of identifying and understanding the various processes  involved in
              the nucleation and growth of self-assembled monolayers.  Alkylphosphonic acid 
              monolayers on mica will serve as the model system, and results will be
              correlated with  further studies of SAM systems involving alkanethiols on gold
              surfaces.  Growth modes,  surface patterning and kinetic growth parameters will
              be investigated.  Self-assembled monolayer systems for the formation of organic
              thin films show promise in  possible molecular electronics applications, as
              possible corrosion inhibitors, and in various  other new materials
              applications.  Very little is known about the process of nucleation and  film
              growth in the self assembling systems.  This research project will probe these
              questions  using state of the art scanning probe microscopy and infrared
              spectroscopic methods.  A  basic understanding of film growth processes should
              result from this work, which will have  wide applicability in the synthesis and
              use of new materials.
