Abstract    :
              9614263  Bird   One of the underlying goals of geological research is to
              reconstruct tectonic and palinspastic circumstances at closely spaced time
              intervals, and to develop on understanding of the mechanism involved.  This
              project involves a new approach to geodynamic modeling, in that it attempts to
              develop a modeling algorithm that uses geologic observation to invert for the
              displacement field.  The work includes an extensive literature search for input
              to the model.  Results are expected to develop viable models for the tectonic
              development of North America since 85 ma, and to tighten the links between
              geologic research and geodynamic modeling.
