Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9614297  SERREZE, MARK  UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO      The research
              project will examine the fluctuations in fresh water input into the Arctic by
              utilizing output from historical weather prediction models in the Arctic as a
              means for predicting climate variables in the region. The model output will be
              validated using observed data. The resulting calibrated models of Arctic
              temperature and precipitation, for example, will be used to examine the
              relationship between climate variables and fresh water input, circulation
              fields, and sea ice extent. The results of this project will provide a very
              important set of predicted climate parameters for regions where observational
              data is scarce or absent. Therefore the output of the derived data will serve
              as input for other models that require closely-spaced observational data that
              is not available directly.
