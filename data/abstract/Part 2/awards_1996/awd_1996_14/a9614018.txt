Abstract    :
              Abstract  Senkan  9614018    The PI proposes to continue and extend his ongoing
              research program to include the investigation of trace by-products produced in
              the combustion of chlorinated hydrocarbons.  He points out the need to better
              understand the formation and fate of trace aromatic by-products formed in
              incineration processes in order to safely utilize this important technology. 
              In the experimental program, both premixed laminar flat flames and counter-flow
              jet diffusion flames of CH2Cl2, CHCl3, and CCl4 in mixtures with CH4  will be
              studied over a wide range of gas compositions, temperatures, and equivalence
              ratios characteristic of the operating conditions of incinerators (including
              failure modes).  In the case of the counter-flow jet diffusion flame
              experiments, the effects of gas composition and strain rate on the formation of
              trace aromatics will also be investigated.  The PI will make use of his
              previously developed diagnostic techniques in order to measure and characterize
              the trace halogenated aromatics and polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC)
              produced.  These techniques will include hot micro-probe sampling using high
              resolution gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS), and laser
              photoionization (LP) time of flight mass spectroscopy (REMPI/MS).  One primary
              focus of these experiments will be to further investigate the effects of the
              presence of soot on the levels of PAC formed in these flames.      A
              theoretical/analytical effort will also be pursued in which the development of
              detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms (DCKMs) as well as reduced chemical
              mechanisms describing the formation and destruction of the trace by-products
              will be undertaken.  These mechanistic results will be combined with
              appropriate flame models for comparison with measurements.  Dr. Sidney Benson
              of the University of Southern California and Dr. Carl Melius of the Sandia
              National laboratory will collaborate in the theoretical effort.  ***
