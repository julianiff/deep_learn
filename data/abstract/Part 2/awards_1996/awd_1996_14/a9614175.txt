Abstract    :
              9614175  Papitashvili  This project is the continuation of a joint U.S.-Russian 
              program to operate an array of high latitude automated  magnetometers in
              Antarctica.  These instruments will be  used to investigate polar cap current
              systems in the  Earth's magnetosphere.    The antarctic continent is uniquely
              suited to these  investigations because it is the only land mass at very  high
              latitudes, and is therefore an excellent and stable  location for an array of
              magnetometers.  These  investigations are particularly important to the 
              understanding of the coupling of energy and momentum from  the solar wind to
              the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and upper  atmosphere.  The data will also prove
              extremely useful for  analyses coordinated with a number of satellite-based 
              experiments that are currently in progress, or are planned  for the near
              future.    The specific tasks to be undertaken include design  improvements in
              the digital geomagnetic data acquisition  systems at Vostok and Mirny, and the
              continued operation  and maintenance of autonomous stations along the Russian 
              traverse route to Vostok.  One improvement will be to add a  satellite data
              transmission capability at the Vostok so  that a polar cap magnetic index will
              be available in near  real-time for space weather and research applications.
