Abstract    :
              9614250  Beck    This research ilvolves continued seismological study of the
              large-  scale structure of the central Andes with existing data from the 
              recently completed BANJO/SEDA passive seismic deployments using  PASSCAL
              instrumentation.  The central Andes, in western Bolivia and  northern Chile,
              are among the highest and widest mountain belts in  the world with elevations
              locally over 6000 m, crustal thicknesses  up to  75 km, and deformation
              extending inland nearly 1000 km.  The  research involves use of a combination
              of receiver function  analysis and regional waveform modeling from events in
              the down-  going slab to determine a three-dimensional "seismic snapshot" of 
              an active orogenic belt.  Comparison of crustal columns of the un-  deformed
              Chaco with the over-thickened Altiplano and Cordilleras  will be used to
              constrain the origin of the "anomalous" thickened  crust.  It is expected that
              this "seismic snapshot" of an active,  thick orogen will form the foundation on
              which to test ideas and  models of high-pressure regional metamorphism and
              anatexis in over-  thickened crust.  ***
