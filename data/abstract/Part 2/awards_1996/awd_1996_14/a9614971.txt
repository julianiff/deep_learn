Abstract    :
              9614971  Sacks    The PIs propose to study the effect of water on seismic 
              properties of mantle subduction zones by providing  experimental data needed to
              model this regime.  The proposed  research will involve experimental
              measurements of sound  velocities using their newly developed controlled-pulse-
               transmission technique on artificially hydrated, natural  mantle peridotite at
              high pressures and temperatures.  ***
