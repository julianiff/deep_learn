Abstract    :
                9614125 Ganz  This research project aims for greater atomic level
              understanding of thin film epitaxy of semiconductor materials.  New
              investigations utilizing an atom tracker are proposed for atomic resolution
              studies of diffusion at speeds 100 to 1000 times faster than previously
              possible with tunneling microscopy.  These studies will be incorporated into
              existing studies by the PI of nucleation and growth on silicon surfaces using
              tunneling microscopy at elevated temperatures. The atom tracker results will be
              linked to conventional high resolution room temperature STM images and high
              temperature STM movie studies to enhance and quantify understanding of
              diffusion and growth on the Si(001) surface. %%% The project is
              multidisciplinary combining materials physics with materials synthesis and
              processing studies including advanced characterization tools and analysis
              methods to address forefront research issues in a topical area of high
              technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science
              knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of processing and
              fabricating electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuitry. 
              Additionally, the knowledge and understanding gained from this research project
              is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of
              advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a
              basis for designing and producing improved materials, and materials
              combinations.  An important feature of the program is the integration of
              research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and
              technologically significant area. ***
