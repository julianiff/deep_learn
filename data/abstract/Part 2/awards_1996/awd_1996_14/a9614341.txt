Abstract    :
              van der Hilst  9614341    This research involves the study of the structure and
              dynamics of  the crust and mantle beneath Australia using high-resolution 3-D 
              models of seismic properties and surface observables such as heat  flow,
              gravity, and topography.  The main data set is derived from  project SKIPPY, a
              continent-wide deployment of broadband  seismometers in Australia that record
              earthquakes within and  surrounding the continent.  Spatial variations of
              seismic  parameters will be determined by tomographic imaging.  Azimuthal 
              anisotropy maps a t different depths will be constructed from  shear wave
              splitting and surface wave inversion.  Modeling  studies will be used to map
              3-D variations in temperature,  density, and viscosity in the Australian
              mantle.  The results  will be applicable to mineral economic and seismic hazard
               studies.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake  Hazard
              Reduction Program.  ***
