Abstract    :
              9614779  Nyblade    This research involves the study of the crust and upper
              mantle  structure in the Afar Triangle region of Ethiopia, a locus of a 
              postulated mantle plume.  Models of mantle plume structure will be  tested by
              examining the seismic velocity structure in the upper  mantle of the region. 
              The classic mantle plume model would predict  that upper mantle seismic
              velocities will be lower and the crust  will be thinner at the center of the
              plume where it intersects the  earth's surface.  Data will be used from two
              WWSSN stations in the  region, Addis Ababa and Dijbouti for earthquakes
              recorded between  1994 and 1997.  ***
