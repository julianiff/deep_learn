Abstract    :
                As medical prices and health care expenditures continue to rise, the
              government's role in the health insurance market is the subject of intensive
              debate.  The current tax-subsidy of employer-provided health insurance is under
              scrutiny, as it is thought to have encouraged increases in comprehensive
              insurance and the demand for medical care.  However, empirical studies
              investigating this issue have only employed data collected after major changes
              in the tax code were enacted in 1954.  As a result, the true effect of the
              tax-subsidy on the development of the health insurance market has yet to be
              examined.  This doctoral dissertation improvement award will permit the cost of
              placing in machine-readable form surveys conducted by the National Opinion
              Research Center in 1953 and 1958 which provide detailed micro-level data on
              medical expenses, health insurance coverage, income, savings, and employment
              for roughly 3,000 families drawn from an area-probability sample of the U.S.
              non-institutionalized population.  Since the 1953 data were collected before
              the major tax changes, it will be possible to directly test the effect of the
              1954 tax changes on the market for health insurance using a decomposition
              technique.  In addition, the data contains valuable information that will be
              used in future research examining the development of the health insurance
              market.
