Abstract    :
              9632919  Sayed         The proposal is  for an international workshop on
              "Numerical   Methods for Structured Matrices in Filtering and Control" to be  
              held in Santa Barbara CA, from August 1 to August 3, 1996.  The  conference is
              jointly organized by Stanford University and the  University of California,
              Santa Barbara (UCSB), in cooperation  with the Center for Control Engineering
              and Computation, UCSB.   The workshop is planned to comprise a series of
              invited  presentations by frontline researchers in the areas of filtering, 
              control, and numerical analysis.  One of the primary objectives  of the
              workshop is to bring together leading researchers in these  areas to discuss
              recent advances and future directions in the  design of fast and numerically
              reliable algorithms for structured  matrices arising in filtering and control
              applications.  ***
