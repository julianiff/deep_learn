Abstract    :
              This travel support grant will enable US scientists (20 participants in all) to
              attend three conferences, namely:  (1) the 1996 International Cloud Physics
              Conference in Zurich, Switzerland, (2) the Fourth International Cloud Modeling
              Workshop in Clermont-Ferrand, France, and (3) the 14th International Conference
              on Nucleation and Atmospheric Aerosols in Helsinki, Finland.  Papers presented
              at these conferences are generally bound and available as formal proceedings.
