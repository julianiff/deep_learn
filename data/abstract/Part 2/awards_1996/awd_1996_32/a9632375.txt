Abstract    :
                Consortium for Oceanographic Research and Education (CORE) will  conduct a
              workshop in December 1996 and a series of meetings on  the FUture of MArine
              GEoSciences (FUMAGES).  The workshop's main  objective is to initiate a
              dialogue within the marine geoscience  community and between the community and
              NSF to determine what  steps might be taken to maintain the health of Marine
              Geosciences.   The prospect of declining, or flat funding levels, as well as
              the  elimination, drastic cuts, and changes in other agencies' focus in  marine
              geoscience programs have major implications for the ocean  science community. 
              The task of workshop participants will be to  help identify the fundamental
              science questions in various  subdisciplines of marine geosciences to establish
              a sound  intellectual basis for future discussions and program development.
