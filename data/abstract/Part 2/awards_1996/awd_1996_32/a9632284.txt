Abstract    :
              The project adapts and extends an existing block-by-block main-memory garbage
              collection scheme, called Mature Object Space, for use in collecting persistent
              object stores. The scheme will locate and reclaim database memory containing no
              longer accessible data. This will relieve programmers of the burdensome and
              error-prone task of indicating which memory can be reused, thus allowing better
              programming styles. The algorithm is the first to work block by block
              (important for integrating nicely with databases) and to guarantee to find all
              inaccessible memory. It can also help reorganize (recluster) data and thus
              improve store performance. The algorithm is incremental, with a coarse
              granularity (collecting one block at a time).  A significant contribution of
              the research is the algorithm itself. Perhaps more significant will be the
              implementation and measurement of the algorithm, and investigation of how to
              incorporate reclustering.  The resulting storage management techniques will be
              suitable for incorporation into practical database management systems,
              guaranteeing that storage is not `lost` but eventually `found` and `recycled`
              for further use. The techniques will be substantially independent of storage
              management policy, allowing policy to be chosen by database implementors and
              application builders to best suit their needs.
