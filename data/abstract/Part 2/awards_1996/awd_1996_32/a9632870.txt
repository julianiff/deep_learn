Abstract    :
              In today's highly interconnected networks there is an increasing need to
              communicate among databases located at different sites and built using
              different data models.  The interoperability problem is made more difficult by
              the fact that in many data models there is often an unclear relationship
              between the actual representations and the abstract meanings of the databases.
              Hence it is unwieldy to interoperate directly among pairs of those models.   
              However, a clear relationship exists between representation and meaning in
              constraint databases, which are actually a set of data models parameterized by
              the types of constraints allowed in the language.  This project demonstrates
              how to express most of the practical temporal and spatial data models using
              constraint databases and how to solve in this context the interoperability
              problem.  Translations between different data models are expressed as queries
              in constraint query languages.  In addition, constraint query languages serve
              as a convenient intermediate layer for query translation between different
              query languages.    This project explores the theoretical foundations of
              constraint-based database interoperability and its practical applications.  It
              will facilitate data sharing and query reuse among different temporal and
              spatial database applications.
