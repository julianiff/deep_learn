Abstract    :
              This project will investigate inorganic thin films deposited on   chemically
              modified surfaces using pulsed laser vaporization.  The work   will be carried
              out under the direction of Dr. Eileen M. Spain at   Occidental College under
              this Research Planning Grant supported by the   Analytical and Surface
              Chemistry Program and the Office of Special   Projects in the Chemistry
              Division.  An organic layer will be placed on a   Au(111) surface by
              self-assembly of n-alkanethiols.  This will be   followed by depositing thin
              films of transition metal chalcogenides onto   the self-assembled monolayer
              (SAM) using pulsed laser vaporization in a   vacuum system which  will be
              locally constructed.  After transfer to   ambient conditions, the film
              morphology and structure will be imaged by   atomic force microscopy (AFM). 
              The long range goal of this research by   Dr. Spain and her undergraduate
              students is to understand the growth and   nucleation of inorganic thin films
              on chemically modified substrates.  Thin film technology involving layered
              structures is of the utmost   importance to the microelectronics, adhesive, and
              lubricant industries.    The properties of the interface between these film
              layers are critical to   performance.  The focus of this work is to develop an
              understanding of   the interface between an inorganic film deposited on top of
              an organic   film anchored to a metal.  Results from these studies will advance
              our   understanding of the structure of these interfaces and could lead to the 
               manufacture of new layered materials.
