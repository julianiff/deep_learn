Abstract    :
                This   project  will  enhance  the  stability,  reliability   and  efficiency
              of Prof. Werner Braun and coworkers' new computational  tool,  the
              self-correcting distance geometry (SECODG) method  for  NMR structure
              determination and protein design. Three-dimensional  structures  of proteins,
              RNA or DNA are calculated by the  SECODG  method  from  distance  and  dihedral
              angle  constraints.  Unlike  previous  distance  geometric methods, which  were
               designed  for  consistent  data  sets, the SECODG method can  generate 
              accurate  structures even from sets of constraints that contain errors. The 
              SECODG  method dramatically reduces the time to generate  protein  structures
              from NMR data. Dr. Braun's group will further  improve  this  method  and 
              explore  new  statistical  methods  for  error  detection.  The  SECODG method
              can also be used  to  predict  the  tertiary folds of proteins from the amino
              acid sequence,  if  the  secondary  structure  is partially or completely 
              known.  It  was  successfully  tested in a preliminary study for  its  ability 
              to  predict the fold of small helical proteins from their amino  acid 
              sequences,  and  it  will now be applied to a  broader  range  of  protein
              folds.    The  SECODG method will be a powerful computational tool to speed  up
                macromolecular  structure  determination  from   NMR   data.  Experimentally 
              determined three-dimensional  protein  structures  are  the  basis to design
              new drugs or proteins with improved  or  new  functions. In combination with
              energy minimization and Monte  Carlo  simulations it will help in designing
              proteins with  given  structural and new functional properties.
