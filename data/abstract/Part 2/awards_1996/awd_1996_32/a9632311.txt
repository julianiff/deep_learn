Abstract    :
              This award supports research by Dr. William C. Trogler and Dr. Mark H.  
              Thiemens, both of the Chemistry Department, University of California, San  
              Diego, for investigation of reactions leading to the production of   nitrous
              oxide in the environment.  The project is jointly funded by the   Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program, Chemistry   Division, and
              the Atmospheric Chemistry Program, Division of Atmospheric   Sciences.  The
              goal of the research is to help resolve the global nitrous   oxide budget and
              the variation observed in nitrous oxide emissions and   its isotopic
              composition.  The role of atmospheric carbon aerosol   surfaces as catalysts
              for nitrous oxide formation will be investigated,   as will mechanistic and
              electrochemical studies of fundamental chemical   reactions that form nitrous
              oxide.  In all the experiments, nitrogen and   oxygen heavy atom isotope
              effects will be determined as a possible   indictor of reaction mechanism and
              for comparison to existing isotopic   data for atmospheric nitrous oxide. 
              Nitrous oxide is a source of stratospheric nitric oxide, an important   sink
              for ozone, and it can also contribute to greenhouse warming because   of its
              high warming potential.   As a byproduct of industrial development   with a
              long lifetime in the atmosphere, it is important to understand its   sources
              but they are not completely known.  In this research, some   potential sources
              for nitrous oxide will be examined.
