Abstract    :
              This starter grant award to Princeton University supports the research of  
              Professor Sonny C. Lee.  The research focuses on an improved   understanding of
              the structural chemistry of the iron-molybdenum cofactor   in nitrogenase
              enzymes through investigation of metal-sulfur cluster core   rearrangements. 
              Certain reactions are known to transform common   iron-sulfur geometries into
              clusters bearing structural affinities to the   cofactor.  This chemistry is
              applied to new clusters classes to construct   higher nuclearity clusters with
              structural features similar to the   iron-molybdenum cofactor.  Clusters which
              are geometric isomers of the   cofactor are specific targets, with the goal of
              attaining clusters with   substantial topological homology to the cofactor.   
              The research advances understanding of the fundamental structural   chemistry
              of iron-sulfur clusters, leading to progress toward a chemical   understanding
              of nitrogenase.  The nitrogenase enzymes catalyze the   reduction of
              atmospheric dinitrogen to ammonia, a reaction critical to   the biological
              availability of fixed nitrogen.
