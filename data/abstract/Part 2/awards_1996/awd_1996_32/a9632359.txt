              Abstract  ATM-9632359  Lowenstein, Tim K.  State University of New York -
              Binghamton  Title: Collaborative Research: Geochemical Proxies from a Holocene 
              Pleistocene Salt Core, Salar Del Hombre Muerto, Argentina    This award
              supports a paleoenvironmental study of a 50+meter salt  core from Hombre Muerto
              salar, a dry lake in the southeastern  Altiplano of the Central Andes.  The
              core is a register of the  history of fill and desiccation of the lake, and is
              thus a record  of the changes in hydrology and climate extending back through 
              time.  In South America, the climate history of the Last Glacial  Maximum and
              the Holocene is controversial, and prior to the  Quaternary, it is virtually
              unknown.  Paleoclimate data extracted  from this core will address the relative
              timing of northern and  southern hemisphere climate cycles, and the temporal
              phase  relations between precipitation cycles and temperature cycles in  the
              Andes.
