Abstract    :
              This award is to support the Allerton Conference/Institute  on the uses of
              digital libraries. The study of how the new  resources, tools and services that
              fall under the rubric of  digital libraries are in fact being used is critical
              to help  assure that digital libraries are suitable for the tasks  they are
              meant to support.  The objectives for this  conference are to increase
              understanding of digital library  needs and uses, to improve participants
              skills in the  conduct of formative and summative digital library  evaluations,
              to share results of digital library use and  usability studies, and to provide
              an opportunity for digital  library researchers to meet and lay the foundations
              for  future interactions. These objectives will be met by  convening an
              interdisciplinary group of experts in  information system design and evaluation
              with others  currently involved in a wide range of digital library  projects. A
              specific aim is to connect the current Digital  Library Initiative projects
              with similar work conducted  around the world. The participants will present
              and discuss  results of their digital library use studies, hold small  group
              working sessions, and demonstrate new user interfaces  and online data
              collection techniques, and conduct  roundtable discussions of key research
              issues.
