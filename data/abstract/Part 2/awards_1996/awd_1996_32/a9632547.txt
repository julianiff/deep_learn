Abstract    :
              9632547  Thurber         This project involves short-term earthquake prediction
              on the  San Andreas Fault (SAF) in California.  In central California there  is
              a section of the fault which creeps, i.e. the fault moves  aseismically.  In
              this region, there appears to be a strong  apparent temporal relationship
              between creep events and  earthquakes.  For example, since April 1995, there
              have been six  earthquakes of magnitude between 3.4 and 5.0 which were preceded
              by  creep events.    This situation presents a unique opportunity to carry out
              an  earthquake prediction experiment along the creeping section of the  SAF. 
              The principal investigator has demonstrated the potential for  success in using
              creep data to predict the occurrence of an  earthquake.  This award will enable
              him to continue the effort to  predict additional moderate earthquakes in this
              area and to service  several string motion seismic instruments at regular
              intervals for  several more months, including initial data processing and
              quality  control.  ***
