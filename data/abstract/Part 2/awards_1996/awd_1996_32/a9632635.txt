Abstract    :
              963265  McMillan  The Material Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) 
              at Arizona State University supports research on the  synthesis of new families
              of materials, with a focus on the  synthesis of materials at high pressures. 
              The research  combines experimental and theoretical studies to predict the 
              stability, properties, and appropriate pressure range for  the synthesis of
              novel target phases of nitride glasses,  oxide perovskites, carbon nitrides,
              and chalcogenides.  Additional research efforts address the process of 
              vitrification in amorphous materials and the synthesis and  characterization of
              epitaxial nitride films.  The MRSEC  supports shared experimental facilities
              for materials  research, exploratory research through seed funding, and 
              collaborations with industry and other academic  institutions.  Educational
              outreach programs include  development of educational modules on materials
              science for  middle school students and a collaborative research program  with
              the College of Eastern Utah.  The Center supports 13  senior investigators, 4
              postdoctoral research associates, 12  graduate students, 1 technician, and 5
              undergraduates.  The  MRSEC is directed by Prof. Paul McMillan.  %%%  The
