Abstract    :
              9632364  Gordon      This grant provides $91,581 as one-half support of the
              costs of  acquiring hardware and software to upgrade Rice University's 
              Department of Geology and Geophysics computer system used for  geophysical
              research including global plate motion modeling,  processing and analyzing
              seismic reflection and refraction data and  analyses of paleomagnetic data. 
              Specific equipment will include 4  high-end Ultrasparc1 workstations with
              expanded memory and disk  storage, 4 lower end Sparc5 workstations, 1 Macintosh
              Power PC  computer for graphics, Western Omega's 3-D seismic processing 
              software and additional peripherals.  This system will allow  continued
              development of the NUVEL-1 global plate motion model  which requires extensive
              analyses and inversion of marine  geophysical and seismological data together
              with analyses of very-  long baseline interferometery (VLBI)data.  The
              continued  development and refinement of this model will be os significant 
              worldwide interest to the geoscientific community with interests in  active
              tectonic processes.  Additional research that will; be  conducted using this
              distributed network of computers will include  seismic investigation of the
              structure and tectonics of plate  margins and mountain belts including the San
              Andreas system, the  Basin and Range Province, the Mendocino Triple Junction
              and the  Brooks Range of Alaska and geodynamic modeling of the rifting of 
              continental lithosphere.  ***
