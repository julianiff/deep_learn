Abstract    :
              ***  9632508  Preuss  This project focuses on reconstruction following the
              January  17, 1995 earthquake that struck Kobe, Japan.  The magnitude  of this
              disaster was such that the reconstruction process is  extremely complex, and
              there are many lessons to be learned  in almost every aspect of earthquake
              response, recovery and  reconstruction.  The study will give primary attention
              to  physical reconstruction from a multi-disciplinary  perspective (urban
              planning, architecture and urban design,  and engineering) and will compare and
              contrast the Kobe  reconstruction experience with recent experience and 
              practice in the United States.  Three basic levels of  reconstruction will be
              investigated: (1) replacement of  individual buildings on the same site, (2)
              replacement of  groups of buildings on the same site within the existing 
              general street pattern (residential tracts), and (3)  replanning and
              replacement of neighborhoods involving  changes in street alignment and
              creation of different  spatial layouts (new town complexes).***
