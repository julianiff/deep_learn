Abstract    :
              9632273  The Far West Lab for Education Research and Development, a non-profit
              organization located in California, will complete and pilot an assessment
              instrument that is appropriate for use in standards-based instruction in
              science.  The project will involve a minimum of 5 educational systemic
              initiatives (SI) in 7 states.    The project will accomplish 5 tasks:    1. 
              Identify and convene teams of teachers to develop appropriate items for 
              standards-based science assessment instruments for Grades 5, 8, and 10.  The
              items will include enhanced, open-ended, and justified multiple-choice items,
              and performance tasks; they will be evaluated for cultural and gender bias, and
              offered in English and Spanish.  2.  Pilot-test, field-test, and administer the
              instrument.  3.  Score and report the results of the assessment on SI and
              non-SI students.  Data will be disaggregated by ethnicity, gender, and
              socioeconomic status.  Reporting will include comparisons such as:  SI vs.
              non-SI; intra-program (USI vs. USI); and cross-program (USI vs. SSI).  4. 
              Guide professional development for the teachers who will be administering the
              assessment instrument.  5.  Disseminate the items to other SIs in other states,
              cities, and regions.  ***
