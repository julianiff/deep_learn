Abstract    :
              9632604 abstract  Linda Jaslow    The Maricopa Community College District (MCCD)
              representing the Phoenix Urban   Systemic Initiative (USI), has a three-year,
              $902,514 professional development   program designed to enhance the USI primary
              training process to broaden   teachersO capacity to understand studentsO
              thinking and increase access for all   students so that they have a meaningful
              and relevant experience with primary   mathematics through the integration of
              Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI).   The project will provide specific CGI
              enhancement for 776 teachers and instructional leaders.  In addition, all 1476
              teachers of elementary mathematics will receive mathematics enhancement that
              has a CGI component.  This program consists of eight components that will
              ultimately impact student success in primary grades not only in Phoenix but in
              Tucson and Flagstaff.  They include the:   (1) development of a CGI leadership
              cadre who are knowledgeable about CGI and its classroom implementation,  (2)
              development of CGI courses and integration of CGI into the USI Academies,  (3)
              100% of the USI teachers trained in CGI to insure aligned curriculum and
              instruction for K-4 children in eight elementary school districts,  (4)
              implementation of CGI with University of Arizona and Tucson teachers and
              Northern Arizona University and Flagstaff teachers and the establishment of
              local networks,  (5) alignment of the K-12 system with the university
              pre-service program in Tucson, Phoenix and  Flagstaff,  (6) alignment of
              philosophy and content for the mathematics methods courses across the state
              universities,  (7) alignment of mathematics methods courses and Mathematics for
              Elementary Teachers (MTE 180) from the Mathematics Department at ASU,  (8)
              networking with San Diego State University and University of California-Los
              Angeles CGI projects.
