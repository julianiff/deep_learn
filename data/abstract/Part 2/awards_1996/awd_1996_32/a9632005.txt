Abstract    :
                      9632005  Williamson  Dr. Williamson and Dr. Ullman have recently
              discovered a gene, Meu1, that confers resistance to the potato aphid,
              Macrosiphum euphorbiae, in tomato.  Meul is tighly linked to Mi, a single,
              dominant locus that mediates resistance to root-knot nematodes.  The
              Mi-mediated resistance response to nematodes has been well characterized and
              shown to be associated with a rapid, hypersensitive response localized at the
              feeding site.  The means by which Meu1 mediates resistance to the aphid is
              unknown, though preliminary data indicate that Meu1-mediated resistance
              profoundly alters aphid development and affects feeding behavior.  It is
              hypothesized that the Meu1 gene product recognizes the aphid and triggers an
              active defense response.  Preliminary data are consistent with a rapidly
              induced hypersensitive similar to that widely described for plant pathogens and
              for Mi-mediated resistance to nemotodes.  The possiblity that a similar
              mechanism exists for insect resistance has been suggested, but not documented
              experimentally.  The major goal of this research is to characterize Meu1 and
              elucidate the mechanism of Meu1-mediated resistance.  If the hypotheses
              regarding Meu1-mediated resistance are correct, the research will elucidate a
              rarely reported mechanism of insect resistance in plants.
