Abstract    :
              Demott/Abstract            The objective of this research are to determine how
              the chemical  composition of atmospheric aerosols influences the formation of
              cirrus  clouds.  The Hypotheses to be tested are that ice formation by 
              homogeneous freezing nucleation occurs in agreement with theory for  solution
              droplets existing below 100% relative humidity at temperatures  below -35
              degrees Celsius, and that the insoluble components of partially-  soluble
              atmospheric aerosols readily serve as heterogeneous freezing  nuclei under less
              stringent conditions.  Systematic laboratory  measurements to temperatures as
              cold as -60 degrees Celsius will be made  using a continuous flow diffusion
              chamber to determine the onset solute   concentration conditions for
              homogeneous freezing nucleation in  solution droplets formed on sulfate
              aerosols of atmospheric relevance.   Measurements will be repeated for aerosols
              including well-characterized  insoluble aerosol components.  Validation
              measurements for distributions  of soluble and partially-soluble aerosols will
              be made in a cloud chamber   which simulates adiabatic air parcel ascent.  The
              laboratory data will be  used together with existing data on upper tropospheric
              aerosol and ice  nuclei composition to numerically investigate ice formation in
              cirrus  clouds.  The results are expected to be relevant to the role of
              aerosols in  influencing the radiative properties of upper tropospheric clouds
              through  controls on cloud microphysical composition.
