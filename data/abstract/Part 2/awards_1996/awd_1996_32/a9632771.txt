Abstract    :
              In this grant supported under the GOALI initiative in the Experimental  
              Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry division, A. Welford   Castleman at
              Pennsylvania State University, in conjunction with David   Thorn of DuPont
              Central Research and Development, will study the   structure and kinetics of
              clusters of transition metal oxides (Ti, Zr,   Nb) in fast flow reactors using
              tandem mass spectrometers.  The   effectiveness of these compounds as catalysts
              will be determined by   examining their effect on several novel gas-phase
              reactions, such as the   transfer of oxygen atoms to acetone to form methyl
              acetate.    A catalyst is a material which modifies a chemical reaction, such
              as   increasing its rate or causing different end products to be produced,  
              while leaving the material itself chemically unaltered at the end.  The  
              impetus behind this joint academic-industrial research project is to  
              determine the potential of various transition metal oxide compounds as  
              selective catalysts for chemical reactions involving the C-C and C-H   bonds in
              various hydrocarbon compounds.  DuPont scientists with   experience in solid
              state chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis will be   able to synthesize
              materials which were identified in Pennsylvania   State's gas-phase experiments
              as being particularly active in catalyzing   these reactions.
