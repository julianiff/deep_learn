Abstract    :
              9632287  Dunbar    This project will analyze oxygen and carbon stable isotopes
              and  trace elements (U, Ba) in corals from the Kenyan coast over the  last few
              centuries.  The data will provide a long-term continous  record of decade- to
              century-scale variability in SST and river  runoff (=rainfall) for a
              poorly-known tropical region, and will  contribute to understanding linkages
              between regional monsoon  variations and larger-scale features such as ENSO.
