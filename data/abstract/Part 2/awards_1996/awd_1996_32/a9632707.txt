Abstract    :
              9632707  Sands  A 12 month comprehensive investigation of
              microstructures-processing-property-performance relationship in integrated
              ferroelectric (Pb,La)(Zr,Ti)O3 capacitors is undertaken.  A capacitor layer
              structure with metallic ruthenate (SrRuO3-RuO2-Ru) electrodes and a conductive
              TiN diffusion barrier on poly-Si/Si and low-stress Si-N (LSN)/Si substrates
              will be studied in the context of applications to Gbit-scale nonvolatile memory
              and piezoelectric membranes for sensors and actuators in MicroElectroMechanical
              Systems (MEMS).    The objectives of the proposed research include: i)
              development of a model of microstructure-processing-property relationships
              based on observed constitutive relationship between processing variables,
              microstructural characteristics, and the resultant properties (e.g., remnant
              polarization, coercive field, breakdown field, piezoelectric coefficients,
              dielectric permittivity and loss tangent); ii) determination of failure
              mechanisms and conditions, including the factors that affect the electrical
              continuity from the substrate to the bottom electrode; iii) direct in situ
              observation of non-180o domain wall motion and ferroelastic behavior in the
              transmission electron microscope, and the relationship between the in situ
              observations and ex situ studies of electrical poling behavior at elevated
              temperature.  ***
