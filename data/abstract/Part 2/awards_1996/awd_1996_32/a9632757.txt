Abstract    :
              9632757   Prinn   This project supports the secretariat of the International
              Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Core Project of the International
              Geosphere-Biosphere Program. IGAC provides services to the
              atmospheric-biospheric chemistry research community through: (1) assistance in
              the coordination of international atmospheric/biospheric chemistry research
              projects, (2) publication of a quarterly newsletter and other documents that
              summarize IGAC scientific results, their relevance to society, and future
              plans, (3) aiding the IGAC Scientific Steering Committee and activity conveners
              in the planning and execution of their tasks, and (4) serving as the central
              information and communications center for the IGAC Project. In addition, a
              "mid-life" scientific and organizational review and evaluation of IGAC is
              planned.  ***
