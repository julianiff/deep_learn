Abstract    :
              9632657  Kelly  This proposal is on research to examine both basic and  applied
              issues of enzymes from two model  hyperthermophiles, the archaeon Pyrococcus
              furiosus  (Tmax 105 C) and the bacterium Thermotoga maritima  (Tmax 90 C). 
              This will be done using sequence  information on the entire genomes of both
              organisms  which will be available during the course of the  project.  Also,
              the diversity of hyperthermophiles in  both deep sea and continental geothermal
              sites will be  examined, and the types of enzymes they contain will be  studied
              for their physiological significance,  thermmostability/thermoactivity and/or
              biotechnological  potential.  Emphasis will be placed on hydrolytic and  redox
              enzymes involved in the metabolism of  carbohydrates and peptides. 
              Characterization of the  diversity and biochemical features of this enzyme
              group  will be investigated by both recombinant and  biochemical techniques to
              change patterns of substrate  specificity.  Mechanisms of thermostabilization
              and  chemical stabilization of hyperthermophilic enzymes  will also be
              addressed.  Also, the use of both existing  and new enzymes will be evaluated
              in a variety of  biotechnological applications in conjunction with an 
              industrial collaboration.  ***
