Abstract    :
              ***  9632779  Tierney  This two-year project addresses three related questions:
              (1)  What longer-term consequences do disasters have for  individual
              businesses?, (2) What factors are associated with  differential disaster
              outcomes for businesses?, and (3) What  consequences does heavy and
              concentrated damage to business  and commercial districts have for business
              activity in those  high-damaged areas?  The project will focus on two 
              geographic areas that suffered severe damage and disruption  in two major
              disasters: Santa Cruz County, California and  its communities of Santa Cruz and
              Watsonville, which were  heavily damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake;
              and  Southern Dade County, Florida and its communities of  Homestead and
              Florida City, which sustained major damage in  Hurricane Andrew in 1992.  Two
              main tasks will be  undertaken: (1) conducting mail surveys on representative, 
              random samples of businesses in each area: and (2)  collecting interview data,
              social indicator data, and  archival material documenting what disaster-related
              changes,  if any, have taken place in heavily damaged business  districts.***
