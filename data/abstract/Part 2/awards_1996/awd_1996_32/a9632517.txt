Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry
              Program, focusses on the interaction of low energy  polyatomic ions with
              adsorbate covered metal surfaces.  During  the tenure of this thirty-three
              month grant, Professor Luke  Hanley and his students at the University of
              Illinois at Chicago  will seek to develop an understanding of the surface
              induced  dissociation of polyatomic ions for application in analytical  mass
              spectrometry, and to investigate the deposition of energy  into multilayers of
              adsorbates.  A tandem quradrupole mass  spectrometer with an ultra-high vacuum
              scattering chamber,  developed recently by Professor Hanley under NSF grant
              CHE-  9220393, will be used in these studies.  This research combines
              experimental and computational methods to  study the interaction of low energy
              polyatomic ions with  adsorbate covered metal surfaces.  A detailed
              understanding of  polyatomic ion-surface collisions is important to the
              development  of surface induced dissociation (SID) as a sample introduction 
              technique in bioanalytical mass spectrometry.  Such an  understanding is also
              important to the development of surface  modification methodologies that are
              widely used in materials  processing.
