Abstract    :
              9632665  Draayer    LaSER, Louisiana's EPSCoR Committee, will build a compressed
               audio/video (A/V) communication network to enhance the state's   research
              competitiveness. The proposed network will interconnect  eight institutions of
              higher education and the Board of Regents.  Specifically, LaSER will establish
              A/V centers at institutions  which provide leadership for its EPSCoR research
              clusters and  centers.  The A/V centers will allow researchers to overcome the 
              geographical separation that acts as a fundamental barrier to 
              inter-institutional research collaborations by giving EPSCoR  researchers tools
              for participating in inter-institutional  sharing/strategy sessions; and (2)
              serve as a prototype for an  expanded next-generation, statewide research
              network.
