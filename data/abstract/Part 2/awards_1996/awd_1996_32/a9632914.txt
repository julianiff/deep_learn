Abstract    :
              9632914  Carpenter    This project will provide support for 20 US secondary
              Earth Science teachers and 10 post-secondary Earth Scientists and Earth Science
              Educators to attend the Second International Conference on Geoscience
              Education, which will be held in Hilo, HI July 28 through August 1, 1997.  The
              focus of the conference is to emphasize and demonstrate the Earth Systems
              approach to the teaching of Earth Science.  Participants will be selected on
              the basis of their experience as leaders in Earth Science education and upon
              the nature of the program they will be offering at the conference.  80% of
              those selected must not have participated in more than two nationally supported
              institutes.  Dissemination activities include the Conference Proceedings and 
              presentations by the participants at professional meetings.      Matching funds
              constitute 35% of the NSF award.
