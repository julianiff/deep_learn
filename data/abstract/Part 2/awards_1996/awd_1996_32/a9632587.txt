Abstract    :
              **   9632587   Erten    This STTR Phase I project will investigate the
              feasibility of a novel architecture integrating light sensing and image
              processing functions on the same chip.  Specific image patterns can be learned
              by the proposed circuits within microseconds.  This information is stored in
              the synaptic connections on-chip and can be recalled at later processing steps
              - even from incomplete or noisy data.   The proposed system will be a
              co-processor by design.  The intent is to assure not only compatibility but
              also high performance within a conventional computer architecture framework. 
              Commercially-available microprocessors and digital signal processors can thus
              be used to add on symbolic data manipulation capability for comprehensive
              systems. The work involves investigation of a locally connected neural
              architecture pioneered at the research institution and experimentation with
              prototype chips with on-chip CMOS light sensing diodes.  This broad scope of
              investigations will allow for a better understanding of the issues involved
              towards a successful Phase II prototype.    ***
