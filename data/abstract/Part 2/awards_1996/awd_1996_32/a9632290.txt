Abstract    :
              ***   9632290   Tuenge      This Phase I STTR project will investigate
              metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) to improve the performance of
              the blue-emitting layer used for full-color thin film electroluminescent (TFEL)
              displays. TFEL displays have demonstrated performance advantages compared with
              active matrix liquid crystal displays (AMLCD's) including wide viewing angle,
              wide operating temperature range, fast response time and inherent ruggedness.
              Commercialization of TFEL displays has been impeded by the insufficient
              luminance and efficiency of the blue-emitting EL phosphor films. MOCVD has
              demonstrated the capability of growing crystalline binary and ternary sulfide
              phosphors at temperatures less than 600 C, eliminating the need for costly high
              temperature substrates. Two approaches will be pursued for improving the blue
              EL material performance. The MOCVD process for he SrS:Ce phosphor will be
              optimized for luminance and emission intensity in the blue spectral region. The
              addition of codopants including Mn and Zn will be investigated to compensate
              for SrS lattice defects. Secondly, MOCVD of cerium doped cubic- GaS will be
              investigated as a potential new blue EL phosphor. The best performing
              blue-emitting material will be selected for process scale to commercial size
              TFEL display panels in Phase II.   Potential commercial applications include
              full-color emissive flat panel displays for use in portable computers,
              industrial process control, instrument and medical electronics and
              telecommunications.    ***
