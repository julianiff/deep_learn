Abstract    :
              The Science Museum of Minnesota (SMM) will develop a comprehensive  after-school
              program that be an extension of its "RiverGirls" four-  week ecology-based
              summer camp.  The ASSETS Project will enable 24  to 48 of the girls who
              participated in the RiverGirls Camp to  engage in two, twelve-week after school
              program sequences that will  provide them with in-depth science contact,
              multiple experiences  with technology and tools, and opportunities to develop
              more  positive relationships with peers and role models who reflect their  own
              cultural identities.  A special focus of the project includes  incorporating
              participants' parents in an active and fundamental  way in their daughters;
              educational experience at the museum.  This  involvement is designed to help
              parents provide increased support  to their daughters' in science and math
              education.    The girls who complete the ASSETS Project will be recruited into 
              other science and math enrichment programs for youth at the museum.   Overall
              project and program design will be based on recent  resiliency research that
              has shown youth from any background who  grow up with a key combination of
              assets, including personal  qualities, a supportive environment, and acquired
              skills, will have  a better chance to make the transition to successful and
              productive  adulthood.
