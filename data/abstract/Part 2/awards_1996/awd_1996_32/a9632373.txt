Abstract    :
              This award provides support for International Press Lecture  Series II:
              Invariant Theory and Combinatorics of Representations,  which will be held at
              the University of California at Irvine in  January 1997. The conference will
              emphasize the   interdisciplinary nature of representation theory. Roger Howe 
              will give the three main one-hour lectures. Other participants in  the
              conference will come from the disciplines of geometric  invariant theory,
              combinatorics, representation theory, and group  theory. There will be ten
              supplementary lectures from  mathematicians in these disciplines.  The subject
              matter of this  conference is connected to several different areas of 
              mathematics, including invariant theory and combinatorics. In  general,
              invariant theory involves the  actions of linear  algebraic groups on manifolds
              or linear spaces and the   determination of  the mathematical invariants of the
              space under  these group actions.  Combinatorics attempts to find efficient 
              methods to study how discrete collections of  objects can be  arranged. The
              behavior of discrete systems is extremely important  to  modern communications.
