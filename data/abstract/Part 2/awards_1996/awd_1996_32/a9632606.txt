Abstract    :
              9632606  Gallager  Theoretical studies have shown that turbulence, prey
              motility,  depth, and light intensity are critical to the foraging success and 
              recruitment of larval fishes. This project will conduct an  intensive program
              of field and laboratory research to investigate  the effect of these variables
              on cod larvae. The results will be  useful for modeling interrelationships
              between bio-physical  coupling, trophodynamic interactions, and climate change.
              This  project is a part of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field  Studies,
              Phase 2 program.  ***
