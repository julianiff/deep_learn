Abstract    :
              CTS - 9632079  Peter Pintauro  Tulane University      ABSTRACT       The project
              involves the fabrication of crosslinked and sulfonated cation-exchange
              membranes from alkylphenoxy-  and  alkylphenoxy/phenoxy-substituted
              polyphospazenes.  Phosphazene polymers are promising base-materials for new
              membranes due to their chemical and thermal stability and the ease of modifying
              the polymer by adding different side-chains onto the -P=N- Backbone.  The
              chemical and mechanical properties of the resulting membranes will be
              characterized.  The membranes will differ in chemical composition, ion-exchange
              capacity, and degree of crosslinking.  Potential applications of the membranes
              include electrodialysis and ultrafiltration, as well as solid polymer
              electrolyte fuel cells.
