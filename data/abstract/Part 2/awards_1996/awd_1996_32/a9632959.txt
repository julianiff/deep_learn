Abstract    :
              9632959  Luty                                       This project studies the
              electronic and vibrational excitation, energy-  migration,  and relaxation
              processes, involving various molecular  and  electronic  defects in ordered and
              disordered ionic  solids.  Research  will  include electron-vibration energy
              transfer processes between  F-  centers  and  molecular defects will be
              investigated  using  resonance  Raman scattering, vibrational luminescence and
              Fourier transform infra-  red  spectroscopy. A newly developed technique will
              be used to produce  high-quality  ultra-thin  crystals in  the  range  0.2 
              -100  mm.  The  influence  of  the mesoscopic size on the films on the
              energy-transfer  and  phase behavior of the materials will be investigated and
              may lead  to new optical materials or research possibilities.  %%%  This
              project involves the study of the optical properties of materials  which  are 
              typically used in laser devices. One area of  interest  is  that  of energy
              transfer processes that need to be understand in order  to  optimize  the 
              optical  and lasing properties  of  the  materials.  Another  important  area
              is that of thin films of  optical  materials,  where  the  reduced size of the
              medium changes the  properties  of  in  crystals  in new and incompletely
              understood ways. The study of  these  materials may lead to new laser materials
              or devise applications.  ***
