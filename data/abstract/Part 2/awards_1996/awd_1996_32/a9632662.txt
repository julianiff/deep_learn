Abstract    :
              This research explores visualization methods for examining  high-dimensional
              data with low-dimensional projections with CAVE  Virtual Reality technology.
              Dynamic graphical methods for  exploratory  data analysis are examined in a 3-d
              immersible environment. The  methods are based on generating motion graphics
              from continuous  sequences of 3-d projections of high-dimensional data. 
              Interactive  user control is considered in the form of controlling the path of 
              the  3-d sequences in the data space.     Virtual Reality offers the
              construction and realization of an  artificial 3-dimensional world that has
              important potential use  in  scientific areas. Statistics is the science of
              making sense of  complicated data. For example, typical environmental data sets
               may  contain thousands of data values on hundreds of variables.  Graphical 
              methods are needed for exploring and determining relationships  among 
              variables such as tree crown health, topography, temperature,  population
              density and atmospheric pollutants. This research  explores  statistical
              graphical methods for visualizing many variables  simultaneously using CAVE
              Virtual Reality technology. The  research  relates to the Federal Strategic
              Area of Improved Environmental  Quality in that the examined methods can
              provide insights for  examining spatially measured environmental data. It also
              relates  to  the Federal Strategic Area of Harnessing Information Technology 
              because it examines using Virtual Reality technology for  organizing  and
              synthesizing information.
