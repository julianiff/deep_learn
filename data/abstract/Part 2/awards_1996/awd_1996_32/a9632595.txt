Abstract    :
              Many large corporations find themselves with a massive legacy database problem. 
              Their data is distributed across many semantically related databases that are
              physically and logically disjoint.  Until now, there have been two primary
              approaches for interconnecting heterogeneous database systems: (a) point
              solutions, in which software systems supporting focused interconnections
              between databases are constructed on an as-needed and ad hoc basis; and (b)
              global solutions, in which a common, logical database is created that
              encompasses a very large number of databases.  (A variation of the latter is
              the federated approach, which involves a global federation manager that
              controls all interaction between the component databases.)  The Diplomat
              project chooses a middle ground between these two extremes, and provides
              technology to support multiple loose database interconnections called
              `alliances`.  The framework also provides mechanisms to enforce consistency
              between individual databases, and across alliances. The project draws on
              existing research on view specification, inter-database constraints, and
              information flow.  This research serves as a proof of concept that maintainers
              of large business applications (such as banking, insurance, and
              telecommunications) can integrate multiple, heterogeneous, legacy database
              systems in a cost-effective, evolvable fashion.
