Abstract    :
              9632801  Koditschek  This proposal describes an approach to the control of
              xerographic  printing that, if successful, promises to advance the state of the
               art in the industry, help lead Xerox Corporation into a $80B new  market, and
              considerably enlarge the academic community's  experience with application of
              robust, nonlinear, and intelligent  controls techniques in competitive, fast
              moving consumer markets.   The chief technical objective is a dramatic
              improvement in the  process stability of dry powder color xerography.  The long
              term  goal is to demonstrate this level of stability in all relevant 
              environmental zones (temperature, relative humidity), a variety of  paper types
              and colors, and over a number of machines.  A second  contribution will be the
              development of a new controls oriented  design support methodology.  The
              approach to this problem will be  driven by a "problem solving" focus (rather
              than a "theory driven  focus") to creatively combine the strengths of the
              researchers at  the Wilson Research Center with the academic researchers at the
               University of Michigan.  Preliminary discussions suggest a  hierarchical
              controller whose lower level specifies process  parameters using robust
              (nonadaptive) nonlinear controller  techniques with a higher level
              specification of the product  parameters using model driven adaptive or
              possibly learning  techniques. The control algorithms and architectures
              developed in  this project will be assessed for product-worthiness with respect
               to the standard Xerox Field Readiness Determination Testing  procedures.  ***
