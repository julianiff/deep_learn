Abstract    :
                9632252 Cahill  This research project aims for fundamental understanding of
              ion-induced surface damage using atomic resolution STM and molecular
              dynamics(MD) computer simulation methods.  The approach is to characterize a
              wide variety of materials and correlate the damage observed using the STM to MD
              simulations of the ion-surface collisions; the research is also oriented toward
              critically testing some of the assumptions commonly made in MD simulations. 
              Defect generation in solids is a complex many-body process which cannot be
              theoretically treated in the binary collision approximation.  Collective
              behaviors such as thermal spikes play a critical role in determining defect
              structures and are increasingly important for precision ion-beam processing
              applications such as shallow implant doping of semiconductors.  A variety of
              materials(Ge, Si, Au, Pt, Cu, Ni, GaAs, GaN and amorphous NiZr) will be grown
              by MBE and examined by STM for ion impacts using Ga, In, and Au in the energy
              range of 1 keV to 40 keV.  MD simulations will be performed for 5-15 keV
              impacts on Ge, Pt, and amorphous Cu to elucidate the mechanisms of surface
              damage. %%% The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a
              fundamental level of broad technological relevance to advanced electronic
              materials processing.  Additionally, the knowledge and understanding gained
              from this research project is expected to contribute in a general way to
              improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a
              fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and processing more
              advanced materials and devices.  An important feature of the program is the
              integration of research and education through the training of students in a
              fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***
