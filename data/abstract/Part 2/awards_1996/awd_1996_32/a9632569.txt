Abstract    :
              ***  9632569  Snodgrass  A wide range of database applications manage
              time-varying information.  Such applications typically use conventional
              relational systems, which include little support for temporal applications,
              other than date and time data types.  The research community has done a
              remarkable job of incorporating the many novel ideas of twenty years of
              research in the consensus temporal query language TSQL2. The SQL3 committee has
              started the process of transferring the facilities of TSQL2 into the standard
              by approving a new part, SQL/Temporal.  As a part of this GOALI project, TSQL2
              validation suite is being designed. Secondly, a functional prototype for the
              entire language is being developed; this prototype can be tested with the
              validation suite. A set of case studies comparing SQL and TSQL2 solutions
              utilizes the prototype to provide an evaluation of the practical utility of the
              language constructs.      These artifacts will be made available to the
              standards bodies and to vendors interested in enabling via their products the
              development and productions gains made possible with temporal database
              technology, thereby ensuring a direct transfer of insights from the temporal
              database research community to industry.  ***
