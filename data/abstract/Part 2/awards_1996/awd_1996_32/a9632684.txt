Abstract    :
              9632684  Brannon    The listings of endangered species and the species recovery
              plans   proposed by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) administration  agencies
              are characterized by a lack of information on the genetics  and biology of the
              species.  These omissions have resulted in ESA  errors and higher public costs.
               To help make the ESA more  effective, and to increase coordination with state
              and federal  fishery agencies, a laboratory for ESA salmonid and freshwater 
              species research will be established to provide the genetic  information and
              concomitant conservation recommendations for  current and candidate endangered
              species.  Idaho is the ideal  laboratory site because the only remaining native
              fish of some ESA-  listed species (i.e. Snake River chinook salmon, Snake River
               sockeye salmon, and Kootenai River white sturgeon) are found in the  state.
