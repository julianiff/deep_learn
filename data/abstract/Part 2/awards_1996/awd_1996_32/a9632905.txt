Abstract    :
              9632905  Hackert  University of Texas Austin  This award from the Chemistry
              Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program and the Academic
              Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry &
              Biochemistry at the University of Texas Austin acquire a Mass Spectrometer.
              This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the
              following: (1)  photo induced electron transfer in unusual environments (2) 
              RNA structure and the structural basis of RNA-protein interactions (3) 
              molecular weight and structural information of pi-beams, large synthetic
              molcules with noncovalent higher order structures (4)  mass measurements of
              expanded porphyrins and synthetic carriers for antiviral agents with molecular
              weights of several thousand Da. (5)  hydrogen-bond-driven molecular recognition
              between small molecules, and (6)  nascent peptides.    Mass spectrometry (MS)
              is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the
              molecular compositions of a vast array of organic,bioorganic, and
              organometallic molecules. The addition of the technique of electrospray extends
              the range of MS to proteins and nucleic acid molecular weights far beyond any
              other technique. The use of electrospray ionization in combination with high
              resolution provides the latest techniques available in mass spectrometry. It
              affords the chemist one of the most powerful tools available for the
              characterization of compounds. The acquisition of this capability in mass
              spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier research in many
              fields of chemistry.
