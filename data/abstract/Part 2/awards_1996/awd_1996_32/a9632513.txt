Abstract    :
              The PI will make modifications to his field-proven instrumentation and
              participate in a summer campaign in 1996.  The spectrometer used in the 1995
              campaign will have improved sensitivity, allowing definitive measurements of
              ratios between the neutral N2 and the ionized N2+ bands.  This improved
              sensitivity will be facilitated by using a higher gain image intensifier
              system, which will "see" the night sky background.  The PI will continue using
              the spectrometer with vertical grating rulings to obtain spectrograms, which
              are spatially resolved in the vertical direction, providing height resolved
              spectra.  The spectrometer will also be used in a special mode to obtain a
              coarse resolution spectra of other commonly observed optical emission
              phenomena; the elves.***
