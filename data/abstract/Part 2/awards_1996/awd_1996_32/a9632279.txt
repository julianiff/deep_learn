Abstract    :
                9632279 Wu  This research project addresses film growth mechanisms in fast
              temperature ramping Hg-vapor annealing(FTRA) of Hg-based cuprate(HgBaCaCuO)
              superconductor films.  The film growth mechanism in the FTRA process will be
              studied by correlating processing parameters to the sample physical properties
              including phase purity, film/substrate interface structure and surface
              morphology, Tc, Jc, and other superconducting characteristics.  Expectations
              are that the FTRA technique can minimize problems caused by the high volatility
              of the Hg-compounds involved, formation of CaHgO2, and chemical reactions at
              the film/substrate interface.  Chemical-doping-assisted growth of Hg-based
              cuprate films using Na, Tl, or Re as the dopant will also be investigated to
              achieve high-purity epitaxial Hg-1223 thin films. Rare-earth garnets and LaAlO3
              will be used as substrates in the fabrication of large-area Hg-based cuprate
              wafers. %%% The project is multidisciplinary combining fundamental materials
              chemistry/physics and materials processing studies with advanced
              characterization tools and analysis methods to address forefront issues in a
              topical area of high scientific value and potential technological benefits. 
              The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental
              level to several aspects of advanced microwave and microelectronic devices. 
              The knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is expected
              to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced devices
              by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and
              producing improved materials, and materials processing routes.  An important
              feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the
              training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.
