Abstract    :
              A three-year experimental and analytical research program is undertaken to study
              the design and behavior of steel moment-resisting frames with composites
              reinforced concrete (RC) infill walls subjected to seismic excitations.  The
              program includes a series of two two-story, one-bay frame experiments, cyclic
              shear connector experiments, and a comprehensive analytical effort.  In the
              steel frame-RC infill system, the steel beams and columns act as boundary
              members resisting gavotte loads and axial forces from seismic overturning,
              while the RC infills serve as webs resisting shear.  Simulated seismic load
              testing of one-third scale, two-story, one-bay frames will be conducted to
              determine the seismic behavior of steel frame-RC infill composite wall systems.
               The proportions of strength and stiffness provided to the system by the steel
              frame and the  RC infills will be determined.  Fully-restrained (moment)
              beam-to-column connections partially-restrained will be tested.  In addition,
              cyclic shear tests of connector specimens to quantify the strength of shear
              studs under cyclic shear and axial tension will also be tested.  Data analysis
              coupled with linear and nonlinear analysis of steel frame-RC infill
              subassemblages will serve to establish analysis and design recommendations. 
              Experimental observations from the frame tests, coupled with all existing
              experimental data on similar systems conducted to date which consist mainly of
              geometry, topology, and constitutive properties of simple computational models
              for the RC infills (e.g., effective compression struts or membrane elements).
