Abstract    :
              9632632 Pinsky  Abstract      This project supports the eighteenth annual
              Midwest Probability Colloquium, held at Northwestern University in Evanston,
              Illinois on October 18-19, 1996.  The Colloquium is an annual gathering, at
              Northwestern, of 75-100 experts in  probability theory from the Great Lakes
              region and other parts of the U.S. and Canada. The 1996 program features David
              Nualart of the University of Barcelona, Spain, as the main speaker, with
              Michael Cranston of the University of Rochester and Uwe Einmahl of Indiana
              University as other invited speakers. More than half of the NSF support is
              targeted toward stipends for young researchers, especially those traditionally
              underrepresented groups such as women and minorities.  Availability of awards
              is advertised in publications of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, the
              American Mathematical Society and appropriate web sites.
