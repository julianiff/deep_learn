Abstract    :
                This award to the University of Michigan supports the dissertation research of
              an anthropology graduate student in the Ukraine.  The student will study the
              production of national and local political identities in a border region near
              Romania.  Using methods of ethnography and of speech analysis and focusing on
              local language use, the student will test the hypothesis that national identity
              formation is impeded by local identities formed in contrastive interaction with
              nearby different local speech-dialect communities. Methods include ethnographic
              observation and formal linguistic analysis of biographic and topical
              conversations recorded in formal interviews and everyday conversations.  This
              research is important because it will advance our understanding of how
              localized identities are incompatible with the ideology of national unity that
              underlies language standardization.  Understanding how local identities
              contrast with national identities is of primary importance in this era of
              increasing `ethnic politics` and tendencies for local political fragmentation
              in multi-ethnic nation states.  In addition the project will add to the
              nation's capacity for scientific research in this important region of the
              world.
