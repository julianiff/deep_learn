Abstract    :
              VLSI chip testing tools, produced in research projects at the Virginia 
              Polytechnic University, are being developed and enhanced.  The tools are
              intended  to support teaching and research in academia.  These tools include, a
               combinational circuit automatic test pattern generator (ATPG), a sequential
              fault  simulator, a sequential ATPG for both synchronous and asynchronous
              sequential  circuits, and two parsers for analyzing circuit designs in the
              languages VHDL and  EDIF.  A benchmark collection of industrial type circuits
              is being developed.   The tools are being developed so that they: 1. are easy
              to install and use, and  are maintenance free; 2. provide a variety of options
              to support many research  and teaching activities; and 3. the source code is 
              easy to read, modify and  extend.  The tools and their source code are being
              distributed freely to  universities for research and teaching.
