Abstract    :
              9632122 Bormann    Effect of Windthrow Disturbance on Decomposition-Weathering
              Feedback and Watershed Nutrient Dynamics    The ecology of disturbance is
              increasingly considered an important foundation for new natural-resource
              management strategies to provide for human uses while seeking to maintain
              biodiversity and key ecosystem processes. A disturbance common to most forests
              is the uprooting of trees (windthrow). This research will explore whether
              mixing of organic and mineral soil horizons by windthrow is an process that
              influences long-term forest productivity.  The mixing of organic and mineral
              soils may speed the breakdown (weathering) of rock particles and may release
              nutrients (base elements, phosphorus, and micronutrients) for plant uptake.
              Extensive windthrow over large areas may also affect weathering in entire
              watersheds--as measured by the flux of bicarbonate, cations, and organic matter
              in stream water--by increasing water flow through mineral soils.  Changes in
              stream water chemistry may have indirect, but     significant, effects on the
              productivity of anadromous fish.  Productive, largely pristine, forests of
              Southeast Alaska provide the setting for this research.
