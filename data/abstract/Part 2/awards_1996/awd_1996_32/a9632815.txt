Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the use of SF5-containing epoxides and   acrylates
               as photopolymerizable synthons for the production of durable   polymer films
              and coatings.  The synthons, in small concentrations, will   partition to
              interfaces and create fluorine enriched overlayers.     Targeted epoxides and
              acrylates will be synthesized from SF5-iodides,   olefins, acylfluorides and
              alcohols.  The structure of the films will be   determined by X-ray
              photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and infrared   analysis, while film
              properties, including refractive index, dielectric   constant and surface
              energy will also be measured.  With this new award,   the Synthetic Organic
              Program is supporting the research of Dr. Gary L.   Gard of the Department of
              Chemistry at Portland State University.    Professor Gard will focus his work
              on using new and unique fluorinated   photopolymerizable synthons to form new
              durable polymer films and   coatings.  Fluorinated films and coatings possess
              high dielectric   strength, low refractive index and excellent environmental
              stability.
