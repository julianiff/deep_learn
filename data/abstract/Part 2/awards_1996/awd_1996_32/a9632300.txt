Abstract    :
              ***  9632300  Tavlykaev   This STTR Phase I project will develop a waveguide
              grating filter device with enhanced performance that can meet the needs of most
              complex WDM systems. This filter will then be coupled to an external laser
              source to form a hybrid optical module with tunable wavelength for a number of
              practical applications. This new technology, developed in conjunction with the
              University of Florida, will then be transferred to Advanced Photonics
              Technology Inc. for further refinement to a precommercial level.
              Wavelength-selective filters in the integrated-optic embodiment are the most
              promising candidates for deployment in Wavelength-Division-Multiplexed
              networks. A waveguide grating filter appears to be very promising on account of
              its extreme wavelength sensitivity and compactness. However, the performance of
              practical devices has thus far been severely limited by the lack of
              high-reflectance waveguide gratings. The unique feature of the proposed effort
              in achieving high-reflectance gratings is the use of a Silicon overlayer to
              substantially perturb the mode index of an optical waveguide underneath it 
              without adding an additional mode loss. Silicon has been selected on account of
              its large refractive index, processibility, and low cost.   The primary
              commercial application of waveguide grating filters is in
              Wavelength-Division-Multiplexed networks. Another most important application is
              the development of compact and efficient waveguide lasers and amplifiers.
