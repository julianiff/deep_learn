Abstract    :
              Masten  9632232    This is an award to support research on a recirculating
              treatment  system using ozone for improving the biodegradability of 
              disinfection byproducts and precursors from water containing  natural organic
              matter.  The project's research objectives are to  obtain an understanding of
              how organic materials in natural  waters are modified during the application of
              ozone and the  response of biological systems to products of this ozonation 
              process.  This knowledge will be utilized in  development of  mathematical
              models that can be used to predict removal of the  target substances from water
              by the use of the recirculating  system proposed for study in this project. 
              The parameters to be  monitored in evaluation of the system to be studied
              include total  organic carbon, ultraviolet absorbance, alkalinity, assimilable 
              organic carbon, trihalomethanes, haloacetic acid formation  potential, heavy
              metals, bromide ion and specific organic  compounds.    This project addresses
              a need for determining how to deal with  the presence of naturally occurring
              organic materials in water  that combine with chlorine when used as a
              disinfectant to produce  undesirable compounds of carcinogenic significance. 
              Results of  this project are expected to lead to mathematical models that can 
              be utilized in the engineering design of systems to address this  problem.  The
              research being conducted involves identification of  relationships between
              products of the ozonation process, the  biodegradability of those products and
              the potential for the  formation of trihalomethanes and other chlorinated
              compounds  during subsequent chlorination to disinfect the treated water.
