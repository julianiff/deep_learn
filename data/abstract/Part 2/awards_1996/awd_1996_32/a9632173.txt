Abstract    :
              9632173  Ge  This GOALI project develops a computer-aided methodology for 
              synthesis of low-harmonic trajectories that would reduce the  potential of
              vibration and related control problems of high-speed  machinery. In addition,it
              formulates a trajectory-pattern  methodology for optimal design of high-speed
              machinery.  Collaborative research work is performed with OmniTek Research  and
              Development, Inc. of Brooklyn, NY under the Faculty-In-  Industry aspect of the
              GOALI program. Polynominal and spline  curves have been widely used for
              planning motions of computer  controlled  machinery. The resulting
              trajectories, when expressed  in Fourier series, generally indicate a
              considerable number of  harmonics with high frequencies in the actuator
              coordinate  system. The presence of such high frequency harmonics in the 
              trajectory is a significant source of the internal induced  vibrations. It is
              the reduction of these vibration excitations in  high-speed machinery that is
              addressed in this research  project.***
