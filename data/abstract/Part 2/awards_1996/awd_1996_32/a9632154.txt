Abstract    :
              9632154  Boecklen  Over the past twenty years, the study of hybrid zones has
              grown from a backwater of systematics to one of the most dynamic areas in
              evolutionary biology and ecology.  Hybrid zones are centers of genetic
              diversity, and so represent ideal experimental systems in which to investigate
              evolutionary processes, including natural selection and interactions between
              hosts and parasites.  Despite the renewed interest in hybrid zones among
              ecologists, the influence of hybrid zones on plant-insect interactions is
              poorly understood.  The proposed research will examine hybrid zones of Madrean
              and Southwestern oaks, and will use a combination of biogeographic, molecular
              genetic, and field experimental approaches to investigate the effects of host
              plant hybridization on herbivore population dynamics and community structure. 
              In addition, the influence of plant hybridization on the outcome of
              antagonistic interactions between endophytic fungi and interactions between
              endophytes and herbivores will be tested using field inoculations of fungal
              species onto oak hosts.  The proposed research will contribute to our
              understanding of plant-herbivore interactions, and will help identify factors
              that influence plant susceptibility to herbivore attack.  By understanding how
              herbivores respond to genetically novel host plants (i.e, hybrids), results of
              this research will provide important insights into developing new strains of
              pest-resistant crop plants.  In addition, the results of this research will
              provide background data on the potential use of endophyte fungi as biocontrol
              agents against insect herbivores.
