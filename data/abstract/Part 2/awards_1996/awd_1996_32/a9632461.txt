Abstract    :
              A feasibility study will be undertaken to facilitate the collection of underway
              oceanographic and meteorological data from the increased use of Volunteer
              Observing Ships (VOS).  A major element of a VOS installation is the wiring
              that links sensors to data loggers and satellite transmitters.  The feasibility
              of removing the need for the wiring will be explored by seeking a wireless
              means of signal transmission.  Three possible solutions will be
              investigated:(1) a radio modem, (2) an acoustic modem, and (3) a power
              line/inductive coupled system.  Different ships may require different
              approaches or combinations of approaches.  Wireless system  benefits
              include:(1) greatly reduced time to install data gathering systems on ships,(2)
              increased flexibility, including the ability to quickly relocate sensors for
              better performance, (3) portability, making it easier to move a meteorological
              system from ship to ship, and (4) the ability to obtain real-time data, such as
              sea-surface temperature, from difficult locations onboard or inside the ship
              without the need to run expensive cabling through bulkheads.
