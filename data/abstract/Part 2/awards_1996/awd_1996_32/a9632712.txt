Abstract    :
              9632712  Tarn  International travel support is provided by the National Science 
              Foundation to attend the IARP Workshop on Subsea Robotics to be  held in
              Toulon, France, March 27-29, 1996.    Professor Tarn's functions at the
              workshop will be the following:    1)  to present a paper on "Dynamical Model
              for a Free-Floating    Underwater Robotic Vehicle with Multiple Robotic   
              Manipulators", and  2)  as an IARP representative to the workshop from the
              United    States.    His paper is the first attempt to obtain an analytical
              model for  an undersea vehicle with many robot-arms in the field of  underwater
              robotics.  His presence at the workshop will  undoubtedly facilitate
              international cooperation and  fertilization of ideas on advanced research in
              the field of  robotics.  ***
