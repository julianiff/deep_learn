Abstract    :
              9632591  Newton  It is proposed to continue an investigation of the
              thermodynamic properties of concentrated electrolyte solutions and their
              interaction with rock-forming minerals and melts under deep-earth conditions. 
              Previous work has identified an important property of possible deep crust/upper
              mantle fluids, namely a low H2O activity and yet high alkali mobility of
              concentrated brines owing to pressure-induced ionic dissociation.  This
              property of brines could have important implications for melting at crustal
              levels.  The main objectives of the current study are to describe the
              activity-concentration relationships of such fluids, to determine the melting
              capability for various silicate assemblages in the presence of these brines,
              and to constrain partition coefficient of alkalis and oxygen isotopes between
              minerals and silicate melts under crustal conditions.
