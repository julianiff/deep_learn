Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9632739    A new approach for the detection of the Doppler
              wavelength shift and a corresponding new instrument (Doppler Fluorescence
              Velocimetry, DFM) for single and  two-phase flow velocity measurements will be
              investigated.  The Doppler shift is transformed into  wave intensity ratio by
              collecting the laser beams into a fluorescence chamber.  The signal is
              projected on a black background, from where a fast-color-switcher with an
              acoustic-optic-tunnel filter is used to measure the intensity ratio.  Two
              systems, a point velocimeter with a photomultiplier tube and a planar
              velocimeter with a CCD array, will be simultaneously constructed and tested. 
              It is expected that the sensitivity and the signal-to-noise ratio will increase
              significantly.  If successful, the system will allow for higher frequency
              response and simpler operation with out  system alignment.  The objective of
              the project is to prove the feasibility of the concept, and to find the most
              suitable areas of application.    The proposed concept may lead to significant
              increase in versality and efficiency of velocity measurements in some
              conditions as compared to the laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV), Phase-Doppler
              anemometry (PDA), and particle image velocimetry (PIV).  ***
