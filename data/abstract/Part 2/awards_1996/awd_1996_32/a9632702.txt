Abstract    :
              9632702  Mazumdar       The purpose of the proposed project is to find suitable 
              methods for obtaining the statistical distribution of electric  power system
              production costs by taking into account the major  sources of uncertainty that
              include generator outages, load, and  fuel prices.  Information on the
              distributions is important for  risk evaluation, fuel inventory planning, model
              validation, and  sensitivity analysis of planning decisions.  A distinguishing 
              feature of the project will be explicit modeling of the  stochastic processes
              associated with these generation outages and  chronological load.  The
              determination of the expected values of  these distributions does not require
              the consideration of these  random processes, but for computation of higher
              order statistics  such as the standard deviation or estimating the entire 
              distribution, this is necessary.  Consideration of these  processes for
              estimating the temporal correlations between the  amounts of energy production
              makes the analytical computations  difficult and challenging.  It is argued in
              the proposal that  this work will maintain its relevance after deregulation and
              the  arrival of the competitive market structure in the operation of  electric
              power companies.  ***
