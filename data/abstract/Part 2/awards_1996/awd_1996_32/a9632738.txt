Abstract    :
                    9632738  SOLOW  As part of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field
              Studies, Phase  2 program this project will conduct a retrospective analysis of
               data previously collected from a moored array along the southern  side of
              Georges Bank. The goal of the project is to study  interannual to interdecadal
              variations in the relative abundance or  composition of zooplankton communities
              on and around Georges Bank.  Three factors are hypothesized to control
              zooplankton communities:  1) size-selective predation, 2) mesoscale advective
              or "wash-out"  events, and 3) vertical mixing.  Tests of these hypotheses will
              be  considered during the three phases of this study.  First, a newly 
              developed statistical technique will be applied to MARMAP  zooplankton data to
              identify trends in zooplankton composition on  Georges Bank and the three
              adjacent regions, i.e., the Gulf of  Maine, Southern New England, and the
              Mid-Atlantic Bight. Next,  historical data on predator abundance, sea surface
              temperature, and  wind/thermal stratification will be used to develop
              predictions  about the expected effects on regional zooplankton compositions. 
              Third, the analyses will be extended beyond the MARMAP period (1977-  1987), by
              incorporating data both from earlier surveys (Atlantis,  1939-1941; Continuous
              Plankton Recorder, 1962-1989) and from Phase  I GLOBEC (1994-1996).  ***
