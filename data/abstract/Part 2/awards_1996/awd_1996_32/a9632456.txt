Abstract    :
                9632456 Osgood  This research project aims for greater fundamental
              understanding of non-equilibrium chemistries at semiconductor surfaces
              appropriate for advanced approaches to epitaxial growth of II-VI thin films,
              including new surface cleaning/preparation techniques, and routes to sequential
              reactions which are applicable to the technique of atomic layer epitaxy.  The
              overall objective is to understand fundamental microscopic mechanisms in two
              classes of model molecular systems for light-assisted epitaxies(MOCVD, MOMBE,
              and ALE); metal alkyls(di-methyl zinc and di-ethyl cadmium) and Group VI
              halides(H2S and H2Se) on CdTe and ZnSe surfaces will be studied.  Auger and
              photoelectron spectroscopies along with thermal desorption and time of flight
              mass spectroscopy will be used to assess reaction products and binding sites,
              ejected fragment translational energy, and reaction cross sections. %%% The
              project is multidisciplinary combining fundamental materials chemistry and
              materials science synthesis and processing studies with advanced
              characterization tools and analysis methods to address forefront issues in a
              topical area of technological relevance and high potential payoff.  The
              research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental
              level to several aspects of advanced electronic/photonic devices and integrated
              circuitry.  The knowledge and understanding gained from this research project
              is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of
              advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a
              basis for designing and producing improved materials, and materials
              combinations.  An important feature of the program is the integration of
              research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and
              technologically significant area. ***
