Abstract    :
              9632617  Demarest    This project represents a university/industry partnership
              to  establish an applications-directed research laboratory in the  lightwave
              technology field. Contingent on an anticipated $1M award  (75% of which is for
              the purchase of state-of-the-art lightwave  test equipment) by U.S. Sprint, a
              Kansas-based corporation, four  faculty researchers and eight graduate students
              will initiate  research in lightwave areas consistent with the researchers' 
              experience and interests. These include coherent modulation and  detection,
              soliton generation and transmission, and optical  emission spectrometry for
              plasma etching monitoring and diagnosis.  The establishment of the laboratory
              will yield benefits to both  students at The University of Kansas and to Kansas
              industry. It  will be the only lightwave laboratory in Kansas and will be the 
              focus for higher education and human resource development in  lightwave
              technologies.
