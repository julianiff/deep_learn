Abstract    :
              9632351  Spada  Under an SGER award a study will be made of the possible  role
              of electron transfer from frictionally produced  electrical charges on the
              degradation of high-performance  lubricants of the perfluoroalkyl ether (PFPE)
              class of  lubricants.  Electrochemical studies will be carried out  under
              oxygen-free and low-oxygen atmospheres to assess the  electrochemical activity
              of these relatively stable  molecules.  The study could be a first step in
              determining  the significance of tribochemical events in lubricant  breakdown
              in general.      March 12, 1996           Jorn Larsen-Basse
