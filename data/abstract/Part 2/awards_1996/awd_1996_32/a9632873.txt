Abstract    :
              ***  9632873  Tubbesing  This award provides funding for the fifth in a series
              of  joint conferences convened by the Earthquake Engineering  Research
              Institute and the Japan Institute of Social Safety  Sciences.  The workshop
              will be held in Los Angeles,  California on January 15-17, 1997, accelerating
              the  traditional four year time frame between workshops to take  advantage of
              lessons emerging in the aftermath of the  Northridge and Kobe earthquakes.  It
              will capitalize on  increasing research collaboration between the U.S and Japan
               and strengthen ties between members of the professional  communities and
              policy makers from the two countries.  It is  expected that papers and working
              group records, issued as  proceedings, will have substantial utility for those 
              interested in post disaster recovery and reconstruction in  the U.S. and
              Japan.***
