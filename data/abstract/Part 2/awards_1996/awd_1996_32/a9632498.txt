Abstract    :
              This research project addresses seismic performance of a special moment frame
              (SMF) system with precast SRC columns and composite steel beams.  The proposed
              framing system is composed of precast SRC column trees with strong connection
              to steel beam stubs.  The center portion of the composite steel beam is then
              field spliced.  The spliced location is the designated energy dissipative
              region, which can be in the form of either conventional beam plastic hinging or
              some mechanical energy dissipation devices.  The selection of this type of
              composite framing system and their potential for popular use in the United
              States system are based on two main reasons.  First, SRC columns with composite
              steel beam construction has been accepted by design engineers for tall
              buildings in low to moderate seismic regions-column steel shape is for
              structural use as well as for erection purposes.  Second, based on the poor
              performance of connections in steel SMFs during the 1994 Northridge earthquake,
              it is highly desirable to move the plastic hinge away from the column face. 
              Several issues remain to be resolved and verified, however, before seismic
              design guidelines can be developed.  These include the seismic performance of
              SRC columns with strong connections and beam spliced bending in the strong or
              weak axis of the column.  The ability to predict the frame's seismic response
              also remains to be established.  The work under this project includes the
              design, per 1994 UBC or NEHRP Seismic Provisions of a 12-story prototype
              building with perimeter composite SMFs.  Two full-scale subassemblies,
              including exterior and interior beam-to-column joints, respectively, will be
              tested cyclically in a quasistatic manner.  Analytical studies of the seismic
              response of test models will also be conducted.  This is a 2nd-year award under
              the No. 94-154 initiative `Composite and Hybrid Structures.`
