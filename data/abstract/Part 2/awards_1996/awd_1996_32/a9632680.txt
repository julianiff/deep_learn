Abstract    :
              9632680  McMillan    This project is designed to capitalize on (i) the existence
              of an  unusually large number of productive neuroscientists at a public 
              university in a rural state as well as faculty in the Departments  of
              Mathematical Sciences and Computer Science whose work relates to  neuroscience
              and (ii) the desire of a group of well-known  computational neuroscientists at
              prestigious institutions  throughout the country, as well as in Europe, to
              establish a  literal and virtual collaboratory that will facilitate their 
              ability to exchange ideas as well as to share facilities. The  primary goal
              (1-5 years) of the project is to establish an  Institute of Computational
              Neuroscience at Montana State  University-Bozeman (MSU). In addition to the
              neuroscientists  already at MSU, the institute will, at least for the first few
               years, consist of two new on-site faculty members and five  affiliate members.
              The affiliates will spend significant time at  MSU each year and will develop a
              network to enhance their  collaborative interactions when they are at their
              home  institutions. A long term goal will include efforts to recruit as  many
              affiliates as possible to become resident members of the  institute.
