Abstract    :
              9632690  Sondhi    This grant supports work by a beginning assistant professor
              at  Princeton University.  The proposed work involves study of  various aspects
              of quantum hall effect.  These include spin  textures (skyrmions) in quantum
              Hall effect and other itinerant  ferromagnets and an analysis of symmetries and
              dissipation near  quantum critical points.  The latter has been stimulated by
              the  observation of symmetries of the nonlinear response in quantum  Hall
              experiments.  Finally, there are plans to provide  theoretical support to local
              experimental groups studying quantum  Hall effect in 2-d electron gases and
              also in quasi 2-d Bechgaard  salts.   %%%  Last decade has seen an explosion of
              activity in quantum Hall  effect, a novel state of electrons in very high
              magnetic fields.  In spite of certain superficial similarities to a
              superconductor,  another anomalous state for electrons, this state is 
              fundamentally different.  The PI, a beginning assistant professor  at
              Princeton, has been a pioneer in the theory of this field, in  introducing some
              novel magnetic defects and related phenomena for  dissipation.  He will further
              advance this work.  He is also  proposing a theory-experimental collaboration
              with his colleagues  at Princeton to explore new opportunities.  ***
