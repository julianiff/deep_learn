Abstract    :
              9632937  Scherer  The analogy between electromagnetic wave propagation in
              multi-dimensional periodic structures, and electron wave propagation in real
              crystals, have proven to be a very fruitful one. Initial efforts were motivated
              by the prospect, of a "photonic bandgap"; a frequency band in 3-dimensional
              dielectric structures, in which electromagnetic waves are forbidden,
              irrespective of propagation direction in space.  These 3-dimensionally periodic
              dielectric structures are frequently called "photonic crystals".  These can be
              useful in opto-electronics as electromagnetic microcavities for so-called
              "zero-thresold lasers" and single-mode light emitting diodes.  Such structures
              would exhibit inhibited spontaneous emission, which could lower the power
              requirements and increase reliability, particularly of optical arrays. 
              Alternately, such structures can show enhanced spontaneous emission which would
              allow faster modulation speeds for optical interconnects.    This renewal grant
              is funded in parallel with a substantially identical one by  Prof. Ely
              Yablonovich at UCLA.  Funding allows continuation of the joint Caltech/UCLA
              effort to develop the technology for making 3-dimensional photonic crystal
              structures at the scale of optical wavelengths, and to improve the structural
              precision and midgap reflectivity of these structures.  Such refined photonic
              crystal structures shculd lend themselves to opto-electronic technology, and
              they be generically useful in optical science.  ***
