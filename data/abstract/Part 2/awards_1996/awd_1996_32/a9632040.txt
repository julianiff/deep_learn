              Abstract  ATM-9632040  Fritz, S.C.  LeHigh University  Title: Sub-Decadal
              Reconstruction of Drought Patterns in North  American's Arid Interior: the last
              2000 years    Recent paleoclimatic studies from several regions of western
              North  America suggest that the climate of the last century may not be 
              representative of long-term patterns of climate variability.  
              Paleolimnological work from southeastern North Dakota suggests that  intervals
              of severe multi-decadal drought have been common during  the last two
              millennia.  This award supports a study to reconstruct  at sub-decadal
              intervals the frequency, duration, and magnitude of  major drought in the
              northern Great Plains of North America and to  examine how these moisture
              patterns are manifest in vegetation,  hydrology, and geomorphic processes. 
              Reconstructions will be based  on analysis of Kettle Lake in northwestern North
              Dakota, which has  laminated, probably varved sediments.  This site has the
              potential  to provide an absolute chronology of drought in the north-central 
              grasslands of North America that can be linked to records elsewhere  to
              reconstruct broader scale atmospheric circulation patterns in  the past.  The
              project is part of the PEP-1 transect for western  North America and is
              essential for characterization of the east to  west structure of the climate
              system.
