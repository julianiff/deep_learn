Abstract    :
              ***  9632407  Krstulovic-Opara  This goal of this study is to explore a novel
              concept of  self-prestressing High-Performance Composite Infrastructural 
              Systems created through the selective use of high-  performance materials. The
              investigation will explore a  distinctive new concept of using Shape Memory
              Alloys as  muscular systems embedded in continuous fiber-mat High  Performance
              Fiber Reinforced Concretes to develop an  innovative, stay-in-place formwork
              capable of self-inducing  prestressing, after the "core" of the element has
              been cast-  in-place. The stay-in-place formwork will be used to: (1) 
              self-induce multiaxial post-tensioning of the entire  structural element, and
              (2) act as surface reinforcement,  thus replacing conventional reinforcing
              bars. This way  partially-cast-in-place self-prestressing will be developed. 
              If successful, the proposed concept will lead to: (1)  simpler, faster and more
              cost-effective construction, (2)  markedly improved structural performance, (3)
              reduction in  element size and weigh leading to the reduction in dead  load,
              earthquake induced loadings and an increase in usable  floor space, and (4)
              improved durability of the  structure.***
