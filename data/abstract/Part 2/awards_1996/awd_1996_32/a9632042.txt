Abstract    :
              9632042   Kovacevic   This GOALI/Graduate Student in Industry award will support
              two graduate students as they explore gas turbine efficiency improvements made
              by innovations in fine hole laser drilling.  The amount of compressed  air
              needed to cool turbine blades can be reduced with  precise and accurate control
              of size, shape and orientation of the small film cooling holes on the turbine
              blade. Pratt and Whitney and Control Vision are the industrial collaborators on
              this award.  The graduate students will be in residence at Pratt and Whitney
              for the experimental work, using a newly developed industrial vision system
              provided by Control Vision for sensing in the laser drilling process. They will
              investigate H-infinity adaptive control methods and Mu-synthesis robust control
              designs for the laser drilling process, using vision feedback of the hole size
              and shape.   This technical approach is a high pay-off opportunity. 
              Predictions are that with these improvements in precision hole making
              technology  it may be possible to improve gas turbine efficiency by 0.5%
              without changing the turbine design.  This precise control of fine hole making
              has many other manufacturing applications.
