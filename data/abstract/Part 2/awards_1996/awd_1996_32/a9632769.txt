Abstract    :
              Advances in network and processor technology are greatly changing  the
              communication and computational power of local-area clusters  of workstations
              and personal computers.  In particular, the  replacement of Ethernets by newer
              switched network technologies,  which provide both higher throughput and lower
              latency, presents  an opportunity for operating systems to better use network 
              resources.  This research seeks to improve the performance of  applications
              through distributed (cluster-wide) resource  management.  The project will
              develop algorithms that permit the  effective sharing of all network resources:
               processors, network,  memory, and disk storage.   For example, programs on
              heavily-  loaded nodes can use available memory on idle nodes for both file 
              system and virtual memory backing store, rather than disk,  thereby reducing
              the data latency on access to that data.  As another example, applications may
              migrate to nodes that  provide either a better processing environment or a
              better memory  environment for their execution.  A key issue in developing 
              algorithms for such closely-coupled system is finding the right  balance in
              order to optimize system-wide performance while  minimizing any degradation of
              performance on individual systems  as a result of network-wide resource
              sharing.  ***
