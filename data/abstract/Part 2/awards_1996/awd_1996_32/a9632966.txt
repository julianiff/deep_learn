Abstract    :
              The American Mathematical Society, the Institute for Mathematical  Statistics,
              and the Society for Industrial and Applied  Mathematics administers a series of
              Summer Research Conferences  during 1996.  It is planned to hold seven one-week
              conferences at  Mt. Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA during the period between
               June and August 1996.      The topics for these conferences were selected by
              the AMS-IMS-SIAM Committee on Joint Summer Research Conferences in the 
              Mathematical Sciences:    1.  Adaptive Selection of Models and Statistical
              Procedures-  Andrew R. Barron    2.  Discrete and Computational Geometry: Ten
              Years Later- Jacob  E. Goodman    3.  Quantization- Lewis Coburn    4. 
              Stochastic Inference, Monte Carlo and Empirical Methods- Ian  McKeague    5. 
              Random Matrices, Statistical Mechanics, and Painleve  Transcendents- Pavel
              Bleher    6.  Classification Problems in C*-Algebras and Dynamics- Terry A. 
              Loring    7.  Optimization Methods in Partial Differential Equations- Irena 
              Lasiecka
