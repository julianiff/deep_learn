Abstract    :
              ***  9632052  Walker     This STTR Phase I project will demonstrate the
              feasibility of a continuous process of producing rugged, low moisture content,
              high bandwidth, gradient index plastic optical fiber. Existing Japanese
              production methods result in bandwidths which are three to ten times less than
              theoretically possible, and the bandwidth of the fiber is not stable and
              reproducible. The production rate is intrinsically limited by the batch nature
              of the process and, or, multi-step procedure. In the United States,  the
              High-Speed Plastic Network (HSPN) consortium was formed in 1994, and is
              supported by a $5 million Advanced Research Projects Agency grant.  A member of
              that team has licensed one of the Japanese batch technologies to fabricate the
              above type of fiber. This project will develop a novel, low cost, continous
              production process for the fiber.  The fiber will have a stable bandwidth of >
              2 GHz.km, be stable from -40 C to + 150 C, have low moisture uptake,
              attenuation of less than 150dB/kilometer and be stable to radiation exposure up
              to 1000 Rad.   This type of fiber is expected to have great utility in high
              speed local area networks. Local area networks have inadequate band width for
              the anticipated needs in the coming years. Gradient index plastic optical fiber
              will be the most cost effective solution with adequate band-width. At present
              there is no satisfactory production process for a rugged version of this fiber.
