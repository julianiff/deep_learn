Abstract    :
              9632032  Hill  The plan is to establish the School of Mathematics at Georgia
              Tech as the center for applied analysis in the Southeast.  This will be
              accomplished by building on present departmental strengths in applied analysis
              (differential equations, dynamical systems, mathematical physics, numerical
              analysis, probability), using this group of core faculty as a base and
              expanding on its current activities.  The Applied Analysis Center will have a
              small administrative/technical staff, permanent facilities for visitors and
              postdocs, an electronic network of regional applied analysts, a liaison center
              to facilitate and encourage interaction with industry and a student placement
              service.  Regular annual conferences and workshops at Georgia Tech will be
              complemented by a distinguished lecturer series, a long-term visitor program
              and a regional lectureship program in which our researchers will visit regional
              universities, colleges and community colleges on a regular basis.  The net
              result will be a surge of research and educational activity in applied analysis
              in the Southeast.
