Abstract    :
              9632927   Storm    This  grant supports a conference on recent advances in  the 
              understanding of fundamentals of formation and breakdown  of  oxide  films  on 
              metals and on other protective  films  and  layers of special interest to
              aqueous corrosion.  There  are  individual  sessions  on oxide films  on 
              metals  and  their  breakdown,   localized  breakdown  of  passive   films  
              and  microscopic  techniques  for study,  coating  and  corrosion  protection, 
               corrosion  in  electronic  and   communication  systems,  and mechanical and
              chemical effects on oxide  film  adhesion  and  fracture. Scientists from six 
              countries  are  represented  at  the meeting.  The $4,000  supports  student 
              researchers to attend the meeting and present posters.  %%%  The  conference
              explores new developments in  the  field  of  corrosion,  which is a continuing
              problem in the performance  life    of   materials   used   in   industrial  
              machinery,  transportation, and raw materials production.  ***
