Abstract    :
              9632294  Abrahams  This grant continues DMR's  long-standing support of this 
              distinguished PI.  The work proposed here falls in the  general area of
              strongly correlated fermions (and bosons).  The list of projects includes
              several highly complex  problems of current interest in the community.  Each of
               these projects involve close collaboration with experiments  and also need
              significant breakthroughs in conceptual and  mathematical development.  The
              list includes: various  aspects and consequences of Marginal Fermi liquid
              theory,  consequences of odd-in-time magnetic correlations, large 
              magnetoresistance in perovskite manganates and inelastic  scattering in bosons
              and its effect on Bose-Einstein  condensation. The research is expected to have
              impact on  materials science, condensed matter physics and quantum  chemistry. 
              %%%  This grant supports research in the general area of theory  of novel
              materials with unusual magnetic or superconducting  properties.  Many of these
              materials need fundamentally new  conceptual advances for a clear understanding
              of their  properties.  The examples are:  new magnetic metals,  heavy  fermion
              materials (compounds based on Uranium and Cerium)  and high Tc superconductors.
