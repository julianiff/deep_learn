              of Wisconsin    Title:  Physics and Simulation of Helicon Plasma Sources   
              Abstract    This research will provide a coordinated theoretical, computational
              and experimental research program on helicon plasma sources.  These high
              density efficient sources are of interest for a variety of applications:
              neutral beam sub-micron etching of semiconductors, processing of large flat
              panel display, materials surface modification, use as a large volume plasma
              source for space simulations and for basic plasma source and wave propagation
              studies.  Despite strong interest in these source few detailed simulations have
              been carried out to better model and understand helicon sources.  The proposed
              study is very through and will address several important points.  Among these
              are:  incorporation of  off diagonal hot plasmas dielectric tensor terms which
              describe transit time damping as well as Landau process, into the ANTENA2 code
              (developed by Professor Scharer) which is used to describe 3-D wave fields and
              radial collisional and collisionless power absorption for different helicon
              antenna coil configurations and radial plasma profiles. Also the ANTENA2 code
              will be interfaced to the INDUCT95 transport code to examine the
              self-consistent plasma profile evolution and the possibly differing roles of
              bulk and fast electrons as observed in experiments.  The availability of the
              INDUCT95 code free of charge from an independent collaboration is a major gain
              to the proposed effort.  The independent collaborators wants the opportunity to
              develop the INDUCT95 transport code in tandem with the ANTENA2 code. Also, as a
              service to the community, the ANTENA2 code will be made generally available to
              other researchers during the source of the grant to answer substantial requests
              for the code.
