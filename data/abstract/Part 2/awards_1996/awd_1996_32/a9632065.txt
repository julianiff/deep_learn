Abstract    :
                  Frohnsdorff  9632065  For the U.S. to be a leader in construction technology
              in the 21st  Century, it is important that it should take action to stimulate 
              construction materials research, development and new technology  deployment
              now.  A National Coordinating  Council (NCC) has been  formed for the National
              High Performance Construction Materials and  Systems (CONMAT) Program.  The
              program plan includes aluminum,  asphalt, coatings, composites, concrete
              masonry, roofing materials,  steel wood and smart materials.  CONMAT is
              stimulating research and  development within the materials groups and helping
              provide a  mechanism for supporting a coherent national program involving 
              industry, government, and academia.
