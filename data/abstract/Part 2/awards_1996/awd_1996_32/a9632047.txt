Abstract    :
              The  long term goal of the project is to fully understand the the   mechanism of
              the ethylene-forming enzyme.  The focus of this research is   to use bioorganic
              methods to study the identity of critical active-site   residues; to provide an
              unambiguous demonstration of a suspected radical   mechanism; to finalize the
              enzymatic reaction stoichiometry; and to   create a reasonable model for the
              mechanism of oxygen activation.  Since   enzymes of this class do not follow
              classic  Pauling  theories of   enzymatic catalysis,  the need to develop new
              theories of enzymatic   catalysis for multi-transition state conversions
              provides further   significance to the work. With this award the Organic
              Dynamics Program is   supporting the research of Dr. Michael C. Pirrung  of the
              Department of   Chemistry at Duke University.  Professor Pirrung will focus his
              work on   understanding the mechanism of the ethylene-forming enzyme as an  
              available and significant member of the class of non-heme iron oxidizing  
              enzymes.  Among other reasons, the work is deemed important since the   process
              of natural ethylene production is a key step in the ripening of   fruit.
