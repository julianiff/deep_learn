Abstract    :
              9632016  Hobbie  The plant hormone auxin plays an important role in virtually
              all aspects of plant growth and development, including formation of shoots and
              roots and responses to gravity and light.  Auxin affects these processes
              through regulation of cell elongation, cell division, and cell differentiation.
               However, exactly what auxin does and how it does it at the molecular level are
              still poorly understood.  Only a few genes that act in the auxin response
              pathway have been identified.  This research is designed to increase our
              knowledge of the function and mechanism of action of auxin by means of
              characterization and anlysis of two Arabidopsis mutants with defects in a
              previously-unknown gene called AXR6.  Heterozygous axr6 mutants are
              auxin-resistant, dwarf, and bushy, consistent with a general reduction in auxin
              sensitivity.  Homozygous axr6 plants show a novel phenotype for an
              auxin-related mutant: they arrest growth as young seedlings, with defects in
              both shoots and roots.  These preliminary observations of the mutants'
              phenotype suggest that AXR6 is an essential gene involved in auxin response and
              regulation of development.  This research should bring us closer to a complete
              understanding of plant physiology and development at the molecular level, and
              especially of the role of auxin.  Such an understanding is fundamentally
              important, and should also enhance our ability to regulate plant development in
              desirable ways.
