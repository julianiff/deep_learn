Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program  will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University   of
              California Berkeley acquire an inductively coupled plasma-optical   emission
              spectrometer (ICP-OES). This equipment will enhance research in   a number of
              areas including the following: (1) semiconducting   nanocrystals  (2) 
              bioremediation of metal polluted ecosystems (3)    metallobiochemistry  (4) 
              stereognosis metal ligands (5)  oxide   superconductors (6)  molecule-to-solid
              transformations in well defined   systems (7)  C-H activation utilizing Ir, Rh,
              Re and Zr complexes (8)    synthesis of zeolites containin transition metal
              elements (9)  volume   change of soil-forming reactings using Zr reference
              frame, and (10)    growth of thermophiles under geochemically relevant
              conditions.  The inductively couple plasma-optical emission spectrometer
              (ICP-OES) is   used to determine the elemental anlaysis of most elements.  It
              uses an   inert gas which serves an an atomization source that excites many  
              elements generating their characteristic emission, which is detected.
