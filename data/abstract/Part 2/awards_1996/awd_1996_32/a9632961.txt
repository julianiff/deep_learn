Abstract    :
              9632961  Shuler  The goal of this proposed research is to identify and
              investigate  the biosynthetic significance of an unknown taxane recently 
              discovered in the Principle Investigators laboratory while  performing plant
              tissue culture experiments with certain  metabolic inhibitors.  These
              experiments involved the culture of  Taxus species which produce Taxol, an
              important new anti-cancer  drug.  It is currently generally accepted that
              baccatin III is  the direct biosynthetic precursor of Taxol.  However, recent 
              experiments by the PI indicate that baccatin III could be  selectively and
              completely inhibited without any significant  effect on Taxol production. 
              Other inhibition experiments have  shown the accumulation of a single unknown
              taxane, which is not  baccatin III, but which could,, in fact, be the direct
              precursor  of Taxol.  This proposal outlines a multidisciplinary approach to 
              identify this unknown compound and investigate its biosynthetic  significance
              using knowledge of manipulation of Taxol production  by Taxus cell cultures,
              and established techniques in  biosynthetic chemistry.  ***
