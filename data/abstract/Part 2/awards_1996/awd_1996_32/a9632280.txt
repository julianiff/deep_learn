Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS-9632280    A combined modeling and experimental investigation of
              the basic mechanisms of consolidation in the Plasma Activated Sintering (PAS)
              process will be undetaken, with illustration to a high temperature metal
              (tungsten) powder.   Special focus will be on understanding the role of the
              electric field and particle surface activation on sintering.  The phenomena
              necessary developing a manufacturing process applicable to the consolidation of
              high quality tungsten powders, including the resultant microstructure, will be
              analyzed.  The computer simulation considers five sintering mechanisms,
              including surface and grain boundary diffusion, volume diffusion from the
              surface and contact area, and evaporation-condensation.      This GOALI (Grant
              Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry) project will be performed in
              collaboration with Teledyne Co.  The company will participate to the research
              effort, provide some basic materials and equipment, and support summer
              fellowship in industry for a graduate student working on the project during the
              academic year.    The results are expected to develop a scientific foundation
              applicable to other powders than tungsten-based.  PAS has the ability to
              consolidate powders in minutes as compared to hours for conventional sintering,
              and has particular relevance to net shape manufacturing.  ***
