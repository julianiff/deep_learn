Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program   will assist
              the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University acquire a   short pulse
              laser system . This equipment will enhance research in a   number of areas
              including the following: (1)  structure and dynamics of   proteins and
              porphyrin excited states (2)  time resolved chemical   dynamics and
              spectroscopy on/in liquid helium clusters (3)  time   dependent anti-Stokes
              Raman study of intramolecular vibrational energy   redistribution (4)  coherent
              control of chemical dynamics (5)  electron   transfer studies in biological and
              solid state systems, and (6)  two   electron charge transfer processes.    A
              tunable laser can provide important information about chemical   reactivity. 
              Its use may enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the   properties of
              reactivity and nonreactivity of molecules.
