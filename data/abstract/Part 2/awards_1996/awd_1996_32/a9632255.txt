              Abstract  ATM-9632255  Maasch, Kirk  University of Maine  Title: A Theory of
              Global Climate Change on Millennial Time Scales    In the northern hemisphere,
              large and rapid shifts in environmental  conditions have occurred repeatedly
              over the last glacial-  interglacial cycle.  Indications are that climate
              change occurs on  two characteristic time scales, roughly 1 - 3,000 years and 5
              -  10,000 years.  Evidence for millennial-scale climate variability  has been
              found in ice cores drilled through the Greenland ice  sheet, sediment cores
              from the North Atlantic Ocean, pollen records  from both North America and
              Europe, and glacial deposits in North  America.  Paleoclimate records from the
              southern hemisphere also  show climatic variability on millennial time scales. 
              While  interhemispheric synchrony has been observed for the last  termination,
              the record of alpine glaciers and lake sediments in  the Andes and New Zealand
              now suggest that these higher frequency  changes may also be synchronous with
              the climatic fluctuations of  the Northern Hemisphere.  This award supports a
              project designed   to model the higher frequency variations of climate.  One of
              the  challenges of developing such a theory for millennial-scale climate 
              change will be to account for interhemispheric connections within  the context
              of a global environmental system.  While changes in the  thermohaline
              circulation of the ocean have been postulated as a  cause for rapid climate
              change on millennial time scales in and  around the North Atlantic,
              interhemispheric synchrony would  implicate the atmosphere as a key factor in
              global climate change  on this time scale.
