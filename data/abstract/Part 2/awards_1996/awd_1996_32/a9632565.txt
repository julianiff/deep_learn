Abstract    :
              The project will investigate a central question for democratic government:  how
              citizens learn and form opinions about political choices.  The convergence of
              low-information models of rationality and recent work in cognitive neuroscience
              indicates that the relationship between emotion and cognition is central to
              political information processing. Judgmental heuristics are often used by
              individuals to reason about choices when, as is usually the case, they possess
              incomplete information and limited ability to consider it.  Emotions function
              as timesaving cues, or short cuts, in the cognitive process of integrating old
              and new information.  Because emotions often operate pre-consciously, research
              into their role demands experimental conditions under which the investigator
              has greater control of the informational environment than can typically be
              achieved in survey-based research.  In this work, experimental research will
              test the relative importance of these factors in political choice.  The
              experiment will assess whether emotional and cognitive reactions are distinct
              and salient factors in the process of attitude formation.  The experiment will
              also test previous survey-based evidence that anxiety can affect political
              learning by inhibiting prior attitudes and focusing attention on new
              information.
