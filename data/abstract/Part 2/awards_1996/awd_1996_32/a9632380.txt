Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      The PIs propose to examine the climatic effects of a warming trend
              on the belowground component of plant respiration.  The results of this study
              will compliment the results of a large study on the Alaskan North Slope that is
              examining the effects of global warming on the flux of carbon dioxide from
              plants and soil.  The assessment of the belowground component of the carbon
              dioxide flux will allow researchers to differentiate between the carbon dioxide
              flux due to respiration of living plants from that resulting from decay of
              organic matter incorporated into the frozen soil. This study will be an
              important component of ongoing studies relating the tundra ecosystem to climate
              in the Arctic.
