Abstract    :
                This award supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student at
              the University of Florida.  The project is to study the determinants of risky
              behaviors by adolescents in Uganda which facilitate the spread of HIV.  A
              stratified sample of 260 adolescents aged 13-19 will be drawn from three areas
              and an extensive survey administered on demographic and personal behavior.  A
              saliva test will determine the total number of positive HIV cases in the
              sample, and test the central research hypothesis that school status is a
              protective factor against risk-based diseases.   Eighty persons from the total
              sample will be randomly selected for individual interviews and focus groups. 
              The correlation of epidemiological data with qualitative responses to the
              demographic and survey data and interviews will allow a powerful analysis of
              the actual influence of the socio-economic context on adolescent vulnerability
              to risky diseases.  This research is important because a good part of mortality
              across the world can be attributed to risky behaviors (e.g., smoking,
              over-eating, under-exercising, sexual promiscuity, etc.).  Major advances in
              human well being will depend on behavior changes which are not well understood
              at present.  This project will advance the base of knowledge of adolescent
              behavior research, as well as enable the final Ph.D. training of a student who
              will contribute of the nation's base of scientific investigators and our store
              of expertise about this important region of the world.
