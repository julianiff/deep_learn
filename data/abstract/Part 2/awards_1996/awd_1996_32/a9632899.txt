Abstract    :
              This project will help support a conference on the magnetization of  the ocean
              crust.  In the past two decades there have been a number  of developments that
              have led to improved understanding of ocean  crust magnetization; the
              acquisition and analysis of near-bottom  data, a much larger availability of
              upper crustal rock samples from  the ocean floor, and recent access to lower
              crustal samples from  drill holes, fracture zones, and ophiolites.  The last
              conference  that specifically addressed this issue was held in 1978.
