Abstract    :
              This project will produce the first sample of the nineteenth century service
              sector. It will produce a data set containing economic and demographic data on
              middlemen who operated businesses in 89 counties in 10 North Central States
              during the 1860-1880 period. Names of proprietors and locations of businesses
              will be collected from statewide business directories and linked to the
              manuscript censuses of population, agriculture, and manufacturing. Completion
              of the project will provide quantitative and consistent evidence on changes in
              the marketing sector of the Midwest during the period when the practice of
              standard grading and the use forward contracts on grain were spreading. The
              data promise to add a new dimension to our understanding of the economic
              development of the Midwest and offer long term research opportunities to
              scholars in economics, history and other social sciences.
