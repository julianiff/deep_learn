Abstract    :
              9632043  Murty    This GOALI grant supports an engineering student for a one 
              year period in industry to investigate the effects of alloy  chemistry and
              process factors on specific intermetallic  phases which influence zirconium
              alloy (Zircaloy) properties  and performance.  Intermetallics undergo changes
              in  structure that affect mechanical properties and corrosion  resistance.  The
              structural include phase nucleation, growth  and restructuring during material
              processing, and these  changes are strongly influenced by the concentrations of
              the  alloying elements.  Variables include beta-quench  temperature and quench
              rate, post-beta-quench cold-work and  annealing, and subsequent
              cold-work/anneal cycles to control  final precipitate morphology.  The research
              examines  corrosion (nodular and uniform), microstructure (with  particular
              attention to intermetallics), mechanical  properties, and manufacturability,
              evaluated using automated  ball indentation.  Zirconium alloy sheet material is
              used to  simulate tubing for ease of fabrication and testing.  The  study is
              performed in collaboration with the General  Electric Company's Zircaloy
              manufacturing center in  Wilmington, NC, and Vallecitos nuclear center in
              California.  %%%  Zircaloys are widely used in fission reactors as thin-walled 
              tubing for cladding nuclear fuel, intermediate grids,  channels (BWRs), and
              calandria tubing (PHWRs).  The research  program allows a student to learn
              on-site the metallurgical  factors associated with the application of this
              alloy.  ***
