Abstract    :
                  This project will apply ion microprobe analyses to examine  variation of
              trace elements (B, F, Mg, Sr) and oxygen isotopes at  sub-monthly resolution in
              Porites corals from Johnston Atoll  (central Pacific) and Two-Mile Reef (South
              Africa).  The goals are  twofold:  to determine covariation among trace
              elements in order to  assess their relationship to water temperature, and to
              examine the  relationship between coral growth geometry and the geochemical 
              tracers.  Several colonies will be analyzed at each site to examine  local
              variability and instrumental records of water temperature are  available.
