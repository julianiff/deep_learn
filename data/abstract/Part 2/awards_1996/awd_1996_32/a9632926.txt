              Abstract  ATM-9632926     MacDonald, Glen M.  University of California, Los
              Angeles   Title: Collaborative Research: Paleoenvironmental Time Series from   
                    Postglacial Lake Basins on Kola Peninsula, Russia        It is poorly
              known how dramatic changes in deglacial and Holocene   climates in the North
              Atlantic region propagated into the Eurasian   arctic.  Lacustrine and
              estuarine records from the Kola Peninsula,   adjacent to the North Cape
              Current, the eastern-most limb of the   North Atlantic current, provide
              archives to assess postglacial and   Holocene variations in lakes, vegetation
              and tree line and   inferred changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation. 
              Extant   cores from northern Kola Peninsula provide estuarine and lacustrine  
              records spanning at least the last 12,000 yrs.  Preliminary   analyses
              demonstrate that these sediments are rich in biologic   remains, ideal for
              securing a reliable radiocarbon chronology and   determining environmental
              changes.  This PALE/ARCSS award supports   lake coring on a transect from the
              tundra-dominated northern coast   to the forested center of Kola Peninsula. 
              This  research will  utilize an array of paleoecological techniques such  as
              pollen,  diatom, macrofossil and sediment analyses, augmented by  recent 
              advances in stomate, chironomid and cellulose stable isotope   analyses.  To
              strengthen the paleoenvironmental interpretations of   the cores, modern
              sediment samples will be collected from lakes to   statistically calibrate
              pollen, stomate, diatom, and chironomid   records with present climatic,
              edaphic and vegetation conditions.   The research will provide new late glacial
              and Holocene  records  from the western Russian arctic, currently a void in
              global   paleoclimatic time series.  The collaborative research is with Dr. 
              Steven L. Forman at the Ohio State University (ATM-9600126).
