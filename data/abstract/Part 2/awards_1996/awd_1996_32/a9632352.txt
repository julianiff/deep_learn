Abstract    :
              9632352  Yeh  This action is to support U.S. participation in the International 
              Workshop on Tsunami Mitigation and Risk Assessment, to be held in 
              Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, Kamchatka, Russia, August 1996.  This  workshop is
              organized by the Institute of Computational  Technologies, Russian Academy of
              Sciences, Novosibirsk, Russia.    The workshop theme is "the state-of-the-art
              of the problem of  long-term tsunami prognosis (estimation of tsunami risk)",
              and  the following topics will be discussed:  (1) paleo-tsunami research,  (2)
              historical catalogs and data bases,  (3) seismo-tectonics of tsunami,  (4)
              numerical models of tsunami behavior,  (5) methods of tsunami-risk
              calculations, and  (6) mitigation and counter-measures  The format of the
              workshop will be round-table discussions with  40-minute invited presentations
              on each particular topic.    This workshop is a follow-on to three major
              workshops on tsunamis  held in the United States during 1995: Tsunami Deposit
              Workshop,  Seattle, Washington, 21-23 May, and the two NSF-supported 
              workshops, Tsunami Measurement Workshop, Estes Park, Colorado, 28-  30 June,
              and Second International Workshop on Long-Wave Runup  Models, Friday Harbor,
              Washington, 12-16 September.    In order to use the limited funds as
              effectively as possible, the  PI will establish close communication, via the
              Internet e-mail  system, with the US tsunami scientists and engineers who are 
              unable to attend the workshop.  Tsunami researchers and  practitioners are
              already in close communication via the Tsunami  Internet mailing list sponsored
              by the NOAA (National Atmospheric  and Oceanic Administration) Pacific Marine
              and Environmental  Laboratory (PMEL) in Seattle.    Active participation of US
              scientists and engineers in this  workshop in Kamchatka will contribute
              significantly to the  continued efforts toward tsunami disaster mitigation, and
              assure  the continued activity and momentum in this important area of  disaster
              mitigation.  ***
