Abstract    :
              9632069  Wright    What happens in our brains when we learn?  How much of what 
              happens is due  to processes that first appeared in the brains of ancient 
              ancestors, and  how much is due to more recently evolved mechanisms?  The  work
              proposed  here examines, for the first time,  the evolution of  mechanisms of 
              learning.  Through neurophysiological and behavioral studies  of present-day 
              species with known relationships to each other, we propose  to chart the 
              evolution of specific cellular mechanisms of learning.  This  approach will  1)
              address the question of whether and how mechanisms of  learning change  across
              evolution, and 2) provide new insights into learning  mechanisms of  modern
              species.
