Abstract    :
              9632819  Huber  This project will prepare and characterize supercooled hydrogen 
              in small volumes.  Molecular hydrogen is a composite boson,  lighter than
              helium, for which a superfluid phase has been  predicted if the material can be
              supercooled below 5 K.  Experiments will be conducted to prepare supercooled
              hydrogen  micro volumes and study them by spectroscopic techniques.  The  work
              is of general interest since bosonic materials display  unusual behavior such
              as superconductivity or Bose-Einstein  condensation, as well as superfluidity. 
              The challenge in this  project is to supercool molecular hydrogen substantially
              below  its crystallization temperature of 13.8 K.  Hydrogen in  microporous
              media and unsupported clusters of hydrogen will be  investigated.  The research
              is of fundamental interest in  condensed matter and materials physics.  %%% 
              This project deals with molecular hydrogen confined to small  volumes as in
              aerosol droplets or in microporous media.  When so  constrained, the hydrogen
              is more likely to supercool.  If  supercooled hydrogen liquid can be obtained
              at temperatures below  5 K, theoretical arguments suggest that a superfluid
              state may be  obtained.  Achievement of molecular hydrogen in a new superfluid 
              state would represent a major discovery in condensed matter  physics.  This
              project will develop techniques to obtain micro  volumes of molecular hydrogen
              at low temperatures, study the  micro volumes by spectroscopic techniques, and
              search for  superfluidity of hydrogen in the microvolumes.  ***
