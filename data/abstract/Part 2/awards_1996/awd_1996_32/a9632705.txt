Abstract    :
              This project will complete theoretical calculations of the scattering of ionic
              and neutral oxygen and the extension of the methodology developed to other
              systems of importance in the upper atmosphere.  The first component of the work
              is to study the interaction between O+ and O, one of the most important
              collision processes in the upper atmosphere.  Secondly, the PI will use the
              coupled channel model for the interaction of O+ with O to calculate various
              other properties of the system that can be compared with high precision
              spectroscopic data.
