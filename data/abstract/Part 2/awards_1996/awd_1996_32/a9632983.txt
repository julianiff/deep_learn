Abstract    :
              9632983  Roemmich    Support is provided to continue the high-density, eddy 
              resolving eXpendable  Bathymetric Thermometer (XBT) transects in the Pacific 
              Ocean. The XBT  network is designed to observe the modes of variability in 
              ocean circulation on  annual to decadal time scales and on space scales from
              that  of boundary  currents and fronts to ocean basins. A principal objective 
              is to explore the role of  the time varying ocean circulation in climate
              variability  through redistribution of  heat and salt in the upper kilometer.
              Quarterly XBT  transects on board  commercial ships will be conducted for an
              additional three  years and a data  archive will be accessible via the World
              Wide Web. The  Analysis will focus on  the transport of mass, heat and salt by
              ocean currents and  on the interpretation  of observed variability using a
              variety of complementary  data sets like satellite  altimetry, broadscale XBTs,
              air-sea fluxes.
