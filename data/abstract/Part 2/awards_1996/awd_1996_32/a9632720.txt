Abstract    :
              9632720  Lewis  This award supports a Plant Biochemistry course which will be
              given at Washington State University in the summers of 1997, 1999, and 2001. 
              Experts in the field from the University as well as investigators from other
              institutions will lecture and give informal presentations during an intensive
              two week program.  This course, which has been successfully been given several
              times in the past is an excellent chance for graduate students, postdoctoral
              fellows, and college teachers from all over the United States to update their
              knowledge in a field which has not received sufficient attention recently and
              hear about the latest  advances from the leaders in the field.  The use of
              university facilities reduces costs and leads to an informal atmosphere.  ***
