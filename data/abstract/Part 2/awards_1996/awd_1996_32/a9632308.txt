Abstract    :
              9632308  Brosnan      The study of natural catastrophes, such as volcanoes, 
              provides vital information on their role in the ecology and  evolution of
              communities.  Rare events, may have important,  even pivotal roles in
              ecosystems, but they are hard to  study.  From a conservation standpoint, rare
              events may be  of greater importance to diversity patterns than normal  events.
               Studies of natural catastrophes can in turn provide  a biological and
              predictive framework for interpreting human  impacts on natural systems.  This
              knowledge is vital to the  design of biologically meaningful conservation
              plans.  Effects of volcanic eruptions on reef ecosystems (e.g. Mount 
              Pinatubo). By studying effects of the current eruption on  the reefs around
              Montserrat, we have an opportunity to  expand our knowledge of volcanic impacts
              on reef ecology,  and strengthen our effectiveness in reef conservation.    Dr.
              Brosnan will study the effects of volcanic eruption on  the reef community by
              repeating surveys of the reefs.  She  will set up permanent monitoring quadrats
              at impacted reefs  (south and east coasts), and control reefs on the northwest 
              coast that receive no volcanic input and monitor changes in  the reef community
              and compare changes in impacted and  nonimpacted reefs.    ***
