Abstract    :
              9632654  Madin    The  purpose of this project is to quantify predation
              mortality  on  four   target   organisms   (cod  and   haddock   larvae,  
              Calanus  finmarchicus,  Pseudocalanus  spp.) by  fishes  and  zooplanton  on 
              Georges Bank.  The principal objectives are:  1) to determine bank-  wide 
              distribution  and  abundance of vertebrate  and  invertebrate  predators, 
              including  the identification  of  source  regions  for  predator  populations
              which are off the Bank; and  2)  to  quantify  diet  and feeding rates based on
              stomach content analysis  and  gut  evacuation rates.  ***
