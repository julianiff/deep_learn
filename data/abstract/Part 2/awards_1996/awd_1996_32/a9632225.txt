Abstract    :
              This  project  develops methods to scale data mining tasks to large, inherently
              distributed databases. Meta-learning  computes  base  classifiers  by  applying
              learning  programs in parallel to database partitions, and then integrates them
              by another learning process outputting a `meta-classifier`.  Meta-learning  the
              correlations  of  the  base  classifiers  boosts  overall  predictive accuracy.
              Efficiency is achieved by parallel  processing  and  reduced  serial  time  per
              learning  process.  Meta-learning  is  scalable  by data reduction and parallel
              processing in hierarchical organizations.  We explore, analyze and  validate  a
               number  of  approaches  to  meta-learning,  and  deliver  demonstrable 
              systems allowing other researchers to directly utilize our results.  We 
              develop  field tests  of  the  resultant  technology  by  launching `learning
              agents` over the internet and combine their  collective  knowledge  by 
              `meta-learning  agents`. Many  defense  and  commercial  applications  will 
              benefit  from  learning new knowledge by integrating and analyzing very large
              amounts of widely distributed data. One organization working collaboratively on
              this project is the Financial Services Technology Consortium.  The FSTC has
              defined a  realistic  application  amenable  to  meta-learning  techniques  and
               are  providing  real datasets and learning tasks.  The project participants
              will demonstrate the efficacy of  the proposed  approach for fraud detection of
              electronic transactions in electronic commerce applications of the internet.
