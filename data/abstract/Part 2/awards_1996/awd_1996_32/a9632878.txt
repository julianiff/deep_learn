Abstract    :
                This award for dissertation research to Temple University will support an
              anthropology graduate student studying how local `community based
              organizations` provide social services to poor people in Philadelphia. 
              Focusing on three agencies, one dealing with low-income housing, one with
              health and educational programs, and one with AIDS victims, the project will
              study how local poor people are involved in the administration of the agencies
              and how their dependence on these bureaucratically-provided  services affects
              their local political activities.  The main hypothesis to be tested is that the
              more bureaucratically organized the agency the less politically active the
              population receiving services.  Using methods of participant observation,
              in-depth interviews of staff and clients, and a formal survey of both staff and
              clients, the student will provide an in-depth picture of the way these agencies
              impact the lives of the people they serve.  This research is important because
              it will provide a comparative, in-depth study of how poor people respond to
              political and economic change as mediated through the social service system. 
              In addition by supporting the training of a professional social scientist the
              grant will add to the nation's scientific capacity.
