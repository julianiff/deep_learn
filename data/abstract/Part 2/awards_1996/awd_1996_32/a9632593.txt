Abstract    :
                9632593 Bedzyk  This research project addresses critical aspects of
              heteroepitaxial growth of semiconductor structures including effects of strain,
              surfactants(growth related adsorbates including dopants), and alteration of
              surface kinetic phenomena through surfactant species.  The approach employs the
              x-ray standing wave(XSW) technique utilizing advanced light sources at national
              facilities along with more conventional surface science techniques at
              Northwestern to focus on the structure, adsorption, and transformation kinetics
              of growth-related species on the surface of a growing, strained heterolayer. 
              In-situ studies undertaken will center on the molecular beam epitaxy of
              elements from groups IV-IV on silicon and germanium substrates.  The high
              resolution XSW data will provide atomic positions within a strained overlayer
              with a precision of 0.01 Angstroms, and will be used as a stringent test of
              theoretical models and simulations. %%% The research will contribute basic
              materials science knowledge at a fundamental level of technological relevance
              to several aspects of advanced electronic/photonic devices and integrated
              circuitry.  Additionally, the knowledge and understanding gained from this
              research project is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the
              performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental
              understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and
              materials combinations.  An important feature of the program is the integration
              of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally
              and technologically significant area. ***
