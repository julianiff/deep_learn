Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  OPP-9632174  FITZHUGH    This project by the Smithsonian Institution's
              Arctic Studies Center is designed to present profiles of NSF-supported research
              projects on the Arctic Studies Center Web Site. The Smithsonian Institution is
              a major Web Site with thousands of "hits" per day. Since an important strategic
              goal of the National Science Foundation is scientific literacy, this linkage to
              the SI offers a unique opportunity for the Arctic Social Sciences Program. The
              web site team will be tasked with designing and operating an NSF Arctic Social
              Sciences graphic identity which will introduce a mission statement, a menu page
              for Arctic Social Science projects, reports and information, news and notables,
              hot links to other polar sites, and the NSF Home Page.
