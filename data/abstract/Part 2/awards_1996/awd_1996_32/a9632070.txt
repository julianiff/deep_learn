Abstract    :
              ***  9632070  Hutcheson     This STTR Phase I project will  investigate the
              possibility of developing a sub-micron characterization system using NMR, EPR,
              or ODNMR imaging. Optoelectronic devices require materials with controlled
              environments surrounding individual active ions.  The inability to achieve
              precise control lowers efficiency, creates damage sites, and reduces the
              overall reliability of the system.  Inhomogeneities which cause the
              environmental changes result from two sources; impurities and self
              contamination.  In many crystals this second factor is more significant than
              impurities. The work proposed in this project attempts to measure self
              contamination on a sub-micron basis. Crystals will also be grown to demonstrate
              control of this defect at the minimum levels possible.  Scientific Materials
              Corporation has the ability to generate process control to the near millisecond
              level which relates to crystal growth on the atomic level.  The techniques for
              evaluation of crystals are currently limited to the one micron scale.       
              The work proposed investigates the possibility of developing a sub-micron
              characterization system using NMR, EPR, or ODNMR imaging which in turn can be
              used for solid-state lasers, optical memories, holography, telecommunications,
              semiconductors, and nonlinear materials.    ***
