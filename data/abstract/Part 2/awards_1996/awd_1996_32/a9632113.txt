Abstract    :
              In 1994, Japan changed the electoral system used to choose members of the lower
              house of the Diet.  Single member districts replaced local multi-members
              districts.  Nine new regional proportional representation constituencies were
              also established.  Japan's first election under the new system will occur in
              1996.   This unique historical event provides a laboratory for the study of
              first-order effects of institutional change in a major industrial democracy.   
              Japan has long had a strong "personal vote" tradition which many believe
              resulted from the competition between candidates from the same party in
              multi-member districts.  Others believe the personal vote reflects political
              culture moreso than established electoral institutions.  By examining the
              party, candidate and voter behavior during the election, this project will
              determine if and how institutions matter.  The study will also investigate the
              effects of reform on attitudes toward democracy in Japan.  Much as in the
              American case, there exists a prevailing deep mistrust and apathy that affects
              whether people vote and how they make electoral choices.  Whether reform can
              make a difference in the way the Japanese relate to their government can be an
              important component of governmental stability in one of the world's most
              important democracies.
