Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     Peter Wiesner    Best Practices Forum:  Skills and Knowledge Assessment
              in                            Industry     Institute of Electrical and
              Electronic Engineers (IEEE)                           ENG-9632051    This
              proposal from the Institute of Electrical and  Electronic Engineers (IEEE),
              requests support to conduct a  workshop entitled Best Practices Forum:  Skills
              and  Knowledge Assessment in Industry.    The goal of this project is to shed
              light on skills  assessment by bringing together business organizations, 
              government entities, university and test-development  organizations to share
              their experiences.  The forum will be  a two day program in April 1996,
              implementing one of the  major recommendations made by the participants of
              Industry  2000 Workshop, which was funded by NSF and other  institutions.  The
              results of Industry 2000, documented in a  report and video,   have defined the
              involvement of the IEEE  in lifelong education and influence its constituents
              in  industry and higher education.    The participants of the proposed Best
              Practices Forum will  grapple with practical issues based on the experience of 
              fellow participants and their organizations. The forum will  focus on reviewing
              existing projects and on identifying a  meaningful, practical way to assess
              engineering skills.  By  focusing on skills assessment practices in industry,
              the  forum will serve as a resource for those charged with  planning and
              developing relevant undergraduate and graduate  curricula as well as
              industry-related research,  In addition  to providing a forum where ideas and
              resources can be  shared, Best Practices Forum will provide IEEE with an 
              opportunity to learn about industry needs first hand.
