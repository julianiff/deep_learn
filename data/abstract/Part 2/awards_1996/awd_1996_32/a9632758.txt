Abstract    :
              9632758  LYNCH    This project represents a continuation of a site-specific 
              biophysical modeling study of Georges Bank and the adjacent shelf  as part of
              the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Studies, Phase  2 program. The project
              will use the Dartmouth finite element  models to investigate water circulation
              and transport on Georges  Bank and adjacent shelf areas.  Individual-based
              models of early  life stages of fishes will incorporate the role of turbulence,
               stratification and feeding.  Retrospective studies of MARMAP and  GLOBEC data
              will also be conducted to examine shelf-wide and  interannual/decadal scales. 
              Modeling analysis of historical  zooplankton distributions will address the
              relative importance of  the Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf as sources of
              Georges Bank  populations.  A moored field component is included in this
              project  to measure the key inflows to the Georges Bank/Gulf of Maine  system.
              The investigations will be closely coordinated with the  proposed Canada GLOBEC
              studies on the Scotian Shelf.  ***
