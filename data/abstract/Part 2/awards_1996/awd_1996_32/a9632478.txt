              will:         1. Provide an on-line, standards-based interactive resource      
              bank of scielce performance assessments;       2. Provide a secure pool of
              assessment resources to be used       for accountability purposes;       3.
              Provide a mechanism for studying technical quality issues       related to
              reliability and generalizability; and       4. Permit the development of
              applications for other user       groups.    The planning grant will build a
              system that can house a library of  performance assessment tasks linked to
              national standards, rubrics,  scored student work, directions for tasks
              administration,  procedures for rater training and scoring, and directions for 
              gathering technical quality indicators.
