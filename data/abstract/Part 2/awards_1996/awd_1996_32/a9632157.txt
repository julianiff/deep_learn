Abstract    :
              Dr. Rebecca Conry, Department of Chemistry, University of Nevada, is   supported
              by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the Chemistry
              Division under a Research Planning Grant to prepare soluble   copper complexes
              that will act as homogeneous catalysts for the reduction   of carbon dioxide. 
              Three types of low-valent copper complexes including   Cu(I) hydrides, Cu(0)
              complexes, and heterobimetallic copper/zinc systems   will be investigated for
              their ability to reduce carbon dioxide.    Multi-electron reduction pathways
              will be a primary focus of this work.   These planning activities will advance
              Dr. Conry's career by providing a   basis for preparing a competitive NSF
              research proposal subsequent to the   completion of this Research Planning
              Grant.   Activation of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide is important because
              of   its implications for global warming. Three strategies for catalytically  
              reducing carbon dioxide are proposed which utilize copper in a variety of  
              oxidation states and coordination environments. Current industrial   processes
              which involve reactions with solid surfaces form the basis for   the compounds
              proposed.  The reactivity of the copper compounds will be   explored in
              homogeneous solution with the ultimate goal of converting   carbon dioxide into
              useful products.
