Abstract    :
              9632185  Riemer    The Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics (CAA) is the
              National  Research Council's (NRC) advisory body for astronomy and 
              astrophysics, both ground-and space-based.  The CAA is overseen  jointly by the
              Board on Physics and Astronomy (BPA) and the Space  Studies Board (SSB).  The
              CAA provides science policy  recommendations on astronomy and astrophysics
              issues to the  National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Aeronautics 
              and Space Administration (NASA), the Congress, the astronomy  community, and
              other organizations.  The activity is supported  jointly by the NSF and NASA
              (through the SSB's core support).  ***
