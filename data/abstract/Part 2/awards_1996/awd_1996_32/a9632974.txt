Abstract    :
              9632974  Ruggie  In the 1990s, American states adopted legislation to make it
              illegal to repeatedly follow or harass someone with the intent of bringing
              about emotional distress. These "stalking laws" were intended to prevent
              relatively harmless situations from escalating into violent confrontations. But
              many of the laws were problematic and a number of them were overturned by the
              courts. This dissertation addresses three questions. What factors determined
              whether or not a state adopted a stalking statute that was overly broad, overly
              narrow, or used language that was vague? What factors determined whether or not
              a state amended its law? In what ways could problems with the stalking
              legislation could have been prevented? Theoretically based hypotheses
              (diffusion, structural equivalence and interest group pressure theories) will
              be tested with data collected from state governments, the census, newspaper
              sources, and interest groups across the US. Analyses will attempt to determine
              what factors led each state to amend its law. Standard Regression techniques
              and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) will be used to analyze the data for
              the first two questions.  Answering the final question will involve an
              examination of the legislative history of the first anti-stalking law, passed
              in October 1990 by the state of California.   %%%%
