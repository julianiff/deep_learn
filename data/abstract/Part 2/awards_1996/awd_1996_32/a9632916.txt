Abstract    :
              This renewal project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry
              Program, focusses on fundamental studies of organized  media, including
              cyclodextrins, polymeric cyclodextrins and  dendrimers, for application in
              analytical separations with  particular focus on capillary electrophoresis.  A
              suite of  molecular spectroscopic techniques, including fluorescence, 
              absorbance, and circular dichroism, will be utilized in these  studies and will
              be complemented by stopped-flow kinetic methods.   During the tenure of this
              three year project, Professor Warner  and his students at Louisiana State
              University, with  collaborative input from Professor Robert Gooden of Southern 
              University - Baton Rouge, will pursue the objective of better  understanding
              organized media for use in separation science.  Organized media provide a
              second phase into which analytes can  move from aqueous solution.  This
              partitioning of analytes  between aqueous solution and the organized media has
              wide  application in the field of separation science.  The organized  media can
              serve as a pseudo-stationary phase and as a way of  imparting solubility to
              otherwise insoluble analytes in aqueous  solution.  In this project, organized
              media, particularly  cyclodextrins and dendrimers, will be synthesized and
              their  applicability in analytical separations of environmentally  significant
              analytes will be evaluated.
