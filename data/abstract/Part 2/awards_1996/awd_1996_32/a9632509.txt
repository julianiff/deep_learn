Abstract    :
              This project has four related objectives:  (1) identifying/developing, testing,
              and collecting  population data on multiple marker loci appropriate for use in
              the Human Genome Diversity  Project; (2) developing a global population
              database of such loci designed specifically to provide  a framework that can be
              built on by others, (3) testing the hypothesis of a European bias in the 
              ascertainment of markers and exploring the consequences for human population
              studies.    Twenty-three populations (of global distribution) will be typed for
              a large number of  polymorphisms (about 28) composing 8 compound loci, some of
              which will be specifically  ascertained to be free of the European Bias. 
              Nuclear DNA loci have been chosen for study  because of the unrestricted nature
              of the information they carry.  The populations have been  selected to provide
              a global distribution, but are also weighted toward over-representation of 
              Europe to allow thorough testing of objective 3.  The markers to be studied
              will be selected to be  PCR-based or converted as part of this project to a
              PCR-based typing format.  This will assure  that other investigators can
              readily test the same markers in other populations.  The resulting  database
              will be analyzed for heterozygosity, linkage disequilibrium, and genetic
              distance. By  the end of the study a global framework of the microevolution and
              diversity of Homo sapiens  will be in place, complete with a set of appropriate
              and thoroughly tested haplotype loci.
