Abstract    :
              9632230  Treiman    This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement research will examine
              the negotiations between the National Party of South Africa and the black
              opposition.  It will explore the factors that brought the National Party to the
              negotiating table and investigate the role of social movement insurgency and
              political parties in "making democracy."  The working hypotheses suggests that
              black insurgency forced the regime to consider negotiations, while the
              reorganization of the party and changes in its constituency made the
              negotiations possible.  This dissertation will challenge prevailing theoretical
              formulations in the literature on democratization which suggests that
              large-scale insurgency leads either to elite-aborted democratization, or
              revolution from below, both precursor to a reassertion of authoritarianism. 
              This seems to suggest that ordinary people can, and should, participate in
              democratizing states and that elite compromises can lead to win-win outcomes. 
              The researchers will gather data from both archival sources (state and National
              Party archives), in-depth elite interviews.  These will be further supplemented
              with information from newspapers, secondary literature and survey data.  ***
