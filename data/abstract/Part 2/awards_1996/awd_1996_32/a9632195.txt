Abstract    :
              9632195  FOWLER    This award will allow about 40 US psychologists, the majority
              of  them students or within eight years of their Ph.D., to travel to  the XXVI
              International Congress of Psychology in Montreal,   Quebec, Canada, August
              16-21, 1996.  This Congress is the  quadrennial meeting of the International
              Union of Psychological  Sciences (IUPsyS) of ICSU and is organized by the
              National  Research Council of Canada and the Canadian Psychological 
              Association.  It is the major opportunity for international  scientific
              exchange among the world's leading psychological  scientists; it will provide a
              forum for younger scholars to  interact with their counterparts and with
              leading scholars around  the world.  The American Psychological Association is
              working in  concert with the National Research Council of the US National 
              Academy of Sciences and its constituent US National Committee of  the IUPsyS in
              seeking and administering this grant.    ***
