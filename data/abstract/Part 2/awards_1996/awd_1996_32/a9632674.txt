Abstract    :
              9632674  Nerode    The objective is to support "Hybrid Systems and Autonomous 
              Control Workshop" (HSAC96), on Oct 12-14, 1996 in Ithaca, NY.  Hybrid systems
              are interacting networks of digital and continuous  systems.  Hybrid systems
              arise throughout business and industry  in such areas as interactive
              distributed simulation, traffic  control, plant process control, military
              command and control,  aircraft and robot design, and path planning.  The
              fundamental  problem of hybrid system is: given the performance specification 
              of one or a network of physical systems and a performance  specification for
              the system, extract digital control programs  which will force the network to
              obey its performance  specifications.  This rapidly developing area is at the
              interface  of control, engineering and computer science.  ***
