Abstract    :
              Yuichi Kitamura  University of Minnesota - Twin Cities  SBR-9632101    This
              research will investigate parametric likelihood methods.   Parametric
              likelihood methods are central to econometric and  statistical research.  In
              general, parametric methods involve the  use of rather arbitrary assumptions on
              the data generating  process.  This research will build on recent literature on
               nonparametric likelihood methods which extends the concept of  likelihood to
              models without distributional assumptions.   One of  the contributions of this
              research is to extend various empirical  likelihood methods to time series
              observations by treating the  dependence structure nonparametrically. 
              Extensive simulation  studies will be undertaken to examine the nature of these
              new  methods.  In addition, the project will investigate a new  criterion for
              model comparison, looking at various specifications  of dynamic asset pricing
              models.
