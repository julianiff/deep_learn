Abstract    :
              9632811  Anlarge  Our objective is to develop new methods of imaging microwave
              frequency magnetic fields and currents on micron length scales and
              sub-rf-period time scales in microwave devices.  These imaging techniques will
              open up a new microscopic understanding of microwave device properties. 
              Special attention will be given to superconducting microwave devices as they
              are now poised to make significant inroads into the cellular telephone and PCS
              markets.  The key limitations to this new technology, beside reliable cryogenic
              cooling, is the problem of  power dependence and nonlinearity of the devices. 
              Our imaging techniques will be specifically focused on the understanding and
              compensating for the microscopic origins of power dependence and nonlinearity
              in these devices.  The imaging techniques to be employed include scanning
              microwave microscopy, bolometric and non-bolometric scanning local energy
              deposition, and scanning SQUID microwave microscopy.  ***
