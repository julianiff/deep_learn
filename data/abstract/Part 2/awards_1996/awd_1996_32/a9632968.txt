Abstract    :
              9632968  Avallone     This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is being awarded
              for the testing and  deployment of a prototype instrument for detecting halogen
              oxides in the troposphere. An existing and proven instrument that has made
              measurements of chlorine monoxide and bromine monoxide in the stratosphere has
              been modified to perform under the higher total pressure and larger water vapor
              partial pressure conditions characteristic of the troposphere. Bromine species
              are believed to play a dominant role in the observed sudden depletions of ozone
              over the arctic region during springtime. Bromine monoxide has been detected in
              large abundance during these events. The PI will participate in the ARCTOC '96
              campaign which is being sponsored by the European Community during March-May
              1996. During this campaign, bromine monoxide will be measured using other
              techniques as well, thereby providing an opportunity to test the modified
              instrument. If this instrument works as anticipated, halogen oxide measurements
              will be provided with faster time response and lower detection limit than other
              techniques currently in use.
