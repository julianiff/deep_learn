Abstract    :
                The proposal is a request for support of a symposium "International Radiation
              Symposium: Current Problems in Atmospheric Radiation".  The symposium will
              provide a forum for multidisciplinary discussion of remote sensing and
              physical/natural science studies related to atmospheric radiation.  Ten
              science-discussion sessions are planned with participation from both
              international and US scientists expected.  An emphasis of the symposium will be
              discussiojn of phenomena and processes relevant to high-latitude research.  The
              symposium will bring together a large number of scientists studying a problem
              that is very important to the development of an upcoming research program,
              Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean.
