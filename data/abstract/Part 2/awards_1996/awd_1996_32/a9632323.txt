Abstract    :
              Magnetic field irregularities carried by the solar wind sweep charged particles
              out of the solar system and cause the anti-correlation between cosmic ray
              fluxes and the level of solar activity.  Since electrons and nuclei have
              greatly different charge/mass ratios, the relation of velocity and magnetic
              rigidity is significantly different for these two particle species.  If the
              heliospheric magnetic field has long range order, the charge sign of cosmic ray
              particles can affect their propagation.  Recent observations show that a major
              failure of current modulation models simultaneously reproducing electron and
              nucleon modulation is related to reversals of the solar magnetic field, which
              occur every eleven years.  Charge dependence, then, should change when the
              solar field reverses, but differently from that observed.    The PIs will
              conduct a research program extending measurements of charge dependence of
              cosmic ray solar modulation with a series of balloon flights to determine the
              time dependence of electron and positron fluxes over a broad energy range. 
              This investigation will determine the importance of large scale order of the
              heliospheric magnetic field in determining trajectories of charged particles in
              the heliosphere.
