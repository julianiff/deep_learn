Abstract    :
              9632348  BEARDSLEY  Phase  1  of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field
              Studies  -  Georges Bank Program supported two years (1994-1996) of physical 
              oceanographic  research  employing  moored  arrays  and  drifter  measurements.
              This project will support a three-year (1997-1999)  continuation of these
              measurements. Analyses will be focused  on  (a)  the  physical processes
              related to stratification,  forcing  (both surface and advective, e.g., a Slope
              Water intrusion)  and  spatial current structure, (b) the effects of
              insolation,  water  properties,  and mixing on biological parameters,  currents
               and  the   advection  patterns  of  the  zooplankton,  and  (c)   the 
              identification  of parameters for monitoring  and  making  model  predictions
              of the biological conditions on Georges Bank.  ***
