Abstract    :
              This award is a Research Planning Grant in the Organic Dynamics Program   of the
              Chemistry Division.  With these funds, Professor Frank Marã of    Florida
              Atlantic University will study fundamental aspects of the   structure-activity
              relationships of macromolecular assemblies. Small   peptides , typically of
              thirteen residues, will be prepared and their   stability and folding
              characteristics will be examined.  A minimalist   approach will provide
              information on strategies for design of novel   protein-based materials and
              modeling of folding events in proteins.   Structures will be studied using
              circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic   resonance.   Understanding of the
              basic aspects of dynamic behavior of biomolecules   requires the use of small
              model molecules, for which careful and exact   control of structure is
              realizable, to test structural hypotheses.  In   this study a series of 
              `designer helical peptides` serves this purpose   and the behavior of members
              of this series will help illuminate the   behavior of larger but related
              biologically important molecules.
