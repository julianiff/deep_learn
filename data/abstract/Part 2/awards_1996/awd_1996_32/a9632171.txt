Abstract    :
              9632171  Kurtz    This  Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry 
              (GOALI)  project  will  provide a close  University-Industry  interaction  with
               Hewlett-Packard  Laboratories  (HP)   and  faculty and graduate students at
              Louisiana State University.  The  research  will  focus  on mechanisms 
              underlying  giant  magnetoresistance   (GMR)  and  colossal   magnetoresistance
               (CMR).  These phenomena are of considerable interest in  the  context  of high
              density magnetic storage media.  The  films  will  be  prepared  at HP and
              characterization  at  the  LSU  Center  for  Advanced  Microstructures Devices 
              (CAMD).  The  CAMDE  synchrotron light source will be used  to  study  the 
              electronic   structure  and  Fermi  surface  properties   of  industrially 
              relevant materials. The  results  will  be  of  fundamental interest and should
              also lead to the development  of improved materials.  %%%  This  Grant
              Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry  (GOALI) research will develop
              a better understanding of  the  mechanisms  underlying magnetic and resistive
              properties  of  materials  used  magnetic storage media like  computer  hard 
              drives.    The    collaboration   involves   Hewlett-Packard  Laboratories
              (production of thin film hetero-structures) and  the   Louisiana  State 
              University's  Center  for   Advanced  Microstructures  and  Devices (CAMD)
              (film  characterization  using photoelectron spectroscopy). The materials of
              interest  include  giant magnetoresistive (GMR) hetero-structures  and 
              colossal magnetoresistive (CMR) perovskites.  ***
