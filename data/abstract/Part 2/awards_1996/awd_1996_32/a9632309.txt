Abstract    :
              Thomas Beck, University of Cincinnati, is funded by a grant from the  
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his work in   the
              use of multigrid methods for simulations of complex materials.  Beck   will
              continue his development of multigrid methods for solving the   Kohn-Sham
              equations of density functional theory and the Poisson   electrostatic
              equation.   New algorithms will be developed for use on   massively parallel
              computers such as the Cray T3D.  Once the methods have   been developed test
              computations will be carried out on small molecules   and periodic lattice
              systems for direct comparison with existing ab   initio and plane wave
              computations.   Applications include: 1)   calculations involving the chemical
              binding of sulfur compounds on gold   surfaces; and 2) Monte Carlo simulations
              to compute thermodynamic   information in hydrogen and hydrogen/helium plasmas
              at high pressures not   available to experiment.    Understanding chemical
              processes at the molecular level requires a   quantum treatment to accurately
              describe chemical bonds and   rearrangements occuring in complex condensed
              phase environments.    Existing algorithms for studying these processes have
              been limited both   by the inherent difficulties in such calculations and by
              the scaling   properties of the methods.  The multigrid methods being pursued
              by Beck   offer promising alternatives to more traditional electronic structure
                approaches due to their rigorous linear scaling capabilities and  
              computational flexibility.
