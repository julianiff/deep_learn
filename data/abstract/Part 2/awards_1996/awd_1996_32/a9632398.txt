Abstract    :
                This award supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              the University of Michigan.  The project is to study how the Colombian national
              state represents itself in relations with rural peasants through a linguistic
              analysis of videotaped encounters between the peasants and officials.  The
              particular organization studied will be an agrarian credit bank which makes
              loans to local farmers.  The analysis of conversations will reveal deep-seated
              expectations, assumptions and understandings of each side about the other. 
              Methods include a survey of 80 households eligible to apply for loans from the
              credit bank, and repeated long interviews with a sub-sample of 30 of the
              households to assess their understanding of the national level state. These
              interviews will provide context for an in-depth analysis of videotaped
              interactions between peasants and state officials, done in the credit bank,
              which will reveal the individual and social memories of the community as they
              form the image of the state..  This research is important because `the state`
              or the `government` is a cultural construction embedded in narratives and
              conversations (witness the news accounts in current US society about the
              government's dealings with local peoples).  This study will provide comparative
              information about how the state is culturally constructed in this Latin
              American context, which.will be valuable for comparisons and theory building
              about local perceptions of national issues.
