Abstract    :
              ***  9632181  Stewart   We propose to investigate and develop an imaging system
              based on ultra-wideband electric-field sensors. The proposed device will be
              based on a new optoelectronic design which is capable of timedomain
              far-infrared spectroscopy across a frequency range extending from near DC to
              several THz. Fundamentally, the electric-field sensor system is based on the
              linear electro-optic effect (Pockel's effect) in electro-optic crystals where a
              pulsed microwave signal acts as a transient bias to induce a transient
              polarization in the sensor crystal. This polarization is then probed by a
              synchronously pulsed laser beam, and the spatial and temporal electric-field
              distribution is projected onto a CCD camera by the laser. Our previous studies
              of these imaging sensors has demonstrated a sub-wavelength spatial resolution,
              femtosecond temporal resolution, near DC-THz bandwidth, sub-mV/cm field
              sensitivity, up to 100 Hz scan rate, and a signal-to-noise ratio better than
              10,000:1. The electro-optic detection has a flat (nonresonant) spectral
              responsivity (from near DC to several THz), a large detector area (> 1 cm2),
              and an extended dynamic range (> 1,000,000). The simplicity of the detection
              geometry, capability for optical parallel processing, and excellent
              signal-to-noise ratio make this system suitable for real-time, 2-D coherent far
              infrared imaging applications.    ***
