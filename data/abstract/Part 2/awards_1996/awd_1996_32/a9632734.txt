Abstract    :
              If politics makes a difference in parliamentary democracies, then the promises
              political parties make during electoral campaigns should have a systematic
              impact on their subsequent policy making in office.  Existing studies of
              parliamentary politics have failed to provide an adequate explanation of
              whether and to what degree this connection exists. This research will extend
              the scope of narrowly constructed models of coalition bargaining to all stages
              of policy making activity in the legislature and shift the theoretical focus of
              traditional analysis of comparative legislative behavior toward promising
              questions such as why parties behave as they do.  The project will advance the
              empirical state of knowledge in comparative legislatures through the systematic
              collection of data across the parliamentary democracies of France, Germany,
              Ireland, and The Netherlands.  Data collection will require year-long field
              research examining legislative proceedings.  Econometric methods will be used
              to model the complex relationships that theory suggests should characterize
              legislative bargaining.
