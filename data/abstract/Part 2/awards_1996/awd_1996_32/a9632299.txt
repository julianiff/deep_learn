Abstract    :
              9632299  Tayebati      This Phase I STTR project will produce efficient
              Strontium Barium Niobate (SBN) thin films based devices and components.
              Currently available nonlinear materials such as LiNbO3 (lithium niobate), 
              BaTiO3 (barium titanate) and PLZT (lead (lanthanum) titanate-zirconate) do not
              have the necessary physical constants to make efficient devices in terms of
              power consumption and driving voltages required for operations. SBN provides a
              material with extremely large electro-optic coefficient (1380pm/V for SBN:75
              compared to 30 pm/V for LiNbO3) that can greatly improve the performance of
              existing nonlinear optical devices and components.     Growth of highly
              electro-optic nonlinear materials can provide the key for enabling the
              production of efficient optical components such as tunable filters and
              modulators for optical communications. In addition, these devices can be used
              as a building block for systems including optical sensors, and interferometers.
