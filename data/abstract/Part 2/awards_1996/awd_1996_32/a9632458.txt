Abstract    :
              This award provides renewed support for the Natural Hazards Research and
              Applications Information Center.  The Center's basic function is to serve as a
              bridge between the hazards research and practitioner communities in the United
              States.  The Center monitors and disseminates hazards research information to
              multiple users: administrators, practitioners, policy makers, engineers, and
              scientists.  The Center publishes and distributes the Natural Hazards Observer
              to over 13,300 subscribers six times a year; operates an electronic newsletter,
               Disaster Research; and disseminates information via the World Wide Web and
              traditional hard copy publications.  It holds an annual workshop involving
              users and producers of hazards research, and it provides information on a
              day-to-day basis in response to inquiries.  The Center conducts research
              activities relating to societal response to natural hazards and it supports
              researchers throughout the nation as they carry out `quick response` studies of
              specific hazard events.  In addition to NSF, other agencies providing support
              for this activity include FEMA, USGS, USDA, NOAA,  DOT, and the Corps of
              Engineers.
