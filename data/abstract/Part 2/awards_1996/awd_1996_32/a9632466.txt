Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:  CTS-9632466  Principle investigator:  Wang    
              This project is aimed at developing a fundamental understanding of the melt
              fracture and flow instability phenomena of linear polyethylene resins. 
              Specifically, experiments are proposed to unravel the molecular origin of spurt
              flow behavior and sharkskin formation.  Experiments will be conducted under
              both controlled piston speed and constant pressure conditions.  Geometry and
              surface dependent phenomena will be studied.  The unique feature of the
              investigation is that the subject of melt flow instability and extrudate
              fraction involves a highly non-linear coupling between bulk constitutive
              properties and hydrodynamic boundary conditions at melt/wall and melt/melt
              interfaces.  The proposed effort goes beyond the continuum approach and will
              attempt to link with micro-molecular physics.  The results of this research
              will have wide applicability in the polymer processing industry.
