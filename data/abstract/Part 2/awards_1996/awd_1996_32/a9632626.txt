Abstract    :
              9632626  Douglas    The principal goals of this project is to remove barriers
              that  inhibit research competitiveness in Bridge Engineering so that the 
              University of Nevada, Reno may fully develop as a national research  center.
              The project will conduct unique research in the area of  seismic simulation
              studies on its shaking table facility which will  become operational in fall
              1996.  When the facility opens, the  university will have two 14-ft by 14-ft
              shaking tables with 50 tons  of capacity each and the largest payload capacity
              in the United  States.  Non-federal support of the Bridge Engineering
              initiative  from the user community has been obtained in the form of letters of
               commitment for matching support in the aggregate amount of $750,000  per year
              from NDOT and CALTRANS.  The project's overall goal is to  further expand this
              into a consortium of Western States interested  in supporting seismic research.
