Abstract    :
              9632841  CONVERSI      This project is part of the U.S. GLOBEC Nortwest Atlantic
              Field  Studies, Phase 2 program. The project focuses on intercomparisons  of
              interannual patterns in zooplankton and phytoplankton species,  in relation to
              climatic changes. The specific objectives of this  project are:  1) to study
              the decadal changes in the abundance of  the dominant, pan-Atlantic copepod
              species (Calanus finmarchicus,  Pseudocalanus spp., Centropages typicus,
              Centropages hamatus,  Metridia lucens, Acartia clausi and Temora longicornis)
              in the  northeastern U.S. shelf (including Gulf of Maine and Georges  Bank); 
              2) to compare zooplankton variability in the western and  eastern Atlantic
              (area around the British Isles, including the  North Sea); and 3) to relate the
              information from across-Atlantic  comparisons to decadal changes in climate
              variables.  ***
