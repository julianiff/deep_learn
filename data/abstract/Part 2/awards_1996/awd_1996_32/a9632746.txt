Abstract    :
              9632746  WISHNER    Episodic, advective features may play a major role in the
              input  and loss of zooplankton and larval fish populations on Georges  Bank.
              However, the importance of these mesoscale events has not  been quantified
              directly and may be strongly time-and feature-  dependent. The impact is likely
              to vary with the type of feature  and its location, season, and magnitude, all
              of which will affect  the species, abundance, and developmental stages of
              zooplanton and  fish larvae in the feature itself and on the Bank. As part of
              the  U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Studies, Phase 2 program,  this
              project will determine the association of particular  zooplankton species with
              selected episodic features of opportunity  (such as Scotian shelf streamers,
              slope or shelf water parcels, or  warm-core rings) and ascertain how the
              vertical migrations of  zooplankton interact with the flow fields to affect the
              flux of  zooplankton in these features.  ***
