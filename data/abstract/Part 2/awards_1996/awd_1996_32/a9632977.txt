Abstract    :
              This is a project to develop and extend support for multithreaded computation on
               superscalar processors.  The intention is to provide high processor
              utilization  despite increasing memory latency.  In simultaneous
              multithreading, multiple  independent threads will issue instructions to a
              superscalar processor's  functional units in a single cycle.  The objective of
              this project is to fully  define the low-level architecture for simultaneous
              multithreading, including  scheduling, register architecture, pipeline design,
              and speculative execution.   The project is developing compiler and operating
              systems support for  multithreaded execution on the new processor architecture.
               A primary goal is to  maximize multiple thread performance without increasing
              single thread latency.   Most measurements are from detailed simulations, using
              simulators and compilers  provided by industrial partners.
