Abstract    :
              This award is a Research Planning Grant in the Organic Dynamics Program   of the
              Chemistry Division.  With these funds, Professor Kimberley Waldron   of  Regis
              University will study green fluorescent protein from the   organism Aequorea. 
              This protein is believed to fluoresce as a result of   intramolecular
              cyclization of sequential amino acids.  The fully   fluorescent protein can be
              expressed in a wide variety of cell types and   as a consequence is of active
              interest in the cell and developmental   biology communities.  This work will
              use fluorescence and Fourier   transform infrared spectroscopies,
              spectroelectrochemistry, and molecular   modeling to characterize the
              fluorophore/electrophore and to probe   three-dimensional interactions. 
              Standard molecular biological techniques   will be used to create native and
              mutant protein.   Were science able to insert a characteristic fluorescent
              group into   arbitrary proteins a powerful general analytical tool for study
              and   identification of such molecules would result.  The significance of  
              achieving such a goal is manifold, since many biotechnological   applications
              currently use fluorescence technology. This work will begin   the
              characterization of a specific fluorescent segment of a protein that   holds
              substantial promise for meeting this goal.
