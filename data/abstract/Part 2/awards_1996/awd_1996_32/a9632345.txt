Abstract    :
              It is proposed to develop a simple and clear language for use as a digital 
              interface in Solid Free-Form Fabrication.  This language is called "SIF" for 
              "Solid Interchange Format" inspired by CIF, the Caltech Intermediate Form for
              LSI  layout description.  The role of SIF would be to describe the ideal solid
              part  desired, in a fabrication-process-independent way.  It is further
              proposed to create a foundation for some of the key tools needed  with such an
              exchange language, in particular, a robust slicing tool to create  2.5D layers
              needed for process planning, as well as checker programs that will  verify that
              the shape specified in the SIF file is indeed a closed solid, has the  required
              topological and geometric properties, and specifies only realizable  features
              containing certain minimum feature sizes and separations.    Finally, it is
              proposed to develop test structures of various kinds that will  test the
              robustness of analysis and conversion tools working from SIF input for 
              different SFF fabrication processes and to monitor the quality of individual 
              production runs.
