Abstract    :
              9632540  DAVIS  As part of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Studies
              Phase  2 program, a modeling effort will investigate how physical  processes
              interact with population dynamics to control the  distributions of dominant
              copepod species (Calanus finmarchicus,  Pseudocalanus newmani and P. moultoni,
              Centropages typicus, and  Centropages hamatus) in the Georges Bank/Gulf of
              Maine region. The  study will provide: 1) new insights into the functioning of
              a  mesopelagic component of a pelagic ecosystem, 2) novel information  on the
              dynamics of the prey field of larval fish, and 3) basic  data on the potential
              effects that climate change can exert on  species distributions in temperate
              shelf areas.  ***
