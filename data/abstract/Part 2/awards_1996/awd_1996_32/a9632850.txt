Abstract    :
              This award supports a two day workshop held in September 1996 at Harvard to
              explore the policies and planning required to continue the viability of the
              Internet.  Participants include key individuals and organizations within and
              beyond the Internet community, from the U.S. and foreign countries.  Papers
              presented at the conference are on the Harvard web server and published in a
              book from the MIT Press.
