Abstract    :
              Subduction zones and island arcs are regions of material flux to  and from the
              mantle.  Knowledge of the magnitude of these fluxes  has a major bearing on
              understanding the evolution of the Earth.   In the Mediterranean, the approach
              of Africa towards Europe appears  to have resulted in the subduction of large
              amounts of sediment in  the last few million years.  Subducted sediment should
              affect the  amount and chemistry of volcanism in the arc behind the subduction 
              zone and the PI wishes to examine this model by analyzing ashes  that were
              collected in cores in the Mediterranean that date back 5  million years.
