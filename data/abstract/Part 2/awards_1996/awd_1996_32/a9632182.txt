Abstract    :
              9632182  Thorpe  The mechanical stability and associated properties of network 
              glasses can be analyzed by studying the floppy modes, the low  frequency
              eigenmodes.  Using a recently devised algorithm, called  the pebble game, in
              two dimensions, the PI has been successful in  calculating several measures of
              the cluster statistics for a  large number of sites.  The current grant is to
              explore extension  of this work to 3 dimensions, to explore development of an 
              associated  thermodynamic formalism and thereby study floppy-  rigid
              transitions.  This research should produce an improved  understanding of
              hardness, the structural behavior of tunneling  modes and the nature of fragile
              and strong glass formers.  %%%  This grant supports research in the mechanical
              stability of  glasses.  The research involves  developments of measures of 
              strength and mathematical techniques for a reliable calculation  of them.  The
              various projects here are at the forefront of the  interface between applied
              mathematics and materials science. This  research should produce an improved
              understanding of hardness,  of its relationship to elastic waves and the nature
              of fragile  and strong glass formers.  ***
