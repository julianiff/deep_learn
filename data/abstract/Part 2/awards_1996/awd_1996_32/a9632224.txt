Abstract    :
              Lyne  AST 96-32224    This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) supports 
              the theoretical investigation of the break-up of meteoroids  upon entry into
              the terrestrial atmosphere.  The work will  improve on several of the
              simplifying assumptions made in  the past in atmospheric entry physics, such as
              material  ablation and  the associated energy transfers; the effects of shock
              layer  shapes, densities, and pressures; the problems that arise  from hyper
              velocities (i.e., velocities in excess of about  10 km/sec); and the problem of
               mechanical bolide fragmentation.    The Principal Investigator has unique
              practical  qualifications for this research.  He has been a test  engineer at
              the hypersonic wind tunnels of the Air Force's  Arnold Engineering Development
              Center (1984-85) and he has  worked on atmospheric entry of manned spacecraft
              on Earth  and Mars at NASA's  Ames Research Center (1992).  For the past two
              years, he has  redirected his practical experience to the theoretical and 
              computational investigations of terrestrial meteor entries.
