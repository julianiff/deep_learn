Abstract    :
              9632596  DAVIS  A major goal of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Studies
               Phase 2, Georges Bank Program is to examine the immigration and  emigration
              (source, retention, and loss) of target species from  the Bank. Toward this
              end, a field study is proposed in which  focused high-resolution sampling will
              be conducted with the Video  Plankton Recorder (VPR) to quantify average and
              episodic transport  processes that move the copepods Calanus and Pseudocalanus
              across  the boundaries of the Bank during the spring development of these 
              populations.  The major circulation processes to be studied  include: 1) the
              inflow or source of copepods along the northern  edge of the bank; 2) the
              degree of closure of the gyre and  retention of copepods, and 3) the losses of
              copepods, due to mean  along-shelf flow to the west as well as detrainment of
              bank  copepods to the south by eddies and warm-core rings. This project  will
              be carried out collaboratively with the Brink et al.  SeaSoar/(VPR) study
              (9632349).  ***
