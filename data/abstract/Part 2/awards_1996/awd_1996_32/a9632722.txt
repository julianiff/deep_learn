                                  University of Colorado, IUCRC- CSTF  EEC-9632722    Abstract
                 This  award constitutes a five year renewal of the Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Separations Using Thin Films (CSTF) at
              the University of Colorado.  The objectives of the CSTF include: (1) to conduct
              basic research and related developmental activities for the use of thin film
              technology in separation processes, (2) to provide rapid technology transfer
              between Center reset projects and industrial participants, and (3) to provide a
              graduate student education focus in this technology area.  The Center research
              program is based on: (1) reversible chemical complexation, (2) membrane
              structure and performance, (3) catalytic membrane reactions, and (4) membrane
              fouling.  The Center collaborates I/UCRCs at University of Tennessee and
              University of Washington through two tie projects.  Presently 12 companies and
              national laboratories participate in the Center as sponsors.  They pay an
              annual fee of $40,000, participate in the Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) which
              reviews the research progress, recommends termination and initiation of
              projects, provides industrial mentors to individual projects, and facilitates
              technology transfer.
