Abstract    :
              9632203  Heim  This research project is part of a dissertation in economic
              history on the creation of property rights in the radio spectrum in the United
              States between 1897 and 1927. Archival research in government documents
              collections, the Smithsonian Archives, and archives of private firms will be
              used to construct a case study of this process. The case study will include an
              account of the activities of major parties involved in the creation of property
              rights in the spectrum. This research will also provide data on product
              markets, technology, resource characteristics, existing institutions, and
              ideological factors affecting the creation of property rights. This empirical
              case study then will be used to shed light on theoretical issues at the
              frontiers of economics involving the creation of property rights institutions.
              In particular, this case study will allow a focus on the role of the economic
              and political power of varied actors involved in the creation of a mixture of
              public and private property rights in a resource. Finally, the dissertation
              will relate the theoretical insights about institutions and property rights
              that emerge from the case study to the development of new communications
              technologies and systems today.  %%%%
