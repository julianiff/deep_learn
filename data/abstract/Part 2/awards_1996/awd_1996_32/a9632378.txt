Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT     The proposed work will address thermal and mass transport phenomena
              occurring during freezing of multicellular tissues.  The solidification process
              and tissue transport properties will be studied experimentally by using both a
              directional gradient solidification stage and an isothermal cryogenic perfusion
              microscope stage.  Transient finite-element analyses will be performed to study
              the interaction of the global thermal fields and the interface morphology
              fields take place at a length scale several orders of magnitude smaller than
              the thermal field.  The unique approach of combining experimental and
              computational investigations at the microscale and macroscale transport has a
              good potential to improve the fundamental understanding of freezing in
              multicellular tissues and lead to better processing protocols for
              cryopreservation of tissues and cryosurgery.
