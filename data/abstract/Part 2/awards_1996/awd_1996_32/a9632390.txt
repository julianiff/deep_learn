Abstract    :
              9632390  Raman        The meteorology over the Western Pacific Ocean is not
              well-known, but has  a great influence on the global climate.  A field program
              named the Tropical Ocean  Global Atmosphere, Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response
              Experiment (TOGA  COARE) had as one of its objectives to increase understanding
              of the characteristics  of mesoscale convective systems  (MCS) over the Western
              Pacific.  Of special  interest is the potential for MCSs to significantly
              modify air-sea momentum, heat  and moisture fluxes over a large area relative
              to that of an individual cumulonimbus  cloud.         The Principal
              Investigator will investigate and quantitatively describe the  interactions
              between MCSs and the ocean mixed layer in the Western Pacific warm  pool (WPWP)
              using a nested-grid, coupled ocean-atmosphere mesoscale model.   Specific
              objectives include:  (i) improve understanding of the effect of the WPWP  on
              the equilibrium and transient structures of the marine atmospheric boundary 
              layer;  (ii) identify and quantify the feedback effect of wind, air temperature
              and  precipitation associated with MCSs over the warm pool on the horizontal
              and  vertical density distributions of the ocean mixed-layer, and on the
              air-sea heat and  moisture fluxes;  (iii) identify and quantify the feedback
              effect of changes in air-sea  heat and moisture fluxes, sea surface temperature
               and sea surface temperature  gradients due to convective and mesoscale
              processes on subsequent development of  convective and mesoscale events;  (iv)
              assimilate important parameters in the  atmospheric and oceanic boundary-layers
              using a coupled mesoscale model.        Successful completion of this research
              will assist in improving knowledge of  the impact of MCS on planetary scale
              events such as El Nino.  ***
