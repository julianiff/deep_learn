Abstract    :
              9632148  Tatum  Both majority and minority scholars have argued for the
              incorporation of minority perspectives into criminological literacy and the
              study of crime. This research will assess the utility of the criminological
              literature of African-American scholars for mainstream theorizing and helping
              to frame testable hypotheses of crime causation. After identifying and
              describing theories and perspectives advanced by African-American scholars, the
              research will use content analysis to: (1) analyze underlying assumptions; (2)
              analyze the conceptualization and use of core theoretical variables; (3)
              identify literature that may be classified as African-American criminology" and
              describe the boundaries of this theoretical knowledge; and (4) assess what
              these theories and perspectives add to mainstream criminology and the study of
              crime and violence.  The identification and analysis of this literature can
              further lead to the empirical testing of minority theories, the revision of
              mainstream theories and the creation of new theories and paradigms.  %%%%
