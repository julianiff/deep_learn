Abstract    :
              Dr.  Darryl Williams, Department of Chemistry, Wayne State University, is  
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the
              Chemistry Division under a Research Planning Grant to develop high   oxidation
              state organometallic compounds as chromophores.  Compounds   containing
              tantalum and tungsten bound to nitrido, alkylidyne, imido,   oxo, and
              cyclopentadienyl ligands will be synthesized, and the reactivity   of their
              electronic excited states will be explored.  The goal is to   examine the
              factors which determine the strength of the metal-ligand   multiple bond and
              the relationship of absorption and emission data to   this interaction. 
              Ultimately, this informaton will be used to control   and design luminescent
              compounds using these linkages. These planning   activities will advance Dr.
              William's career by providing a basis for   preparing a competitive NSF
              research proposal subsequent to the   completion of this Research Planning
              Grant.   Compounds containing the metals tantalum and tungsten will be prepared
              in   which multiple bonds can be formed to oxygen, nitrogen and carbon atoms.  
               These compounds have luminescent properties which can be manipulated by   the
              substituents bound to the metal and to the multiply bonded atoms.     The
              electronic structure and excited state reactivities of a series of   these
              compounds will be investigated.  The potential advantage of these   systems
              over those currently available is a higher degree of control over   the
              luminescent properties.
