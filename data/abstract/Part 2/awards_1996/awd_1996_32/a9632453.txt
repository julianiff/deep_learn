Abstract    :
              9632453  Nader  Following Brazil's transition to democracy in 1984, the state's
              emphasis on citizenship and universalistic rights has led to policies seeking
              to modernize courtroom procedure and access. One result of these policies has
              been a federal mandate ordering the establishment of special small claims
              courts. States have established small claims courts which vary dramatically in
              their constitution and procedure.  This research is a comparative ethnographic
              investigation of two urban Brazilian small claims courts that explores the
              relationship among civic discussions of rights and citizenship, adjudication,
              and judicial reform in Brazil. Specifically, the study examines the linkages
              between judicial deformalization in small claims court procedure and Brazilian
              conceptions of citizenship and rights. The two small claims courts chosen for
              the project differ considerably. One as not undergone procedural
              deformalization whereas the other has. The first phase of the project will
              begin with archival research specifically focusing on case records, political
              speeches, newspaper and journal articles, and the publications of local legal
              organizations. The goal of this phase of the research is to look for trends in
              litigation and establish the social domain of rights and citizenship discourse.
              The second phase will consist of courtroom observation and interviews with
              litigants, state officials, courtroom staff, administrators, and local legal
              agencies.  This phase of the research is designed to document instances of
              citizenship and rights in practice and elicit ethnographic accounts of these
              social ideals. %%%%
