Abstract    :
              CTS-9632847  Timothy Barbari  Johns Hopkins University    ABSTRACT     The 1996
              International Congress on Membranes and Membrane Processes (ICOM '96) will take
              place in Yokohama, Japan from August 18-23, 1996.  ICOM '96 is sponsored by the
              Membrane Society of Japan and co-sponsored by the North American Membrane
              Society and the European Society of Membrane Science and Technology.  The 1996
              ICOM will focus on both synthetic and biological membranes in the hope that the
              exchange of information between these two fields will contribute to innovative
              and exciting membrane technologies in the future.  Specific topics include
              multi-phase transport phenomena, hydrodynamics, reverse osmosis,
              nanofiltration, ultrafiltration and microfiltration, gas separation,
              pervaporation and vapor permeation, inorganic membranes, electro-membranes,
              liquid membranes, vesicles and microcapsules, biological and biomimetic
              membranes, membrane reactors, food processing and environmental  applications. 
              This grant will provide partial support of the expenses of about 15
              participants.  The United States academic community has long played a key role
              in membrane research.  Interactions with international colleagues will help the
              American membrane researchers to maintain a leadership role in the field.  This
              meeting could help to make the U.S. membrane industry more competitive globally
              and to handle environmental and biotechnological applications more effectively.
