Abstract    :
              9632029  Pisias    This award supports a collaborative effort that will test 
              hypotheses regarding the occurrence of millennial-scale climate  fluctuations
              now recognized in western North America and the  northeastern Pacific Ocean. 
              Preliminary data from marine sediments  off California and Oregon, pollen
              records from Pacific Northwest  lakes, and glacial records from western North
              America reveal  climate events that appear to be related to the Heinrich events
              of  the North Atlantic.  This study will test two hypotheses:  1)  that 
              climate events originating in the North Atlantic are transmitted to  the North
              Pacific ocean and western North America via thermohaline  circulation and its
              influence on properties of the surface ocean  and circulation of the
              atmosphere, and 2) that climates of the  North Atlantic, North America, and the
              northeast Pacific depend  jointly on the elevation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet
              and its  influence on atmospheric circulation.  These hypotheses will be 
              constrained by analyzing the paleoclimate record in a geographic  array of
              sites in the northeastern Pacific Ocean and in western  North America,
              including constraints on oceanic upwelling and near-  surface advection, deep
              ocean properties and vegetation on land,  and comparing these data with model
              output.  A significant advance  will come from linking the records from land
              and sea with a well-  constrained chronology, and with stratigraphic links of
              pollen and  terrigenous sediment in marine cores.
