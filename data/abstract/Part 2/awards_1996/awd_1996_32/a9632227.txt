Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS-9632227  A. Sangani, Syracuse U.    The objective is to better
              describe the macroscopic behavior of two-phase flow systems by studying
              phenomena at the particle, bubble, or other microstructural length scale of the
              disperse phase, by using a combination of theoretical and computational
              methods.  The effect of particle Stokes number and phase concentration in flows
              where both inertial and viscous effects are significant will be investigated. 
              Numerical simulations will be used to evaluate velocity fluctuations in
              two-phase flow and to analyze the flow stability.  The Reynolds stress, eddy
              viscosity, and eddy diffusivity will be numerically simulated and eventually
              modeled.  A computational technique, in which the Stokes flow interactions are
              computed by dividing the particles into groups of varying sizes and combining
              the fields induced by the particles within each group by the method of multiple
              expansion, will be carried out for suspensionq containing 1-10 thousand
              particles per cell.      The proposed project, if successful, will provide
              improved basic understanding and numerical simulation tools for gas-solid
              flows, bubbly flows and composite materials deformation, of relevance in
              numerous processing industries and natural phenomena.  ***
