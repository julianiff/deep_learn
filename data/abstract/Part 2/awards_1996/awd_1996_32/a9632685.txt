Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9632685    The proposed project is to investigate condensation in
              micro grooves that are 5 to 500 mm wide.  Prior studies have shown that when
              micro grooves with such small dimensions are involved, the condensation rate
              could not be completely explained by models which only take into account
              gravitational and capillary forces.  The proposed work is to incorporate
              interfacial forces in a model and conduct heat transfer experiments to
              determine the individual roles of gravitational, surface tension, and
              interfacial forces, and verify the model.  By using micro grooves of different
              widths and apex angles, the dominance of the different forces could be
              revealed.  The working fluids to be used are ultra-pure water and methanol.
