Abstract    :
              We seek to marry rate-distortion theory with perceptual science in order to 
              develop improvements in fidelity criteria and techniques for the  compression
              of video and other natural data sources.    The information theory of
              Weber-Fechner (WF) and root law (RL) fidelity  criteria will be studied, with
              emphasis on their application to lossy  compression of video signals and on
              calculating lower bounds to their  rate-distortion functions. Multiterminal
              source coding models will be  employed to deal with perceptual considerations,
              such as  just-noticeable-differences and masking, that arise when sequences of
              video  frames are viewed.    Also, we shall explore novel video compression
              schemes grounded in WF/RL  theory that provide dramatic computational
              simplifications relative to  competing  algorithms at high data rates and
              promise better quality in the  low-bit-rate regime for such appications as
              video telephony and distance  learning.  Low-latency video compression and
              transport will be performed on  facilities in the DISCOVER Lab to test our
              perceptually based algorithms.
