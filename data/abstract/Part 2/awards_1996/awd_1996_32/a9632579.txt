              ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:   CTS-9632579    Principal Investigator:  Marcus   
              The goal of this work is the destabilization of trailing tip vortices from
              commercial aircraft.  This is a persistent problem that was identified more
              than thirty years ago.  The strength of these vortices is so large that even
              another commercial jet can be upset if encountering a vortex structure at too
              close a range.  A rash of crashes in the 60's and 70's required the FAA to set
              stringent spacing standards for landing aircraft that has had a severe impact
              on the capacity of our airports.  Over the years there has been an intense
              effort directed at finding methods for breaking up these very coherent vortex
              structures, mainly through modifications to to the wing and its control
              surfaces.  None of this work has lead to anything of practical use.  In this
              study, wake vortices are weakly modified by injecting small amount of fluid at
              the wing tips in a precisely controlled manner.  A novel semi-analytical method
              utilizing degenerate perturbation theory will be used to explore a broad range
              of combinations of angle, location, spatial structure and temporal rate of the
              injected fluid that leads to fast-growing short wave length instabilities.  One
              effect of the fast-growing short wave length instabilities is to increase the
              core size quickly,  which reduces the intensity of the swirl velocity.  A
              secondary, and perhaps more important effect of increase core size is enhanced
              role that the Crow instability mechanism can play in the final decay of the
              trailing vortex system.
