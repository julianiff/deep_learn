               Change: Lake Issyk-Kul, Kyrgyzstan, Central Asia    Lake Issyk-Kui in the
              former Soviet Republic of Kyrgyzstan is the  fifth deepest lake in the world
              (668 meters).  Issyk-Kul is located  1600m above sea level in the Asian
              landmass, and is positioned  between the winter Siberian High and the summer
              Southwest Indian  Low-even subtle changes in moisture and/or temperature regime
              due  to climate shifts in the position or intensity of these major  atmospheric
              elements should effect changes in lake-level Issyk-Kul  is a closed-basin lake
              with abundant carbonate sediments and a rich  natural history of large-scale,
              and ongoing lake-level change.   Modern lake level has fallen 3 meters in the
              last 70 years and  evidence suggests even larger oscillations long before any
              possible  human intervention.  Preliminary fieldwork revealed that paleo- 
              shorelines are recorded in coastal hardgrounds of inorganic and  microbialitic
              origin- these provide a dateable proxy for Late  Holocene lake level positions.
               This award supports a investigation  of: (1) nearshore carbonates and Late
              Holocene beach deposits, and  (2) the deep-basin sedimentary and
              paleolimnological record.   Paleoenivronmental significance of the relic
              microbialites will be  established through modern analogues.  Origin, growth,
              and recent  environmental history of the living and relic microbialites will be
               established through petrographic techniques, mineralogic analysis  of cements
              to detect salinity shifts, and preliminary stable  isotopes analysis of calcite
              cements to assess their utility as  proxies for hydrologic regime.
