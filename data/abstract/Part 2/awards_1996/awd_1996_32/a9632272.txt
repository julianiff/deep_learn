Abstract    :
              An exploding demand for information services is pushing databases toward
              specialized  and often incompatible approaches. Yet, the best solutions to the
              formidable technical challenges of each sub-field are often found in the
              convergence of techniques and   models from different approaches.  For
              instance, advanced active database systems support rule activation by complex
              temporal events, while complex patterns of temporal events have been the focus
              of languages for  time-series analysis and temporal queries. Significant
              benefits are expected   from  the confluence of these areas of research. 
              Moreover, the capability of reasoning  with time is critical to model the
              dynamics of active databases, and to avoid undesirable rule behavior, such as
              non-termination. This project pursues a unified approach to the  design and 
              query optimization  of languages for time-series analysis, temporal reasoning
              on databases, and active rules  with  composite events.  In  addition, the
              project  is developing more effective temporal semantics for active database
              rules, and providing  methods and tools to predict and control their behavior. 
              This research will provide capabilities for a wide range of government and
              industrial applications that must reason with and manage temporal data.
