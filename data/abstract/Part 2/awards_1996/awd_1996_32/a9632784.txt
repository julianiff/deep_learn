Abstract    :
              9632784  FAIRBANKS  Circulation of water over Georges Bank can be described by
              two  modes: (1) the canonical mode, that is an anticyclonic gyre with  source
              waters originating in the coastal Gulf of Maine; (2) the  "shunt mode" that is
              characterized by direct injection of Scotian  Shelf Water across the Northeast
              Channel onto the south flank of  Georges Bank. The primary objective of this
              study is to assess the  amount of biological variance explained by these two
              circulation  modes. The project will use the oxygen isotope tracer oxygen-18 of
               the water to separate local and upstream freshwater sources and to 
              quantitatively estimate the percent contribution of each to Georges  Bank
              water. This project is a part of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest  Atlantic Field
              Studies, Phase 2 program.  ***
