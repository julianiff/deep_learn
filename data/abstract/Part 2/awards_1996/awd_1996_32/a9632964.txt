              Title:  Photorefractiove Solitons      Abstract    This research will
              investigate fundamental aspects of photorefractive solitons and will also
              demonstrate their practical potential in a series of important applications
              including high efficiency frequency difference generation in a soliton induced
              waveguide, ultra-narrow beam steering, optical wring and near-field
              reconfigurable interconnects. Research on photorefractive solitons in the
              semiconductors GaAs and InP will also be conducted in order to investigate
              theoretically predicted intensity dependent resonant behavior. Photorefractive
              solitons (an area pioneered by the PI) use the photorefractive nonlinearity:
              photorefractive solitons form when a photorefractive medium interacts with a
              beam of light such than the nonlinear index-change exactly compensates for
              diffractive spreading and traps the beam. Once generated, photorefractive
              solitons can act was graded-index waveguides in the volume of the bulk crystal
              and very weak soliton beam can guide a very intense beam of a longer
              (non-photorefractive)wavelength with no degradation. Photorefractive solitons
              are also robust and stable against material inhomogeneities. Forming a
              practical soliton trapped in both transverse dimensions in a bulk medium has
              been a long-standing open problem which has limited their practical use.
