Abstract    :
              CTS - 9632479   P. Somasundaran  Columbia University    ABSTRACT       The
              project deals with the use of adsorbed polymer-surfactant aggregates for the
              separation of organics and inorganics.  The objective is to develop an
              understanding of the mechanisms of separation using such aggregates
              (admicelles).  Selectivity will be achieved by introducing suitable functional
              groups on the polymer surfactant.  The project will involve spectroscopic
              characterization of the adsorbed aggregates and studies on the incorporation of
              organics and metal ions.  Partition coefficients and separation kinetics will
              be determined.  A correlation of aggregate properties with separation
              efficiency will be attempted.  The results may lead to the development of
              improved techniques for efficient removal of trace contaminants or separation
              of chemically similar materials.
