Abstract    :
              9632338  Antonovics    The laws of genetics predict that the genes contributed
              by each parent to their progeny will again reappear in a 50:50 ratio in the
              gametes of the progeny.  However, increasingly it has been found that some
              genes are "selfish" and alter the pattern of transmission so as to favor their
              representation in future generations.  This study will investigate a possible 
              example of such biased transmission involving the gene determining the mating
              type of  a fungus that infects and sterilizes the flowers of a common plant
              species.    Since fusion of cells of opposite mating types is necessary for the
              fungus to cause disease, the bias should be disadvantageous, but instead it has
              spread in natural populations.  The cause of the bias and possible reasons for
              its spread will be investigated.  The study is important in understanding
              disease spread in natural and agricultural plant populations, and in
              understanding unusual mechanisms in genetic transmission.  These mechanisms may
              prove useful for engineering the rapid spread of particular genes that either
              limit pathogen growth, or enhance the spread of pathogens used in the
              biological control of weeds.
