Abstract    :
              The project will create increased science opportunities for girls  ages 6-11 by
              piloting a hands-on science/gender equity model in  after school programs at
              four New York City settlement houses, and  by creating a Program Handbook for
              dissemination through United  Neighborhood Houses (UNH) and United Neighborhood
              Centers of  America (UNCA).  The model will be developed for both single-sex 
              and co-ed settings, and will include staff training, youth  activities, and a
              parent involvement component.  This project will  build on the proven success
              of Educational Equity Concept's  "Playtime is Science" program, with two
              important innovations:  an  increase focus specifically on improving results
              for girls, and a  new setting, i.e. community-based after-school sites instead
              of  public schools.    Specific objectives are:  a) to increase the amount of
              hands-on  science offered to girls ages 6-11 in settlement houses from none  to
              at least two hours per week; b) to develop both single-sex and  coed models for
              carrying out hands-on science with a gender equity  focus; c) to train staff in
              settlement houses in both hands-on  physical science and in gender equity; d)
              to involve parents of  participating girls in hands-on science and gender
              equity  activities; e) to give settlement house staff the training they  need
              to institutionalize the model program so that it will continue  beyond the
              grant period; f) to evaluate the success of the model;  g) to develop a Program
              Handbook; and h) to work in partnership  with UNH in New York City and UNCA
              nationally to disseminate the  model and materials.
