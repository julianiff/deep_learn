Abstract    :
              9632357  BEARDSLEY  This  project represents a continuation of the analysis  of 
              the  physical oceanographic information collected during Phase  I  of  the 
              U.S.  GLOBEC  Northwest Atlantic Field Studies  on  Georges  Bank.  
              Specifically,  this  project  will:  (a)  complete   the  processing  of 
              physical  data collected  in  the  Georges  Bank  Stratification   Study 
              (GBSS)  moored   array,   drifter;   and  hydrographic  components; (b) use
              these  results  combined  with  other  moored and hydrographic data to describe
              the  development  of  stratification on Georges Bank; (c) describe and  model 
              the  water  column  response to surface forcing  along  the  southern  flank, 
              with emphasis on the surface and bottom boundary layers;  (d)  describe  and 
              model a massive intrusion  of  Slope  water,  apparently driven by a warm-core
              ring; and (e) compare the  1995  field  data  with prognostic model simulations
              driven  with  the  measured surface forcing.  ***
