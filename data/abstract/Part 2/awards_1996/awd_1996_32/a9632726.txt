Abstract    :
              DMS9632726  Takesaki, Masamichi     This proposal would provide participant
              support costs only for US participants in the West Coast Operator Algebra
              Seminar, an ongoing and very successful yearly seminar.     "Operator algebras"
              is a very exciting area of research that accounts for about half of the funding
              in my part of the analysis program.  One of the organizers, Vaughan Jones,
              received a Fields Medal in 1990 for his work in this area.  This is a very cost
              effective way to promote research in this important area and to encourage
              reciprocal relationships with our Canadian colleagues.
