Abstract    :
                   9632840     BUCKLIN       Sequence-specific gene amplification by the
              polymerase chain  reaction (PCR) will be used to identify and discriminate 
              individuals of two calanoid copepod species Pseudocalanus  moultoni and P.
              newmani, at all stages.  Temporal and spatial  distribution of larval,
              juvenile, and adult female stages of  both species will be determined from
              zooplankton samples  during the broad-scale surveys of U.S. GLOBEC Northwest 
              Atlantic Field Studes Phase 2 on Georges Bank. Spatial  patterns of
              distribution will be characterized monthly to  determine how stage-specific
              distributions interact with  circulation patterns on the Bank. Image analysis
              will provide  size estimates for individuals of each stage to ascertain 
              whether rates of growth and development differ between  species. Collaborative
              work with bio-physical modellers will  be conducted to place the
              stage-structured populations of each  species in realistic flow fields.  It is
              hypothesized that the  life histories of the Pseudocalanus spp. on Georges Bank
               differ in ways that are suited to the geographic distribution  and
              reproductive ecology of the species.  ***
