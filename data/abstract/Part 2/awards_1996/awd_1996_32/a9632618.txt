Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, Regitze Vold will develop new techniques for the NMR  
              study of molecular structure and dynamics of solids and ordered phases.    The
              emphasis in these studies is on inorganic, bioinorganic, and   biologically
              important systems.  Specific projects include the   investigation of novel,
              magnetically aligned discoidal nematic   phospholipid bilayered micelles
              (bicelles), a multi-nuclear spin   relaxation study to test models of
              relaxation and internal motion of   membrane-associated peptides in ordered
              bicelles, the continuation of   studies of the structure and dynamics of the
              mitochondrial redox cofactor   Q10 (ubiquinone) in phospholipid bilayers, and
              magic angle spinning (MAS)   experiments on paramagnetic inorganic and
              bioinorganic model compounds.    The common theme of the experiments in this
              project is to extend and   apply NMR spectroscopy to structural and dynamic
              problems in chemistry   which will provide information about the binding,
              conformation, and   dynamics of biologically relevant molecules as well as
              about solid   transition-metal complexes.  The approaches being developed in
              this work   will help increase the impact of solid-state NMR on structural
              biology.
