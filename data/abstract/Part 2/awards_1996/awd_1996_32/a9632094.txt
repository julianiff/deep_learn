Abstract    :
              9632094  Reisman  This proposal involves a number of senior undergraduate design
               projects targeted at aiding the disabled.  Through their work,  the students
              will design and implement new technologies, fulfill  academic requirements, and
              produce a usable device.  The target  population, or consumers, includes
              individuals with spinal cord  injuries, stroke survivors, individuals with
              sensory or  neurologic deficiency, and geriatric individuals.  The work will 
              be performed in conjunction with the Kessler Institute for  Rehabilitation in
              West Orange, New Jersey.  The primary objective  of the proposed projects is to
              increase safety and independence  for their consumers.  The devices produced
              will be designed with  particular attention to affordability, reliability and 
              portability.  More specifically, the projects will address  problems in
              personal hygiene (e.g., feeding, dressing and  toileting), and difficulties in
              verbal, written and telephone  communication.  The projects will also include
              devices for  handling money and credit cards when driving, page turning and 
              accessing laptop computers.  ***
