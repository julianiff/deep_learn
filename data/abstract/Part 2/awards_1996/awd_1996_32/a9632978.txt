Abstract    :
              9632978  Kirkpatrick    Theoretical research will be done on low temperature 
              disordered electronic systems.  The four specific topics of  emphasis are: (1)
              disordered (and clean) itinerant quantum  ferromagnets; (2) disordered
              itinerant quantum  antiferromagnets; (3) the metal-insulator transition as a 
              random field problem; (4) general aspects of field theories  for disordered
              interacting electrons.  The methodologies  include the construction of
              effective field theories,  renormalization group techniques, and many-body
              perturbation  theory.  %%%  The problem of strongly interacting electron
              systems is a  major one in modern condensed matter physics.  Researchers  have
              discovered over the past few years that such  fundamental issues as magnetism
              in metals are not really  understood at a fundamental level and that existing 
              theoretical methods are not sufficient to gain a deep  understanding of the
              problem.  This grant will look at a  number of problems related to the central
              one of strongly  interacting electron systems and use, and develop, a variety 
              of powerful mathematical techniques in order to do this.  ***
