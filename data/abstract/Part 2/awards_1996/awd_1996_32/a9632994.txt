Abstract    :
              9632994  Gao    In  this group project Lehigh University, collaborating with 
              the  University  of  Maine,  is investigating  the  role  of  niobium in
              environmentally-assisted crack growth at elevated  temperatures   in 
              nickel-based  superalloys.    From   this  interdisciplinary activity the
              researchers plan  to  develop  mechanistic    models   that   quantify    the  
               functional  relationships  between the crack growth rates  and  internal 
              variables   (e.g.,  niobium  concentration)   and   external  variables  (e.g.,
              environment and mechanical loading).   The  program  is  designed to develop a
              fundamental understanding  of   the   mechanisms  of  environmentally-assisted,
                high-  temperature  crack growth and to demonstrate the  importance  and 
              effectiveness of predictive mechanistic  models,  using  selected nickel-based
              alloys as the prime vehicle for  crack  growth  rate studies in engineering
              materials.  The research  program   consists  of  four  parallel  activities 
              covering  environmentally-assisted  crack  growth  in  the  areas   of 
              mechanical,   microstructural,  chemical,  and   mechanistic  modeling.  %%% 
              The research is based on: (l) a recent fundamental discovery  that  niobium  is
               the  principal  element  responsible  for  environmental enhancement of crack
              growth (EECG) in  Inconel  718  alloy (this finding identifies correctly, for
              the first  time,  the  key  material variable for EECG and  provides  a 
              consistent explanation for the long-known varying degree  of  environmental 
              sensitivity among the superalloys);  and  (2)  the  need  for  management of
              engineered systems  and  aging  infrastructure   and  life  cycle  costs,  
              which   requires  mechanistic  models for accurate prediction of crack  growth 
              rates.  ***
