Abstract    :
              9632600  Theirs  The New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) has been funded to support
              two specimen cataloguers to help complete the North American Bryophytes
              Catalogue. The project will involve databasing 96,000 North American bryophyte
              specimens from the NYBG bryophyte herbarium. NSF-supported staff would
              catalogue 62,400 specimens (65%), and NYBG-supported staff will catalogue the
              remaining 33,600 over a two-year period, using the NYBG specimen databasing
              application CASSIA. The NYBG bryophyte herbarium the largest in the western
              hemisphere, with approximately 600,000 specimens. Long-term plans call for
              databasing the entire bryophyte collection, but the North American collections
              will be done first to expedite preparation of the bryophyte volume for the
              Flora of North America project. The synchronization of the two projects  will
              be very advantageous to both. The NYBG bryophyte holdings represent the largest
              single source of raw data for the preparation of the Flora. Participants in the
              project (authors, reviewers and editors) will be able to access the NYBG North
              American Bryophytes Catalogue via the Internet to select specimens to borrow
              for morphological study, to determine distributions of taxa, and to obtain
              habitat and type specimen data.  This project is not only a partnership between
              the New York Botanical Garden and the Flora of North America project, but also
              between the Research Collections in Systematics & Ecology Program and the
              Database Activities Program of the NSF, which have co-funded the project.
