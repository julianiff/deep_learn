Abstract    :
              Swanson  9632921  The central question guiding the HJ Andrews LTER is: How do
              land use, natural disturbances and climate change affect three key ecosystem
              properties: carbon dynamics, biodiversity, and hydrology? These three ecosystem
              properties are of high scientific and social interest and represent three
              rather different categories of ecological response to landscape patterns. The
              principle spatial scale for synthesizing results of these studies is the
              Andrews Forest landscape (6400 ha) and the adjacent upper Blue River watershed
              (9000 ha). The time scale of interest spans the past 500 yrs and extends
              several centuries into the future, based on model projections of alternative
              possible future conditions. LTER studies link closely with work at larger
              spatial scales and paleoecological time scales. This research follows a
              strategic plan to answer this guiding question by continuing to use the Andrews
              LTER as the core of the large, multi-faceted research program based at Andrews
              Experimental Forest in Oregon. Since its inception in 1980, the Andrews Forest
              LTER program has consisted of long-term experiments, measurement programs,
              short-term studies and modeling analyses in a series of research components:
              climate, hydrology, disturbance regimes/landscape dynamics, vegetation
              succession, biological diversity, carbon and nutrient dynamics, and
              forest-stream interactions. Under this renewal proposal, four related synthesis
              efforts will take place: effects of species on ecosystem functioning, pattern
              and process during early succession, analysis of small watersheds, and analysis
              of landscape dynamics.   Research under the continuation of this LTER activity
              will advance scientific understanding of controls on ecosystem structure and
              function in the forested landscapes of the Pacific Northwest.
