Abstract    :
              9632395  SULLIVAN  As part of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Studies,
              Phase  2 program this project will conduct laboratory and field studies of 
              impacts of invertebrate predators on fish eggs and larvae on  Georges Bank.
              Predation-related mortality is one loss term  affecting populations of the
              target species of fishes and copepods  on Georges Bank. This project will
              utilize mesocosm experiments to  determine prey selection and feeding rates of
              the planktonic  hydroid, Clytia gracilis, at times the most abundant predator
              in  this region, and the ctenophore, Pleurobrachia pileus, the only 
              invertebrate confirmed to be feeding on eggs and larvae of cod. The  field
              component of this project will provide abundance data on  hydroids and other
              invertebrate predators and their prey. These  laboratory and field results will
              be combined to estimate predation-  related mortality in the context of
              physical mechanisms that act to  concentrate or disperse plankton.  ***
