Abstract    :
              OCE-9632215    This project will develop a new technique (U-Th) for dating
              marine  aragonite sediments beyond the range achievable by 14C.   Preliminary
              results on aragonite have produced ages for Stages 5  and 7 in agreement with
              the orbitally-tuned 18O scale.  The project  will test these results by
              attempting to duplicate them elsewhere,  extend the dating to Stage 9, and
              improve the precision.  Direct  and independent age control on deep-sea
              carbonates is essential for  models concerning the ocean's role in global
              climate change,  especially such aspects as regional linkages and feedbacks.
