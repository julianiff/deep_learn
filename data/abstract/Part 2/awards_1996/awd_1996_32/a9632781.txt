              project explores the possibility of employing currently used liquid fuels in
              fuel-cell vehicles. It is neither convenient nor safe to carry hydrogen on
              board commercial trucks, buses, or other types of vehicles.  The wide use of
              fuel cells will require conversion of standard fuels into hydrogen.  The use of
              reformers for generation of hydrogen from light hydrocarbons is a standard
              industrial practice, but this technique cannot be directly used for heavy
              fuels.  In Phase 1, the technical and economic feasibility of using an on-board
              pyrolysis unit to preprocess diesel fuel for the reformer was demonstrated. The
              results from the Phase I research suggest a strong possibility of achieving
              diesel reforming to H2 in a single reactor.  The main objective of the Phase II
              project is to design, construct, and test a diesel preprocessor compatible with
              a 16 kW fuel cell.  This objective will be accomplished in four tasks: (1)
              Laboratory study on the pyrolysis unit (more extensive testing of diesel fuels;
              testing of several catalysts; performance optimization; control of sulfur and
              CO emissions); (2) Design, construction and testing of a prototype fuel
              preprocessor compatible with a 10 kW fuel cell, (3) Simulation of the
              diesel-processor/fuel-cell system; (4) System assessment.      The commercial
              applications for fuel cells are numerous and they include fuel-cell buses,
              automobiles, tractor-trailers, and trains.  The availability of the proposed
              preprocessing unit would allow for these vehicles to be powered by readily
              available liquid fuels.  This would greatly accelerate the introduction of this
              technology into mass transit and help reduce air pollution in urban centers
              (particulates, NO., CO, and unburned hydrocarbons).    ***
