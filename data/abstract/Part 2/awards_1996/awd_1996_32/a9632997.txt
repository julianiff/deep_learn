Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, Crim will continue studies of the influence of  
              vibrational excitation on the course and rate of bimolecular chemical  
              reactions.  The current work will extend the investigations from the gas   into
              the liquid phase in the expectation of demonstrating selective   control of the
              course of a bimolecular reaction by preferentially   breaking a chosen bond. 
              In the proposed gas-phase studies visible or   infrared photons will excite
              vibrations of bonds which then react with   photolytically created atoms to
              form products.  Measuring the quantum   states of the products helps identify
              the pathways of the reactions   accelerated by the vibrational excitation.  In
              favorable cases, one can   cleave a bond preferentially.  Vibrationally driven
              bimolecular reactions   in liquids and supercritical fluids require ultrafast
              excitation of   reagents and detection of products.  Nonlinear light generation
              will   provide the excitation and absorption or coherent Raman scattering will 
               be used for detection.  Collaborations with a theoretician will allow   tests
              of dynamical theories and potential energy surface calculations.   In this
              research the outcome of a chemical reaction between a polyatomic   molecule and
              an atom is directly controlled by exciting the molecular   vibration of the
              bond which is expected to break in the course of the   reaction.  This
              expectation is based on the fact that the geometry change   that occurs in
              going from reactants to products first requires the   stretching of bonds
              similar to that which occurs during molecular   vibrations.  The results of
              this research are expected to have an impact   in atmospheric chemistry,
              combustion, and the understanding of plasmas
