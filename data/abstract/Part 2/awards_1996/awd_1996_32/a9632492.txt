Abstract    :
              Abstract  Fontijn  9632492    The proposed work represents an extension of the
              PIs current program to provide rate coefficient and mechanistic data for
              individual reactions of toxic metal species up to high temperatures which are
              of importance in incineration processes.  In the previous work the reactions of
              Cu, Cr, Sn and Cd with oxidants such as N2O, O2 , Cl2, and HCl were
              investigated as a function of temperature using three unique types of
              apparatus.  A semi- empirical configuration interaction (SECI) theory was also
              developed to help correlate the experimental results.    The proposed program
              will extend the experimental effort to include reactions of Ni, Pb, Sb, and As
              in elemental, oxide and chloride forms with HCl, O2, CO2, and H2O, as a
              function of temperature, using the High Temperature Flow Reactor (HTFF), Metals
              High Temperature Photochemistry (MHTP) apparatus and a mass spectrometer HTFF
              combination.  These studies will be complimented by further development of the
              semi-predictive theories SECI and MTST (metals transition state theory) in
              order to extend and compare with the experimental data.
