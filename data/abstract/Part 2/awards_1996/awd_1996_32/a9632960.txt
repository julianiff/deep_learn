Abstract    :
              9632960  Steinberg  This project will test a new concept that may lead to early 
              detection of tumors in breasts by echo ultrasound.  Early  detection by
              ultrasound or any other imaging modality  requires high spatial resolution and
              high contrast  resolution.  Modern ultrasound systems can detect objects as 
              small as  1 mm when used in the hands of skilled operators.  Contrast 
              resolution of ultrasound is excellent relative to x-ray  mammography (the gold
              standard for breast cancer screening  tests), and ultrasound is used in
              distinguishing dense  breast tumors from clear, liquid-filled cysts, provided
              the  cysts are large enough to be distinguished from noise  (speckle) in the
              image.  Therefore, contrast resolution  becomes the ultimate limiting factor in
              high quality echo  ultrasound. The elimination of speckle is the goal of the 
              project.    This project addresses contrast resolution and offers a way 
              materially to improve it using a novel, automatic signal  processor instrument
              with real-time potential.  The  instrument, which was developed during a radar
              study of 3-D  high resolution imagery, has strong potential for  discriminating
              between soft breast tissue and dense tissue  typical of lesions (tumors). 
              Success with the project would  provide the ability of ultrasound systems to
              detect breast  cancer at an earlier stage and therefore improve the 
              probability of long term survival.    This award is made under the guidelines
              applicable to Small  Grants for Exploratory Research.  ***
