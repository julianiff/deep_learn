Abstract    :
              9632898  Machta    This grant supports the work of a mid-career materials 
              theorist who is getting involved in the interface between  conventional
              materials properties and the analysis and  development of complex computational
              algorithms.  In  particular, this grant supports further development and 
              applications of  the invaded cluster algorithm, devised  earlier by the PI. 
              The other two projects are: (1)  investigation of computational complexity in
              collaboration  with a computer science colleague and (2) a collaboration  with
              experimental colleagues on the flow properties of  fluids in porous media.  %%%
               This grant supports work at the interface of computer  science and materials
              theory.  There are projects where the  computational needs are such as to
              require whole new  framework. The PI has successfully proposed a highly 
              efficient way to calculating the equilibrium  properties,  called invaded
              cluster method.  This grant further supports  development and applications of
              this work.  There is a  project to study the complexity of a computation, a
              subject  likely to be of considerable significance in future.  Finally there is
              a project to study fluid flow through the  porous media.  ***
