Abstract    :
              9632970  Edelson    The Second International Conference on the Learning Sciences
                (ICLS 96) is scheduled for July 17-24, 1996 on the campus of  Northwestern
              University in Evanston, IL. The objective of this  conference is to bring

              focus on the issues of learning  and instruction. The conference's theme
              "Learning for the Real  World" emphasizes the conference's goal of creating a
              community  that is capable of developing theories and designs that account for 
              the complexity of learning and teaching in real world settings. The  audience
              for this conference is researchers in the fields of  education, psychology, and
              computer science and practitioners from  formal education, informal education,
              and training.    Anticipated topics at ICLS '96 include:         Design. Design
              of learning and teaching environments,       including innovative curricula,
              multimedia, artificial       intelligence, and telecommunications technologies,
              and       classroom activity structures for supporting learning and      
              teaching.       Cognition. Models of the structures and processes of learning  
                  and teaching by which organized knowledge, skills, and       understanding
              are acquired.       Social context. The social, organizational, and cultural   
                 dynamics of learning and teaching across the range of formal       and
