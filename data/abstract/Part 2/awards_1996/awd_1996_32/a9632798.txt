Abstract    :
                Raad  9632798  The development of the commercial microwave technology depends
              on the design of reliable devices, which requires a thermal analysis technique
              technology that is capable of resolving at the device level both the spatial
              and temporal scales of submicron Integrated Circuits (ICs). Current
              capabilities ate inadequate in addressing these issues.  The proposed GOALI
              research project will develop a numerical simulation method to investigate
              transient heat transfer in submicron features as well as an experimental
              capability both to measure their thermal properties and to provide temperature
              data to validate the simulation.  The GOALI research project is in
              collaboration with Texas Instruments and Hewlett-Packard.  The outcome of the
              study has potential to advance the process understanding of low cost design for
              electronics manufacturing.
