Abstract    :
              96-32212  Bishop  This is an award for support of international travel by 12 
              persons who will participate in the Biennial Conference of  the International
              Association on Water Quality to be held in  Singapore from June 23-28, 1996. 
              The persons selected will  represent a cross-section of research areas being
              supported  by awards from environmental engineering and associated  engineering
              topics by the National Science Foundation.  Their responsibility will be to
              participate in sessions of  the conference appropriate to their research area
              and to  contribute to a report that will be submitted by the  Principal
              Investigator to the National Science Foundation  for potential use in program
              planning.    The International Association on Water Quality meets  biennially.
              Its sessions reflect the interdisciplinary  nature of engineering issues
              associated with treatment of  water to meet quality standards for its intended
              use, and  after use, to prepare the wastewater for reuse or for  discharge to
              meet environmental quality standards.***
