Abstract    :
              9632986   Srinivasan   This GOALI/Faculty and Graduate Student Internship award
              will investigate control and design approaches that can achieve contouring
              errors of less than 20 microns at machine tool feed rates of 10-20 m/s.  The
              technical approach will use control algorithms that make effective use of
              machine dynamic models and two stage actuation concepts:  short range-high
              bandwidth and long range-lower bandwidth actuators.  These approaches are
              necessary and the performance results are possible with the six degree of
              freedom parallel link machines based on the Stewart platform machine tool
              designs introduced in recent years.  This project will be carried out by a team
              of researchers at Ohio State University, the National Institute of Standard and
              Technology (NIST) and Ingersoll Milling Machine Company.  It will support the
              faculty principal investigator and a graduate student as they experimentally
              determine dynamic parameters of Ingersoll's version of the Stewart platform
              machine tool at NIST.  The research team will design  a controller using this
              dynamic information and the two stage actuation concept, followed by
              experimental  implementation at both NIST and Ingerqoll to evaluate
              performance.       The technical impact of this research will be greater
              productivity in the manufacture of dies and molds through a combination of new
              structural designs integrated with new control concepts.  Because of the three
              way partnership established between a university, national lab, and industrial
              firm, this project offers an ideal model for technology transfer.
