Abstract    :
              9632853  Magnuson  Lakes are central to the vitality of landscapes and society.
              As collectors of water, energy, solutes, and pollutants from the landscape and
              atmosphere, as habitats for aquatic biota, and as attractors of human
              activities, lakes affect and are affected by natural and human-induced changes
              in the local and regional landscape and atmosphere. The North Temperate Lakes
              Long-term Ecological Research program seeks to understand the long-term ecology
              of lakes and their interactions with a range of relevant landscape,
              atmospheric, and human processes. This program has the following interrelated
              goals:    * Perceive long-term changes in the physical, chemical, and
              biological properties of lake ecosystems,     * Understand interactions among
              physical, chemical, an biological processes within lakes and their influence on
              lake characteristics and long-term dynamics,      * Develop a regional
              understanding of lake ecosystems through an analysis of the patterns and
              processes organizing lake districts,     * Develop a regional understanding of
              lake ecosystems through integration of atmospheric, hydrologic, and biotic
              processes, and     * Understand the way human, hydrologic, and biogeochemical
              processes interact within the terrestrial landscape to affect lakes and the way
              lakes, in turn, influence these interactions.    Research will examine
              patterns, processes, and interactions of lakes and their surroundings at a
              nested set of spatial and temporal scales. This comprehensive long-term
              research program will yield important understanding of landscape-lake-human
              interactions that will have direct relevance to development of policies
              affecting the future of the Upper Great Lakes Region and enhancement of the
              quality of life for its residents.
