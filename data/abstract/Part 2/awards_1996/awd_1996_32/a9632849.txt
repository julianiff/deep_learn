Abstract    :
                  The award covers development of protocols and working code to facilitate 
              the operation of distributed information services.  The initial goals are  to
              automate the acquisition, conversion and mounting of information from a 
              variety of autonomous sources onto a common Web platform.  Ultimately, the 
              architectural model and protocols will provide the basis to implement 
              additional information services across any distributed environment.
