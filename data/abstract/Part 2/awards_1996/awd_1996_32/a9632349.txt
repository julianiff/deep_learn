Abstract    :
              9632349  BRINK  Physical and physical/biological measurements will investigate
              the  sources,  retention and losses of zooplankton and  ichthyoplankton  over 
              Georges Bank during the U.S.GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic  Field  Studies  Phase  2
               program.  This project  will  focus  on  issues  involving retention (in the
              form of recirculation around the inner  part of the Bank), losses from the
              southern flank of the Bank into  the  Slope  Water,  and losses westward into
              the  Middle  Atlantic  Bight.  A  year-long, 9-element moored array will be
              placed  along  the  southeastern end of the Bank to measure the local 
              kinematics  and  dynamics  of recirculation and to observe properties  of  the 
              shelf break front (which is in effect the southern boundary of the  Bank).  
              Three highly resolved (1 km or better resolution) SeaSoar  surveys  are 
              proposed  along the southern  flank  to  investigate  losses  due  to 
              warm-core  rings, wind events,  and  shelf  break  eddies.   SeaSoar  surveys
              will measure normal physical  variables  (currents, temperature and salinity),
              and will include zooplankton  observations  made with a Video Plankton Recorder
               (VPR)  and  the  Tracor Acoustic Profiling System (TAPS).  ***
