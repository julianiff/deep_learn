Abstract    :
              Database query optimizers are complex systems prone to bugs.  The intention is
              to counter this phenomenon by developing a design process that separates the
              areas that can be formalized and reasoned about from those that require
              crafting and experimentation.  Formal techniques are applied to the
              specification of optimizer modules (or rule blocks), which can be constructed
              by expressing provable rules and rule firing strategies.  Rules are expressed
              declaratively (i.e., without code) to permit theorem prover verification.  Rule
              blocks group related rules and propose an order for firing them and a strategy
              for deciding when firing is appropriate.  Associated tools automate rule
              verification, and permit the effects of rules and rule blocks on queries to be
              visualized.  Assembly of proven modules into a workable whole requires
              experimentation and evaluation. Tools to assist in this process permit
              visualization of the assembled optimizer's flow of control on given query sets,
              and measurement of the performance improvements as a result of transformations
              of queries.  The aim of the project is to develop a methodology and associated
              suite of tools for the development of effective, correct and extensible query
              optimizers.  This work contributes to the specification, design, verification
              and empirical evaluation of query optimizers.
