Abstract    :
              9632677  Williams    Computational researchers in the states of Alabama,
              Kentucky,  Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and West Virginia (a.k.a. 
              the 6-PAC) have formed the South East Partnership to Share  Computational
              Resources (SEPSCoR).  The supercomputers located in  each of these states will
              be linked by high speed wide-area  networks to form a more powerful "virtual
              supercomputer", which  will be focused on the solution of highly intractable
              computational  problems, such as the modeling and molecular dynamics of complex
               materials. This shared resource will be available to all  researchers who are
              approved by the consortium. The high-speed  networks which will make this
              possible will be managed by a  partnership with the Southeastern Universities
              Research Association  (SURA) and the networking Corporation, Bolt, Beranek and
              Newman  (BBN). This award will fund the start-up costs of this networking 
              partnership in its first year, after which, a full maintenance  proposal will
              be submitted to the Division of Networking and  Communications Research and
              Infrastructure. The net result of this  project will be the demonstration of
              how computational science can  be advanced through the utilization of an
              advanced networking  infrastructure. The initial projects using this interstate
              facility  will be in the area of computational materials research, but in the 
              long term, other numerically-intensive areas will benefit as well.
