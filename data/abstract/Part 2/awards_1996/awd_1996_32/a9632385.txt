Abstract    :
              Proposal Number:        ECS-9632385  Principal Investigator:     Chung Chan   
              This proposal seeks support from NSF for the conference:  "the IEEE 1996
              International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)" which will held in Boston,
              Massachusetts, June 3-5, 1996.  Funds from NSF will be used to partially
              support costs of travel, accommodations, and registration fees of young
              American scientists and graduate students in cases where their attendance at
              the meeting would not otherwise be possible.    We have added several new
              conference activities this year. A corporate management panel will discuss
              opportunities in plasma science from an industrial perspective. This Monday
              evening session, open to all attendees, will allow graduate students to see for
              themselves what various industries hope to get from plasma science in the next
              several years. We have expanded the number of technical session categories to
              twenty-eight, grouped under seven super-session categories, with three new
              session topics: inertial confinement fusion, thermal plasma processing, and
              flat panel displays. Two special sessions on "Computer Simulation of Vacuum
              Power Tubes" and "Space Plasma Measurements - New Techniques and Technology"
              have been introduced to promote interest in these areas. An afternoon meeting
              on stimulating "Advanced Lighting Research" will take place on Wednesday;
              representatives from government and industries will discuss new research
              proposals. This is a special attraction for graduate students to participate in
              research that impacts the environment as well as our US energy policies.   
              With such diverse programs, ICOPS '96 showcases a steady expansion of plasma
              science research into critical areas that help shape the nation's economic well
              being and industrial competitiveness. The plenary sessions highlight recent
              advances in plasma science research as well as the role of past and future
              government funding. Students may participate in any of the above mentioned
              areas which will enhance and develop their rese arch and scholarship.
