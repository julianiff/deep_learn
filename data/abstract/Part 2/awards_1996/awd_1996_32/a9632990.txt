Abstract    :
              9632990  Zatz  This project examines Chinese community policing during the
              economic reform era. Chinese informal social control practices are rooted in
              China's historical, social and cultural traditions. By focusing on community
              policing during this transitional period, this project will contribute to our
              understanding of community policing globally.  Braithwaite's (1989) theory of
              reintegrative shaming serves as the theoretical framework. The primary social
              conditions for reintegrative shaming are communitarianism and interdependency.
              Although the Chinese community has been largely shaped by the state, which
              inevitably deviates from the Western conceptualization of community, the
              Chinese decentralized and informal social control strategies at the grass-roots
              level entail the essence of a community-based social control system. By
              identifying key variables central to Chinese community policing, this research
              will unveil how, in the Chinese context, contradictions between law and order
              are reconciled, the interdependent relationship between the community and the
              police is sustained, and residents are mobilized.  The research setting
              consists of two communities in Shanghai, China. Sites are selected to reflect
              contrasting socioeconomic characteristics of the community. Multiple research
              methods are employed, including historical, documentary and policy analysis,
              field work, and a survey of neighborhood residents to test and elaborate the
              theory of reintegrative shaming In the: Chinese context  %%%%
