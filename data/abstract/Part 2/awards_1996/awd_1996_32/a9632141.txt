Abstract    :
              9632141  Johnson  This is a theoretical program consisting of two parts:  to
              study  the fundamental properties of integer and fractional quantum Hall 
              effect (QHE) and to study nonlinear mesoscopic transport.  More  specifically,
              in the first part there will be a study of the rich  ground states and
              transitions as a function of magnetic field in  small quantum dots,  using  a
              previously developed ensemble  density functional method which will be extended
              to include spin  degrees of freedom and current distributions.  Further 
              applications of this method include  a study of the off-diagonal  long range
              order in the fractional QHE and detailed properties of  the composite fermion. 
              In the nonlinear mesoscopic transport,  there will be a comparative study of a
              formalism developed by the  PI's and the traditional approaches such as
              nonequilibrium  Green's function with possible application to the second
              harmonic  generation in quantum wires.  %%%  In this grant supporting
              collaborative theoretical research by  the two young PI's, the main focus is on
              two subjects:  properties of  layers of electrons subjected to intense magnetic
               fields, a subject referred to as quantum Hall effect and on  response of small
              devices  to intense radiation.  Both of these  projects involve special
              theoretical techniques  developed by  these PI's.  ***
