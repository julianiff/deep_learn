Abstract    :
                9623918  Thiel    Quasicrystals are structures which have recently become  an 
              important topic of research because of their potential  technological
              importance, for  example,  as  wear-resistant,  corrosion resistant,  low 
              friction coatings.  However,  little  work is done to  understand  the  surface
               interfacial  phenomena  that determine these exciting  properties.  In
              addition the properties of the bulk  materials still remain elusive.  A
              Conference  and Workshops  on the properties of quasicrystals  will  be held 
              at Iowa  State University, August 19-23 1996. The conference will  discuss (1)
              existing and potential applications of  quasicrystals,  (2) surface  interface
              properties of  quasicrystals, and (3) potential  new quasicrystalline 
              materials. The objective of  the  conference  is  to bring  leading scientists
              from France and Japan and stimulate  national and  international collaborations
              necessary for  further growth of this important field of research in the  US.
