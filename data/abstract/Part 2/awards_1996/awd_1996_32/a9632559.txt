Abstract    :
              Abstract  ATM-9632559  Rosen, Richard D.  Atmospheric and Environment Research,
              Inc.  Title: Cycling of Momentum Through the Coupled Climate System    This
              grant is for three year period to study the exchanges of  angular momentum that
              dynamically coupled the atmosphere, the ocean  and the solid earth, on seasonal
              and longer time scales.  The  reanalysis products from different sources will
              comprise the main  observational data base in additional to satellite
              measurements.   Recourse will also be made to momentum balance and to gauge the
               stat of art of the GCMs regarding momentum balance.    This work is of a
              fundamental nature in understanding the general  circulation of the coupled
              earth system.
