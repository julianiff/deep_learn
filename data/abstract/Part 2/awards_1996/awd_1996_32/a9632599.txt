Abstract    :
              9632599   Davidovits,   This project is a laboratory investigation of
              heterogeneous reactions important to the chemistry of the atmosphere. In
              collaboration with Aerodyne Research, Inc., the investigators have developed
              two techniques for studying gas uptake processes and measuring mass
              accommodation coefficients of trace atmospheric species on water and other
              liquids. In the first method, suitable for measuring relatively large gas
              uptakes, the gas phase species interacts with a controllable stream of small
              monodispersed droplets of known size, temperature, and chemical composition. In
              the second method, used to study gases with relatively  smaller uptakes, the
              trace gas is contained in controlled bubbles entrained in a flow of the liquid
              of interest.   In this project, gas uptake and co-deposition studies for nitric
              oxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitrate radical, dinitrogen pentoxide, nitric acid,
              nitrous acid, ammonia, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and hydroxyl radical will
              be carried out as a function of temperature with aqueous solutions, sulfuric
              acid and nitrosyl sulfuric acid solutions. The effect of photochemistry,
              surface charge, and atmospherically relevant additives will be examined. These
              data will eventually lead to a general, predictive understanding of chemistry
              at the gas-liquid interface.  ***
