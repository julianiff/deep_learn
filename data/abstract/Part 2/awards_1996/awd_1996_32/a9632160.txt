              Abstract  ATM-9632160  Kutzbach, John E.  University of Wisconsin  Title:
              Collaborative Research: Analysis of Simulated and Observed  Changes in Climate
              and Environments Across the Permian Deglaciation    The Permian Period contains
              a transition from a major glaciation to  a fully ice-free state.  This
              transition has been ascribed to an  increase in atmospheric CO2, and could thus
              provide an analog in the  geologic record for the likely results of human
              perturbations to  the Earth system over the next millennium.  This award
              supports a  project to assemble the extensive sources of information on the 
              Permian environment into a unified relational database.  This will  permit a
              global assessment of data patterns and their temporal and  spatial
              relationships and will help to determine whether local  changes are due to
              continental motions, rather than "global  change."  Another aspect of this work
              is to determine the  reliability of the paleoclimate indicators (e.g. dating 
              uncertainties), and thus how unequivocally such data may be used to  validate
              the climate model predictions.  These experiments will  establish the
              sensitivity to realistic changes during the Permian  in two important climate
              forcing factors, paleogeography and  atmospheric CO2, and their role in
              explaining the large-scale  features of the Permian deglaciation.
