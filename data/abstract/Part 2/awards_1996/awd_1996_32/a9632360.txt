Abstract    :
              9632360  Mao   This award provides funding to the Carnegie Institution of
              Washington for the construction of a microdiffraction facility at the National
              Synchrotron Light Source  (NSLS) of the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The
              facility will make use of the ultrabright X-ray beam from a superconducting
              wiggler insertion device at NSLS and provide for focus of the beam down to a
              6-10 micron diameter at the position of samples subjected to ultrahigh static
              pressures of up to two to three hundred megabars in diamond anvil pressure
              devices. Laser heating of the microsamples will also allow heating of samples
              to several thousand degrees simultaneously with high pressure. The X-ray
              microdiffraction facility will be used primarily by Earth scientists at
              Carnegie and elsewhere investigating the properties of materials in the Earth's
              deep interior.  ***
