Abstract    :
              Chari  9632054    This project consists of research on the transmission
              mechanism linking monetary policy to outcome.  The first part quantifies the
              extent to which fluctuations in output and inflation in postwar US data are due
              to the fact that monetary policy is conducted under discretion.  This issue is
              addressed in a class of dynamic, quantitative, general equilibrium models with
              purposeful policy makers.  These models are sued to determine how much the
              conduct of monetary policy can be improved by alternative feasible
              institutional arrangements.  The preliminary models described here convey
              interesting insights about the characteristics of economies in which monetary
              policy is conducted without commitment.  One such insights is that discretion
              can exacerbate volatility and increase instability in the economy.  Another is
              that delegating monetary policy authority to a central banker who dislikes
              inflation more than the benevolent planner may also increase instability. 
              These insights suggest that episodes like the great inflation of the 1980s were
              an inevitable consequence of discretion.  The models imply that various
              institutional reforms limiting the flexibility of policymakers would lead to
              more desirable outcomes.  The second part of this project consists of two types
              of quantitative models of the monetary transmission mechanism.  One consists of
              models of wage contracting which rest on secure microeconomic foundations,. 
              The other studies staggered price-setting.  Both types are designed to address
              the short-coming of existing models that monetary disturbances do not lead to
              large, persistent fluctuations in output.  The project also studies the sources
              of the vast inequality of incomes among countries.
