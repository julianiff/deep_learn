Abstract    :
              9632686  Davis    In this project, the PI will oversee the organization of  a
              workshop to address the future of climate-related  physical oceanographic
              research.  The ocean's role in  climate has been a central theme in the World 
              Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), and is expected to be  a crucial
              ingredient of a major international effort to  study Climate Variability
              (CLIVAR).  To date, planning for  CLIVAR has been complex and
              multi-disciplinary, with three  manageable subprograms emerging, focusing,
              respectively,  on seasonal to interannual time scales, decadal to  centennial
              time scales, and anthropogenic climate change.  This workshop will complement
              the separate-timescale,  multidisciplinary international planning with an 
              oceanographic program, Ocean CLIVAR, that spans all three  components.  The
              objectives are to engage a  broad segment of the community to identify the key 
              oceanographic questions that need to be answered to  meet the objectives of the
              multi-disciplinary science plan  for CLIVAR, and to develop an implementation 
              plan to answer these questions.  A single workshop, with  three subgroups
              focused on sustained observations,  modeling, and process studies will be
              convened. A report  will be produced for community comment and to provide 
              input for a U.S. contribution to the international CLIVAR  workshops, the first
              of which is scheduled for September,  1996.  After completion of the
              international planning  effort, an implementation plan for Ocean CLIVAR will be
               developed. ***
