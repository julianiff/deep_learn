Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT      The proposed work is an effort to use active feedback control to
              suppress free convection in the Rayleigh-Benard geometry.  In addition to
              raising the threshold for the onset of convection, an attempt will be made to
              stabilize chaotic convection, so that transient flow occurs at a higher Grashof
              number.  Distributed sensors, microactuators, and other MEMS technology will be
              used to provide the control.  The fundamental knowledge gained in this study is
              expected to be important for future applications in materials processing,
              casting, and crystal growth.
