Abstract    :
              9632680  Kahl    This initiative represents a timely new cooperative initiative 
              between the University of Maine and the Maine Department of  Environmental
              Protection (DEP). It will assess the statewide extent  and magnitude of surface
              water contamination from organic and  inorganic toxins, and provide a mechanism
              for creating further  cooperative research at the University, and between the
              University  and state agencies. To facilitate this collaboration, the 
              University will construct a clean room for processing samples with  trace
              concentrations of toxic substances, and install a high  resolution Gas
              Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer for trace organic  analysis.  The addition of
              an analytical chemist and support staff  will enhance long-term research
              interactions among University  researchers, industry and state agencies. Thus,
              this project is  ideally suited to the ESPCoR goal of improving long-term
              research  competitiveness.
