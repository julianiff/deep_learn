              of California Berkeley    Title:  Wireless Infrared LANs Using Multi-Beam
              Transmitters and Image Diversity Receivers      Abstract    This research will
              focus on the development of wireless Infrared Local area networks, as an
              economical high performance alternative to radio for many applications of short
              range wireless communications.  Two new components in wireless infrared links
              form the main focus of the research (1) multibeam transmitters and (2) imaging
              diversity receivers.  The transmitter, used in non-directed non-line of sight
              links, replaces the single wide beam of the diffuse transmitter by a collection
              of much narrower beams that are oriented different directions.  By  changing
              the path loss law from the fourth power of distance to the square of distance,
              the multibeam transmitter can dramatically reduce the transmitter power
              required in non-directed non-line of sight links.  The imaging diversity
              receiver will use a single optical concentrator such as a liens with a
              photodetector segmented into multiple pixels, each of which is connected to a
              separate preamplifier.  The imaging receiver will provide several key
              advantages over the non-imaging receiver: spatial discrimination of signal from
              noise, high optical gain over a wide field of view, and reduction of multipath
              delay spread and mitigation of co-channel interference.
