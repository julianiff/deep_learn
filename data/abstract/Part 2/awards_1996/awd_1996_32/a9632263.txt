Abstract    :
              ***  9632263  Xie   This STTR Phase I propject describes two novel designs for
              diode-pumped, compact, efficient, blue laser sources.  Such sources are needed
              in many applications including high density optical data storage, laser
              printing, and free space optical communication.  Presently, such compact and
              efficient sources are not commercially available for these applications. The
              designs described in this proposal are based on upconversion lasing in
              rare-earth doped fluorozirconate (ZBLAN) glass fiber.  The first is a Pr/Yb
              co-doped fiber which has previously been demonstrated as a laser operating at
              red, orange, green and blue wavelengths. The blue laser output power, however,
              was severely limited due to competing transitions from a common upper laser
              level. Our solution to the problem is described and will be tested and
              developed in this proposal. The second upconversion blue fiber laser to be
              developed in this proposal is based on Tm doped ZBLAN fiber. This laser has
              also been demonstrated, but lacks a convenient, scalable, diode-based pump
              source for commercialization. In this project, a novel and efficient pump
              source will be developed and demonstrated. Prototype laser systems for each of
              the two designs mentioned will be constructed and tested for future development
                 Potential applications are in the fields of optical data storage, printing
              applications, free space optical communications, optical display, spectroscopy,
              flow cytometry, molecular biology, high performance imaging, and semiconductor
              inspection.    ***
