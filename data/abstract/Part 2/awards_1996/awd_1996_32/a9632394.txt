Abstract    :
              Advances in multimedia computing technologies offer new approaches to the
              support of computer-assisted education and training within many application
              domains.  Novel interactive presentation tools can be built to enhance
              traditional teaching methods with more active learning. Since a variety of user
              interaction styles are possible, research must address the incorporation of
              such human interaction factors into presentation tools. Under this Research
              Planning Grant (RPG), the principal investigator conducts preliminary research
              into the impact of various quality-of-service (QoS) parameters on the various
              presentation tools that support interactivity functions necessary within
              digital libraries intended for education or training. The project explores and
              compares the benefits of various techniques designed to support such functions.
              The research activities include: (1) the identification of QoS parameters
              critical to the support of interactive learning and training activities; (2)
              preliminary experimentation with these parameters and candidate multimedia
              presentation methods; and (3) the construction of prototype applications to
              demonstrate the interactive capabilities of learning and tutoring tools.  A
              successful completion of these activities can lead to a more ambitious research
              plan to investigate interactive techniques for supporting on-line education-
              and training-oriented digital libraries.
