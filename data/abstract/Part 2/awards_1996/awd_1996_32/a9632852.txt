Abstract    :
              9632852  Burke  The shortgrass steppe (SGS) occupies the middle of the
              productivity gradient along which the LTER grassland sites lie. It is unique
              among North American grasslands for its long evolutionary history of intense
              selection by both drought and herbivory, leading to an ecosystem that is very
              well adapted to withstand grazing by domestic livestock. The distinctive
              features of the SGS are both its vegetation and the concentration of biological
              activity and organic matter belowground. The vegetation of the SGS is
              characterized by low-growing plants that are either tolerant or resistant to
              grazing and drought. The large concentration of biological activity belowground
              reflects the distribution of plant production and the enhanced rates of energy
              flow through heterotrophs belowground. It is also explained in part by the fact
              that most biologically active elements in grasslands are protected from natural
              disturbances by being stored in soil organic matter. The SGS LTER project has
              been in operation since 1982 and currently supports 46 long-term experiments,
              numerous short-term experiments, and has a large emphasis on integrative
              simulation analysis. SGS LTER work is divided into five major areas:
              populations and processes, biogeochemical dynamics, paleoecology and
              paleopedology, water and energy dynamics, and disturbances. In addition, the
              SGS is involved in many synthesis activities which will soon be summarized in a
              synthesis volume. One of the unique aspects of this research program is the
              emphasis on integrating knowledge about SGS ecosystems into simulation models.
              These models are used widely, and they will continue to serve as a mean of
              integrating ideas and developing hypotheses for future research in the SGS LTER
              program.
