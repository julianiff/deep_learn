Abstract    :
                Leaves are the primary photosynthetic organs on a plant and are critical to
              plant survival. Higher plants can have either simple or compound leaves and
              sometimes these two leaf types can occur in closely related species. Dr. Sinha
              will perform a gentic and molecular analysis of compound leaf development in
              tomato. She has cloned a homeobox containing cDNA, T6, from tomato. The T6
              clone maps close to two dominant leaf mutations, Mouse ears and Curl, both of
              which lead to excess leaf compounding. In situ hybridization experiments
              indicate that the T6 gene is expressed in developing leaf primordia and
              developing blade margins. Over expression of the cDNA in transgenic tomato
              results in excessively compounded leaves. Reduction of the T6 transcript causes
              formation of simple bladeless leaves. She has formulated an hypothesis for
              compound leaf morphogenesis in tomato based on existing leaf mutations. She
              will perform genetic crosses between Mouse ears, Curl and other existing leaf
              mutations to refine her hypothesis. These approaches should substantially
              increase our understanding of compound leaf development.
