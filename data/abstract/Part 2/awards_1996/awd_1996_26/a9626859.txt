Abstract    :
              9626859  Deng   The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in the
              Mathematical   Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for
              exchange of mathematical   scientists between academia and industry at
              different stages of their careers. These   programs will strengthen the links
              between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of
              research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Industry   Postdoctoral
              Research Fellowships provide two years of support for recent recipients of  
              doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. These awards are a means of
              contributing   to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation.
              The postdoctoral fellow will   work closely with scientific advisors from both
              academia and industry.   The postdoctoral fellow will work under the direction
              of Satoshi Hamaguchi at   IBM and Yuefan Deng at the State University of New
              York at Stony Brook. The research   concerns the study of deposition and
              etching of thin films, focusing on atomic scale   phenomena. This activity
              involves modeling and simulation. The use of parallel   computation is expected
              to improve the number and length of simulations to provide a   better
              understanding of the phenomena.
