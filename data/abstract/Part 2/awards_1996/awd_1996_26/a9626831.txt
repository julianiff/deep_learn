Abstract    :
                      This project focuses on developing algorithms for a variety of problems 
              in the theory and practice of scheduling and resource allocation.   The 
              project concentrates on: (i) developing improved approximation  algorithms for
              problems in combinatorial scheduling theory; (ii)  developing on-line
              algorithms for resource allocation; and (iii)  implementing and testing these
              algorithms.   In particular, the first  goal of the project is to develop
              general techniques for the design of  approximation algorithms for NP-hard
              scheduling problems.  These  techniques are based on several classes of integer
              programming  formulations, and they have already been applied to yield
              approximation  algorithms for average weighted completion time for a number of 
              constrained scheduling problems.   The second goal in this area is to  better
              understand, from the prospective of worst-case analysis, the  strengths of
              these general techniques.  The third goal is to investigate  approximation
              algorithms for multi-criteria scheduling problems.   The  fourth goal is to
              study on-line scheduling and resource allocation  questions, focusing initially
              on algorithms that provide good average  service to a stream of jobs, of
              different types and priorities, that  arrive over time.  The outcome of this
              study is expected to be:  (a) a better theoretical understanding of a number of
              models and  optimality criteria and (b) algorithms for a network of
              workstations and  modern parallel computers (such as the IBM SP2).***
