Abstract    :
              9626958  Claiborne    The Franklin Institute will develop a 6000 sq. ft.
              traveling  exhibit about "The Powers of Nature".  Focusing on earthquakes, 
              severe storms, and volcanoes, the exhibit will promote a greater  understanding
              of the meteorological and geological forces that  underlie these phenomena. 
              Visitors will also learn about how  scientists monitor and predict natural
              events, more about how these  natural events affect our lives, and critical
              safety measures that  people should take during these dangerous events.  The
              exhibit will  include a rich array of immersion experiences, hands-on
              interactive  activities, historical photographs, modern data and imagery, 
              artifacts, and personal stories.  An Educator's Guide containing  background
              information and classroom activities will be developed  and circulated in a
              printed publication as well as electronically  on the Franklin's WWW home page
              (Http:\\sln.fi.edu).  The exhibit  will open at the Franklin Institute in
              October, 1997 and will  circulate among the seven other science museums that
              are part of  the Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative.  It is estimated that
              2.5  million people will see the exhibit during its 42-month tour.
