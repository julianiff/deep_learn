Abstract    :
              9626154  Yan  The investigator studies incompressible flows governed by the 
              Navier-Stokes equations or Burgers' equation.  Some special  issues are studied
              in depth.  Various types of control objectives  (minimizing velocity tracking,
              drag, vorticity) and control  parameters (distributed control and boundary
              control) are  studied.  Long-time dynamics of controlled flows is the main 
              subject of this project.  The long-time behavior of  global-in-time and
              piecewise-in-time optimal controls are studied  in different settings. 
              Numerical schemes for computing the  control problems are designed and their
              performance is analyzed.   Effectiveness of control is analyzed for both
              continuous and  discrete systems; the latter is particularly close to the
              design  of practical control.  Numerical schemes are implemented to  evaluate
              the effectiveness of the control problems.  The  numerical results both
              reinforce the theoretical results and  reveal more quantitative information of
              the controlled dynamics.    Improving the design and control of modern aircraft
              can be  achieved through optimal design of wings, engines, etc, or  through the
              active control of air flowing over wings and into  engines.  The project
              studies issues basic to active control.   The investigator develops new
              mathematical and computational  tools that provide good engineering insight and
              practical design  criteria for controlling fluid motions in aerodynamic and 
              hydrodynamic systems.  This requires high performance  computational resources
              an order of magnitude greater than  typical modeling for uncontrolled flows. 
              Direct applications can  also be found in the design of submarine body shape
              and  propelling systems.
