Abstract    :
              9626342  Zaporozec  This is an award to support the Third USA/CIS Joint
              Conference on  Environmental Hydrology and Hydrogeology that will be held in 
              Tashkent, Uzbekistan from September 22-27, 1996.  This conference  will address
              environmental issues relating to the management of  water under varied
              geophysical settings but concentrating on  locations where water is scarce. 
              The conference is being  conducted under auspices of the American Institute of
              Hydrology  in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey and the Institute  of
              Water Problems of the Uzbekistan Academy of Sciences.  Membership an the U.S.
              organizing Committee includes  representation from the U.S. Geological Survey
              and the U.S.  Department of Agriculture.  Conference topics include hydrology 
              of arid regions, innovative water resource management concepts  and associated
              technologies.    This conference is organized to address problems of water 
              resource management especially those experienced by water  resource managers in
              geophysical locations characterized as being  arid or semi-arid.  Results of
              the conference are expected to  include identification of significant research
              needs water  quality protection, pollution prevention of both surface and 
              groundwater and the impacts of agricultural practices on water  quality.  ***
