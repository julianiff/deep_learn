Abstract    :
              9626287  Posbergh  This research project deals with the development of a design 
              methodology for robust stabilization and control of  nonlinear dynamical
              systems in uniform rotation. Typical  examples of such systems are rotating
              helicopter blades, gas  turbines, and spin stabilized spacecrafts. In recent
              years,  Lyapunov methods, coupled with developments in geometric  system
              theory, have provided powerful new tools for the  design of robust nonlinear
              feedback control systems. In this  research project, this methodology is
              modified to include a  special energy-momentum functional instead of a Lyapunov
               function, and the energy-momentum method of nonlinear  stability analysis is
              employed. By combining recently  developed methods of stability analysis with
              carefully  formulated structural models, a new class of nonlinear  feedback
              control laws are developed that fully exploit the  nonlinearities in the model.
              The use of high performance  computing, symbolic manipulation, and the
              development of  numerical design tools are emphasized in this research.
