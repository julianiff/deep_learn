Abstract    :
              Green's Function Monte Carlo (GFMC) is a powerful technique for calculating the
              ground properties of quantum systems.  A major limitation of this technique in
              the study of fermionic ground states is the "sign problem."  Over the past few
              years, Kalos has developed new techniques for eliminating the sign problem in
              fermion calculations.  This project will extend that approach to attack
              problems of interest in condensed matter physics and develop a parallel
              algorithm to carry out these calculations on the IBM  SP2.
