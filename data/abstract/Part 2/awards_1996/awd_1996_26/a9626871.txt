Abstract    :
              This three part research project to study the details of chemical vapor
              deposition processes is  supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program.  It is carried out in the  laboratory of Professor Nuzzo at the
              University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign.  New  methods are developed for the
              direct deposition of sub-micron structures, using a  combination of sol-gel
              chemistry, patterned metallization, and patterned catalyzed  polymerization. 
              Molecular beam deposition coupled with surface spectroscopic  characterization
              of adsorbed intermediates is used to characterize the details of the CVD 
              growth process.  Phase behavior in self assembled organic thin films forms the
              focus of the  third part of this project.  The results of this research are
              applicable to the developing  technologies of nanoscale fabrication and
              electronic device preparation.  Understanding the details of the synthesis and
              growth of thin films of electronically  interesting materials is the focus of
              this research project.  Self assembled organic overlayers,  sol-gel chemistry,
              and detailed kinetic studies of chemical vapor deposition combine to  provide
              the knowledge base essential to apply new thin layer growth methods to the 
              preparation of material microstructures.  Electronic device processing
              technologies are  impacted by this work.
