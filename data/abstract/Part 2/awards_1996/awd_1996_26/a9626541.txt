Abstract    :
              9626541  Olafsson    This proposal lies in the area of harmonic analysis on
              symmetric spaces. More specifically, it has to do with harmonic analysis and
              representation theory on causal symmetric spaces. The investigator plans to
              study Paley-Wiener theorems for the spherical  Laplace transform; causal
              compactification and the relation to Hardy spaces on tube domains; analytic
              continuation of unitary representations between dual real forms.    Causal
              symmetric spaces, and more generally, causal manifolds, are modeled after the
              space-time continuum. There are two distinguishing feature about causal
              symmetric spaces: a temporal orientation is defined on a causal manifold;
              symmetries preserving this temporal structure play a dominant role in studying
              them.
