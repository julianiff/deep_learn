Abstract    :
              9626698  Freed    This grant supports the global analysis and differential
              geometry group at the University of Texas at Austin. The proposed research
              concentrates on the analytic and algebraic aspects of mathematical physics.
              Research topics to be pursued include: Chern-Simons theory and the structure of
              topological quantum field theory; infinite dimensional integrable systems and
              nonlinear Schrodinger equations; symbolic dynamics and branched manifolds;
              geometrical structures in nonrelativisitic quantum mechanics. The project also
              includes educational activities involving undergraduate students and high
              school students.    Quantum field theory is an active area within theoretical
              and mathematical physics: ultimately, the researchers in this field hope to
              come up with a rigorous and unifying framework explaining various basic forces
              of nature. Integrable systems constitute an important subarea within the theory
              of dynamical systems - a dynamical system is given by a system of ordinary
              differential equations; in such a system the rate at which the system evolves
              over time is independent of time. Dynamical systems are used to model various
              natural phenomena such as population growth and weather systems.
