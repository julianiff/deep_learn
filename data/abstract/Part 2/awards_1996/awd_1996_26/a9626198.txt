Abstract    :
              9626198  Almgren    The investigator will continue his long term program of
              research on equilibrium and dynamic problems in the geometric calculus of
              variations, largely in the context of geometric measure theory.  The
              investigator plans to exploit his new general isoperimetric inequalities to
              obtain additional a priori estimates for a family of geometric evolution
              process problems.  In addition, the proposal includes a collaborative project
              on continuity properties of Steiner symmetrization and other rearrangements on
              function spaces.    A model problem for these studies is creation and analysis
              of geometric evolution processes including the growth of a crystal or
              polycrystal in various environments.  Possible applications of this research
              include better ways of controlling the sintering processes used in the
              manufacture of ceramic materials and coming up with an inventory of
              computer-aided design examples.
