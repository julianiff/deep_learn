Abstract    :
              9626307  Brady    A central issue in soft materials is the prediction of their 
              behavior  during  processing, especially  the  evolution  of  their structure
              during flow and/or chemical reaction.   With  the  increasing activity in this
              area of materials research,  there is a concomitant  increase  in  the   need
              for  instrumentation to  characterize the flow behavior of  polymeric and
              colloidal materials.    Research at the California Institute of Technology
              probes  a  wide range of complex fluids:  new biomedical materials, 
              mesostructured polymers, colloidal suspensions and polymer  solution-precursors
              of phase-inversion  membranes.  Development of materials for in-situ synthesis
              of biomedical  polymers demands measurement of rapid changes in the 
              viscoelasticity of reacting systems.  Establishing efficient  methods to
              control order in mesostructured polymers requires  simultaneous optical and
              mechanical characterization of  their flow behavior.  Testing current
              understanding of  colloidal suspensions depends upon precise measurements of 
              both the first and second normal stress differences, in  addition to the shear
              stress.  It is necessary to examine  the dynamics of all these systems under
              flow conditions that  include inception of shearing at a fixed rate, creep
              under  fixed shear stress, dynamic shearing, and superposed steady  and dynamic
              shear.  %%%  This grant provides funds for the purchase of two  rheometers: 
              one for experiments under controlled shear  strain and the other optimized for
              controlled stress and  strain experiments.  ***
