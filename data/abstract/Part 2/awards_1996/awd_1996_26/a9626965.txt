Abstract    :
              9626965  Barnes    How do we know the distance to a star?  How do we know what a
              star  is made of?  How do we know how fast an object is moving?  These 
              questions are addressed in this 1,488 square foot permanent exhibit  which
              emphasizes astronomical spectroscopy - the detailed analysis  of light from
              astronomical objects.  This interactive, bilingual  (English/Spanish) exhibit
              will demonstrate different applications  of spectroscopy that provide insight
              into the universe, and will  provide opportunities for students, teachers,
              parents, and the  general public to learn about the universe.  Bilingual
              ancillary  materials will be produced: pre- and post-visit materials for 
              school visitors; a "Life at an Observatory" ten-minute  orientation/information
              video to be shown at the visitor center.   Target audiences are students in
              grades K-12, and general visitors.
