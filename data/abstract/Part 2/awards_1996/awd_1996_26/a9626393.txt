Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at Grinnell College to acquire an
              upgrade of the computer and  operating system of an existing 300 MHz NMR
              Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance  research in a number of areas
              including the following: (1) Structural, equilibrium and kinetic  studies of
              platinum complexes, (2) Synthesis and electrochemical studies of polymeric
              materials,  (3) Novel reactions of organosilanes, (3) Preparation and
              characterization of compounds of  molybdenum (VI) and molybdenum (V), and (6)
              NMR study of low molecular weight molecules  in micelles.    Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  chemists
              for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify
              unknown  substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in
              solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists
              who are carrying out frontier research. The results from  these NMR studies are
              useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
