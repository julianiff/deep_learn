Abstract    :
              9626169  Ramachandran    This project deals with compact and complete Kahler
              manifolds and their topological properties, in particular, the fundamental
              group. The project is in the main motivated by the Shafarevich conjecture: Is
              the universal cover of every compact Kahler manifold holomorphically convex?
              This area of research interfaces several complex variables and algebraic
              geometry; uses techniques from analysis as well as geometry.    Kahler
              manifolds are a complex analog of Euclidean space. They arise in a variety of
              settings in mathematics as well as theoretical physics. For example, solutions
              to systems of polynomial equations with complex number coefficients are Kahler
              manifolds. Also, the space of all solutions to Yang-Mills type equations in
              elementary particle theory can be thought of as Kahler manifolds.
