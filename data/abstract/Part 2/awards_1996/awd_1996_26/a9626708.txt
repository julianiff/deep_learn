Abstract    :
              DMS-9626708  Ivo Herzog      This project concerns the connection between (1)
              the model theory of modules and (2) the use of functorial methods in the
              representation theory of rings.  In recent years this connection has been
              developed with an eye to algebraic applications of first order methods to
              modules, and in particular to artin algebras.  The present project will expand
              this approach to include the model theory of modules with an endomorphism, or
              equivalently - the model theory of modules over the ring of polynomials.  Also
              to be considered are (1) first-order variants of the Brauer-Thrall conjectures
              for an artin algebra, and (2) a theory of homology for positive-primitive
              formulas.    This research involves the connection between logic and algebra. 
              Logic provides the context in which one can study the expressive power of
              mathematical language; as such it is an essential tool in computing.  Algebra
              provides a vehicle for understanding notions such as symmetry and mappings, and
              finds application in sciences and manufacturing.  Professor Herzog's research
              takes place in a part of algebra called module theory, which is akin to, but
              broader than, linear algebra.  The problems which arise are similar to solving
              systems of linear equations.  By forging the relationships between logic and
              algebra, his research will provide new understanding of modules.
