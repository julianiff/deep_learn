Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF - Alfred P. Sloan Foundation  Postdoctoral Research
              Fellowship in Molecular Evolution.    Tradition holds that protein
              phosphorylation, a universal  mechanism for cellular regulation, evolved
              independently in  eukaryotes and prokaryotes.  The existence of protein 
              serine/threonine phosphatase in the prokaryotic archeon  Sulfolobus
              solfataricus challenges this notion.  This  proposal seeks to characterize the
              phosphorylation network  of S. Solfalarieus by identifying and characterizing
              its  phosphoproteins.
