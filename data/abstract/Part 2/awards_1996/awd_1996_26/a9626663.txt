Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division   of
              NSF, Professor Kenneth R. Fountain of Northeast Missouri State   University 
              will study the alpha effect, i.e. the rate enhancement in   nucleophilic
              substitution reactions deriving from the presence of a   second lone pair of
              electrons adjacent to the attacking pair on the   nucleophile.  The project
              lies within the NSF Program for Research in   Undergraduate Institutions.  The
              issue to be examined is the extent to   which single electron transfer (SET)
              models the reactivity in such   reactions.  Rates of transfer of alkyl groups
              from alkyldiarylsulfonium   salts to alpha or non-alpha nucleophiles will be
              measured.  Since the   sulfonium salts are amenable to electrochemical
              analysis,   structure-reactivity studies affording plots of log(rate) vs. redox
                potential can be constructed and the effect of SET capability deduced  
              therefrom.  Computations at the 3-21G** level, kinetic isotope effect  
              studies, and certain studies of symmetric substitutions expected to lead   to
              radical trapping, will also contribute to the project.  Study of nucleophilic
              substitutions, reactions well known to   undergraduate students of organic
              chemistry,  will provide understanding   of an effect of a certain structural
              change of the nucleophile on   reactivity.  The experimental work will be
              supported by computational   modeling.  The project design encourages students
              to view their   individual work in the context of a larger and overarching
              scientific   goal.
