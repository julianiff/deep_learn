Abstract    :
              9626846  Vanhoy  This research is a three-year program to study the structure of
               low angular momentum states in tellurium nuclei by inelastic  neutron
              scattering followed by gamma ray emission.  The research  involves
              undergraduate students from the U.S. Naval Academy and  utilizes facilities of
              the University of Kentucky Van de Graaff  laboratory in addition to those of
              the Naval Academy, and is a  collaboration with students and scientists from
              the University of  Dallas as well as the University of Kentucky.  ***
