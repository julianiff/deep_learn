Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to achieve direct alkynylation and   olefination
              of secondary and tertiary C-H bonds via the use of alkynyl   and vinyl
              triflones.  The research will attempt to define the mechanism   of the
              reaction, to develop enthalpy-matched reagents for regiospecific   alkynylation
              of complex substrates, to define appropriate protecting   groups to enable
              selective alkynylation of unactivated tertiary C-H bonds   in the presence of
              typically more reactive functional groups, to examine   the reactions of
              functionalized alkynyl triflones, to use optically   active acetals for the
              enantiospecific synthesis of acetylenic 1,3- and   1,2-diols, to seek seek
              alternate reagents for low temperature initiation   of the alkynylation
              reaction, to use the reaction to induce radical   cyclizations and
              fragmentations and to broaden the scope of the reaction   to include
              radical-mediated olefination, dienylation, allenylation and   allylation.  With
              this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting   the research of Dr.
              Philip L. Fuchs of the Department of Chemistry at   Purdue University. 
              Professor Fuchs will focus his work on developing   methodology by which to
              transform C-H bonds into C-C bonds.   Such   methodology, relying on reagents
              known as triflones, would provide   synthetic chemists with a powerful tool
              with which to modify organic   molecules.
