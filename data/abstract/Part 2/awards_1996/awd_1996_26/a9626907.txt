Abstract    :
              ***  Copeland  9626907         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project will develop a cost effective method of improving the efficiency of air
              conditioners. Air conditioners pump heat from a low temperature to a higher
              temperature where it is rejected to the environment. At design conditions, heat
              is removed from the room air and rejected to the environment at 95 F, cooling
              the room air from 77 F to 55 F. Even though the heat removal is non-isothermal,
              the evaporator of the conventional vapor compression cycle operates
              isothermally at a single, low temperature (45 F). If some of the heat from the
              room air were transferred to the refrigerant at a higher temperature (>45 F),
              the work needed to run the cycle would be reduced.  During this Phase II
              effort, conventional modern vapor compression air conditioners (i.e., pure
              fluid) will be modified to effectively remove heat from the room air at a
              higher average temperature. Like a conventional cycle, the modified cycle needs
              only one mechanical compressor; however, the power needed to compress the vapor
              is reduced. With HCFC-22, measurements during Phase I showed an 18% increase in
              COP (the theoretical limit was 23%). During Phase II, equipment will be
              developed for air conditioners in the range of 2 to 20 tons and the performance
              improvement will be demonstrated in a small scale (2 tons) air conditioner.    
                The innovative air conditioning cycle developed during this Phase II effort
              will improve the energy efficiency of both air conditioners and refrigerator
              units. The primary commercial market for the proposed system will be large
              scale, new installations in commercial office buildings and industrial
              refrigerators. Split cycle home air conditioners can also benefit from the
              improved performance of an ejector expansion cycle.  ***
