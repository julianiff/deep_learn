Abstract    :
              9626652  Greene    The proposed research deals with Riemannian as well as Kahler
              geometry. Orbifolds, spaces locally isometric to Riemannian manifolds
              quotiented by finite groups of isometries, are to be investigated with a view
              towards understanding the isometry groups of nonsingular Riemannian manifolds.
              Estimation of numbers of topological types for Riemannian manifolds satisfying
              certain geometric conditions will also be pursued. In Kahler geometry, the
              investigator will study how curvature behavior at large distances controls the
              overall complex structure of the space. This is the higher dimensional analog
              of distinguishing between hyperbolic and parabolic Riemann surfaces.    Much of
              this project has to do with how the local geometry, i.e., the geometric
              structure in small neighborhoods of each point, influences or even controls the
              global geometry and topology of a space, meaning the overall shape and nature
              of the space. This has a direct practical application in the construction of
              large-scale curved steel structure such as ship hulls. The deformation of steel
              plates by heat treatment into pre-specified curved shapes, for example, can be
              understood using this approach.
