Abstract    :
              9626371  McKittrick      The development of high brightness, thermally stable, 
              phosphor materials for display applications has become the  limiting step in
              the development of new flat panel displays  such as color plasma and field
              emission displays.  Phosphors  are luminescent materials when excited by an
              energy source  such as an electron beam or photons and are composed of an 
              inert host lattice with a small amount of dopant  (activator).  Most of the
              commercially available emissive  display phosphors have been developed for high
              voltage,  cathode ray tube applications which operate at 10-30 keV.  There has
              been very little work done on developing new  compositions for low voltage
              (100-10,000 eV) or plasma  displays (UV emission at 147 nm).  These new
              applications  have demands on phosphors that are not optimized or met by  the
              existing compositions.  This project is to build a multipurpose workstation for
              the  evaluation of cathodoluminescent and photoluminescent  materials for
              applications in CRT screens, field emission  devices and plasma displays.  The
              workstation will consist  of vacuum pumps, a vacuum chamber, a mass
              spectrometer, and  a spectroradiometer with associated electronics for the 
              evaluation of low and medium voltage cathodoluminescent  phosphors.  The UV
              evaluation will be performed by a  commercially available luminescence
              spectrophotometer.  %%%  Our research has focused on the synthesis of novel
              phosphor  powder compositions, the deposition of the powders to form  highly
              adherent, dense screens and the characterization of  the luminescent properties
              of these screens.  We have  concentrated our attention on understanding,
              modeling and  predicting the luminescent behavior to ultimately improve  the
              brightness, efficiency, and to decrease the emission  decay time of high
              voltage phosphor screens.  However, the  role of surfaces (point and line
              defects, absorbed species,  morphology, grain boundaries, etc.) is not
              understood on a  fundamental level.  Comparing the luminescent  behavior of 
              single crystals, powder screen and thin film phosphors will  yield basic
              information on the how photoemission is affected  by surfaces which in turn
              will aid in optimizing phosphor  screens for display applications.  ***
