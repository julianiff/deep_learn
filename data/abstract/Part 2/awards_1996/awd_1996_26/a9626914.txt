Abstract    :
                            Rosen  9626914      Professors Rosen and J. Hoffstein developed,
              some years ago, average   value theorems for Dirichlet L-series formed with
              quadratic characters  over rational function fields. Taking the special value
              at s=1 allows  one to derive average value theorems for class numbers of
              hyperelliptic  curves. If the constant field is a finite field with q elements,
              the  (q-1)'st roots of unity are in the base field. If l is a prime dividing 
              q-1, then every cyclic extension of the base field of degree l is a   Kummer
              extension. Therefore, it seems likely that one can average  Dirichlet L-series
              (and certain products of such series) formed with   characters of order l.
              Also, by taking the special values at s=1, one can   hope to derive class
              number averages as done in the quadratic case. Professor  Rosen has begun work
              on this project and published some promising results. He will work on a number
              of specific problems raised by these general considerations.     This research
              falls into the general mathematical field of Number Theory.   Number theory has
              its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers,   addressing such
              problems as identifying prime numbers and decomposing  whole numbers as
              products of primes. It is among the oldest branches of   mathematics and was
              pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the
              last half century it has become an indispensable tool in   diverse applications
              in areas such as data transmission and processing,   and communication systems.
