Abstract    :
              Keener  9626334       The investigator develops and uses mathematical models and
               tools to study the electrical activation of cardiac tissue.  The  two main
              interconnected emphases for this project are to develop  useful numerical
              algorithms to solve model equations on  physiologically realistic domains, and
              to use analytical and  numerical tools to study the dynamics of normal and
              reentrant  waves, their initiation, subsequent dynamics, and termination. 
              Particular emphasis is placed on the development of fast,  accurate, implicit
              numerical methods for integrating nonlinear  partial differential equations on
              irregular three-dimensional  domains.       The overall purpose of this
              research is to increase the  fundamental understanding of life-threatening
              cardiac  arrhythmias, their mechanisms and possible control.  To do so, 
              however, requires a substantial effort to develop and improve the  numerical
              algorithms for the efficient use of high performance  computing.
