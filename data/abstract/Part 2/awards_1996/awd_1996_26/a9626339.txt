Abstract    :
              DMS 9626339  Marshall     This research involves the study of life distributions
              from the  point of view of model selection.  One phase involves methods for 
              generating parameters in families.  Given a random variable with  distribution
              and survival functions, there are a number of ways  to impose parameters, in
              some instances by taking a function of  the random variable, and in some cases
              by taking a function of  the distribution or survival function.  The following
              are some  examples: (1) Location and scale parameters; (2) Frailty and 
              resilience parameters; (3) Power parameter; (4) Convolution  parameter (for
              special families such as the gamma family); (5)  Geometric-extreme stable
              parameter.  The investigators study  order relations for these parametric
              families.  For example, for  which parametric families are the hazard functions
              ordered; for  which families is there a stochastic or convex ordering.  The 
              introduction of parameters and their characteristics and their  orderings is
              fundamental to an insight concerning how to extend  the results to multivariate
              distributions.    Although the normal distribution plays a central role in many
               applications and in statistical theory, it does not serve as a  model for
              lifetime data arising in industrial applications such  as manufacturing data,
              materials data, reliability data, nor does  it serve as a model for survival
              analysis or risk analysis in the  health or environmental sciences.  This
              research focuses on how  to generate non-normal parametric families that will
              provide an  insight into behavior patterns and prediction for such data.  In 
              particular, the methods being developed serve to upgrade risk and  reliability
              analyses in engineering applications.  A second  stage in this research is the
              development of multivariate  versions that take account of dependencies among
              measurements.
