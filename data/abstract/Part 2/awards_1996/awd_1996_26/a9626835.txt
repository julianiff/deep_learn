Abstract    :
              This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)  project,
              supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,  focusses on the
              development of a standardized method for preparing  glycoprotein digests for
              subsequent structure analysis of  carbohydrate side chains using matrix
              assisted laser desorption  ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS).  This
              method will permit  structure determinations on samples more than one thousand
              times  smaller than is now possible and thereby enable analysis of  naturally
              occurring samples of limited size.  During the tenure of  this three year
              project, Professor Ronald Orlando and his students  at the University of
              Georgia will collaborate with industrial  partners at Hewlett Packard to
              develop this method and the software  with which to analyze the MALDI-MS
              results.  The data base of  carbohydrate structures that exists at the Complex
              Carbohydrate  Research Center at the University of Georgia will be used in this
               project.        The carbohydrate side chains of mammalian glycoproteins
              provide  functional control for many life processes.  The determination of  the
              structures of these side chains in naturally occurring  glycoproteins is
              limited by the sensitivity of existing methods.   Professor Orlando and his
              students at the University of Georgia  will collaborate with their industrial
              partners at Hewlett Packard  in developing a new mass spectrometric method for
              making these  measurements.  This project will provide a new analytical tool 
              which can be used to study the function of glycoproteins.
