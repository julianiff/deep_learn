Abstract    :
              9626370  Mitchell, Joseph S  SUNY @ Stony Brook    CISE Postdoctoral Program: 
              Efficient Geometric Algorithms in Support of Virtual Reality Systems (ES
              Postdoctoral Associate)    This award supports CES associate Claudio Silva. The
              goal of this project is to advance the state of the art in virtual environment
              systems by making use of methods of the field of computational geometry and the
              power of highly parallel computing architectures.  New efficient algorithms are
              being devised and implemented for critical geometric problems that arise in
              virtual environments and three-dimensional simulations, including collision
              detection, visibility/visualization, and mesh simplification.  A prototype
              software system is being written, incorporating new algorithms (sequential and
              parallel), and a library of efficient code for geometric primitives.  Special
              attention is being given to robustness and efficiency issues of the algorithms
              and implementations.  The impact of the project will be to advance the state of
              the art in virtual environment simulations, by increasing the complexity of the
              models that can be handled in real time.  ***
