Abstract    :
              9626806 Al-Shehbaz & Schnase The Flora of China is a collaborative project to
              publish, first in electronic and then in print format, the first modern
              English-language account of the approximately 30,000 species of vascular plants
              of China.  The print version of the Flora of China will comprise 25 volumes of
              text and illustrations that treat these species in a traditional format; the
              publication of the final volume in the series is not expected until the year
              2006.  However, in its electronic version, all the manuscripts for all the
              volumes will be available online via the WWW home page for the Flora of China
              by the end of this grant period (1998).  Thus, this information (metadata
              descriptors will be provided to indicate the level of review and editing of a
              given treatment at a given point in time) will be available for use by workers
              in basic and applied research, conservation, land management, horticulture,
              medicine, pharmaceutical chemistry, etc., much more rapidly than might have
              occurred in the past. Each treatment is co-authored by Chinese and American
              botanists and provided to the project headquarters electronically. Editorial
              functions will now be performed on the taxonomic treatments in their
              electronic-database form (with automatic capture of metadata about these
              activities); when all such functions are complete, an electronic "manuscript"
              can be extracted from the database, ready to go to the printer. The shift to
              electronic editorial procedures will both enhance (other workers in addition to
              the project's editors can contribute expertise to the process online) and
              accelerate (shipping of manuscripts among various editors and reviewers, even
              by anonymous ftp or e-mail will no longer be necessary) the entire process. 
              This project represents a step into the future of botanical science and
              international cooperation by the several supporting partners: the Chinese
              Commission of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and National
              Natural Science Foundation of China, and Bioti c Surveys & Inventories,
              Database Activities, and International Programs (China) of the US National
              Science Foundation, as well as several private foundations in the United
              States.
