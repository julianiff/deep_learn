Abstract    :
              DMS 9626108  Sun   This research involves the following non-parametric problems:
               BUMP HUNTING PROBLEMS, where tests  of unimodality  against multi-modality 
              and related estimators  are studied; CONFIDENCE BANDS for the mean response
              function  in generalized linear models; inferences in PROJECTION PURSUIT; and 
              RANDOM FIELDS, where the maxima of Gaussian random  fields  are studied using
              large deviations and techniques from  differential geometry.  All of these
              problems involve some nontrivial computations besides  methodology development
              and theoretical analysis. The investigator also studies efficient  algorithms
              and applies the techniques to air pollution data and other high dimensional and
              categorical data.  Modes or bumps in a density  estimate of a data set may
              reveal interesting structures of the data.  For example, in evolutionary
              biology they may indicate that a certain kind of species will be a dominating
              factor in stabilizing "natural selection", and in high-energy physics they may
              show the evidence of "partial-wave scattering amplitudes" or even a new
              particle. BUMP HUNTING techniques studied in this research help decide whether
              the modes or bumps are real features of the underline distribution of the data
              or simply a result of sampling fluctuation.  RANDOM FIELDS and GENERALIZED
              LINEAR MODELS can be used to model air pollution data and many other data. 
              PROJECTION PURSUIT is a powerful technique that searches for interesting
              structures of a  high dimensional data via lower dimensional projections. 
              Another  objective of the research is to determine the amount of confidence
              that may be attached to an estimate based on such techniques.
