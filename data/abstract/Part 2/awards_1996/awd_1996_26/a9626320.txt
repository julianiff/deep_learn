Abstract    :
              9626320  Ward    Advances in materials science require detailed 
              characterization of the structure and composition of  materials.  Consequently,
              x-ray diffraction continues to  play a vital role in the synthesis, fabrication
              and  characterization of advanced materials and in materials  processing.  This
              award provides support for an  x-ray  diffraction system to be housed in the
              University of  Minnesota X-ray Diffraction Facility.  X-ray diffraction is  an
              integral part of numerous University research programs  related to materials
              research, and the Facility has actually  served eighteen different
              universities, at least fourteen  industrial research laboratories and programs
              affiliated  with the National Science Foundation's Center for  Interfacial
              Engineering.  The requested equipment will  replace an aging Siemens
              diffractometer which poses safety  hazards and has performance limitations. 
              The system  represents a significant improvement in the Facility's 
              capabilities, providing a rotating anode source for faster  sample throughput
              (imperative for a multi-user facility),  and control of sample environment. 
              This acquisition will  substantially benefit several key principal
              investigators  whose research programs involve materials research, as well  as
              a substantial user community composed of academic and  industrial scientists.
