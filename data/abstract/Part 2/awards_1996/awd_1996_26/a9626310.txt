Abstract    :
              9626310  Li    The proposed research deals with harmonic functions, and more
              generally, harmonic maps. Three related topics are to be pursued: harmonic maps
              between Hadamard manifolds, harmonic maps from possibly singular algebraic
              varieties, and harmonic functions on complete manifolds. In particular, the
              investigator aims to work on the following conjecture due to Yau: the set of
              harmonic functions of k-th order polynomial growth, for any non-negative
              integer k, must be of finite dimension on a manifold with non-negative Ricci
              curvature.    Harmonic functions appear as components of complex-valued
              analytic functions; as such they have a rich structure theory. In applications,
              they arise as solutions to various classical partial differential equations,
              and can be used to describe the heat flow on a lamina, tension and
              area-minimizing surface configurations, and so forth.
