Abstract    :
              9626585  Schafrik   This grant provides funding to the National Academy of
              Sciences for a study that will identify those fundamental manufacturing
              challenges that cut across multiple industry sectors and that, if successfully
              addressed, could result in major departures from current approaches by the 2010
              time frame.  The most important enabling technologies that would contribute to
              overcoming the visionary challenges will be described as they differ by
              industrial sector.  The study will take an international perspective by
              obtaining input from manufacturing companies in Europe, Asia, Canada, and
              Central and South America, and it will draw on information being developed
              through the National Science Foundation's Next Generation Manufacturing
              project.  The Next Generation Manufacturing project is establishing an industry
              consensus for a 10-year vision by industrial sector.     This effort will
              supplement other efforts on the Next Generation Manufacturing project and
              leverage its results.  It will provide guidance to the Foundation and other
              government agencies to help direct their funding and research efforts aimed at
              improving the competitiveness of the nation's manufacturing capacity.
