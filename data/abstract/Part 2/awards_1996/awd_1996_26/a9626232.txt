Abstract    :
              9626232  Croke    The proposed research lies in the area of Riemannian Geometry.
              More specifically, the investigator plans to study the induced action of
              fundamental groups on the boundary of the universal covering space of manifolds
              of non-positive curvature; to pursue spectral rigidity problems for compact
              manifolds of negative sectional curvature; to continue his study of
              isoperimetric inequalities.    Riemannian manifolds are an abstraction of
              spaces possessing a notion of distance. These are abstract spaces in that a
              Riemannian manifold does not have to sit inside an ambient space, unlike curves
              and surfaces in 3-space. The overall shape of such a space is then determined
              by its so called topology as well as the distance function. The proposed
              research has to do with understanding this interaction between the topology and
              distance function.
