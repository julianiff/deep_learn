Abstract    :
              DMS 9626159  Vidakovic  This research connects recent theoretical advances in
              both nonlinear wavelet shrinkage theory and Bayesian statistical wavelet
              modeling to time series measurements of stochastic phenomena.  The researchers
              study:  (i)  cost measures that serve as criteria for the best wavelet basis
              selection, (ii)  statistical models in the wavelet domain that range from
              Hilbert space projections to coherent Bayesian models, and (iii)  the model
              induced shrinkage in the wavelet domain.  It is demonstrated that wavelet
              regression and density estimation are excellent tools in denoising and
              parsimonious description of complex dynamic processes, such as turbulence.  The
              turbulence  measurements are characterized by  local ``bursts'' in  time and
              frequency domains are providing an ideal media for testing shrinkage methods,
              best basis choice, and wavelet modeling. The existence of power laws,
              consistent with Kolmogorov's K41 theory is used to assess the proposed
              shrinkage methods.    Wavelets are novel building blocks and excellent
              descriptors of many complex phenomena in a variety of scientific fields.  This
              research applies wavelets to an important and omnipresent phenomenon arising in
              hydrology and atmospheric science:  the turbulence.  Recent theoretical
              advances in statistical modeling and estimation are combined with the power of
              several intrinsic properties of wavelets to produce superb tools for modeling,
              denoising, and analyzing complex turbulence measurements.
