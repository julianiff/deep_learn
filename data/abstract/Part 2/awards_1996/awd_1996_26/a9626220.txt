Abstract    :
              9626220  Shiota    The Sound to Mountains exhibit showcases contemporary and
              emerging  watershed issues which affect the Pacific Northwest region.  This 
              exhibit addresses the need to focus awareness on non-point  pollution for the
              general public and among Washington State  teachers and school children (K-12).
               This represents one of the  major pollution problems affecting the greater
              Puget Sound region.   A school curriculum and visitation program will be
              developed, along  with a Watershed Wonders kit.  The components of the Sound to
               Mountains exhibit include: a freshwater self-discovery laboratory;  a lowland
              waters replication; a life-like conservation trail; an  upland mountain stream
              habitat; and a carved and painted mural  depicting the First People story of
              salmon.
