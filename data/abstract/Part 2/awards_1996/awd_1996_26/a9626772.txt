Abstract    :
              ***  9626772  Saeed  The objective of this study is to investigate
              experimentally  and theoretically the short-term and long-term behavior of 
              columns made from pultruded fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP)  materials.  The
              slenderness ratios of these columns will be  selected so that both modes of
              failures, global buckling and  local buckling will be investigated in this
              study.  In the experimental investigation, full-scale specimens will  be
              prepared from commercially available pultruded sections.  The experimental work
              will be conducted in two phases.  In  the first phase, 32 different specimens
              will be prepared from  wide flange and structural tubing sections, and they
              will be  loaded to failure by means of a concentric axial load.  In  the second
              phase of this program, 24 specimens made of  similar sections used in Phase I
              will be loaded axially for a  period of 10,000 hours.  The sustained loads will
              be  calculated based on 40%, 50%, and 60% of the ultimate loads  obtained in
              the first phase of the study.  Based on the experimental findings and on basic
              stability  theory and anisotropic materials, a unified limit state  design
              criteria for FRP columns will be developed.  Guidelines and code-like design
              provisions will be suggested  as an initial Load and Resistance Factor Design
              (LRFD) method  similar to that which has recently been developed for timber, 
              cold-formed steel, and masonry structures.***
