Abstract    :
                      This action funds an NSF - Alfred P. Sloan Foundation  Postdoctoral
              Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution.    The genes coding for proteases
              and/or beta galactosidases  from Antarctic bacteria which are enzymatically
              active at  temperatures below 10C will be compared with homologous  enzymes
              from closely related bacteria (based on 16S-rRNA  gene sequences) found at
              "normal" temperatures.  Changes in  the amino acid sequence of the enzymes that
              confer low  temperature activity can then be inferred, leading to a  greater
              understanding of the strategies and mechanisms of  adaption to cold
              environments at the molecular level.
