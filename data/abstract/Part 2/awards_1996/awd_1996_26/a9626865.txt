Abstract    :
              Billard    The proposal requests support for fifteen U.S-based individuals from
              academic and nonprofit institutions to participate in the Workshop on
              Statistical Image Analysis to be held in Sydney, Australia, July 9-12, 1996. 
              The workshop will be held in conjunction with the Sydney International
              Statistical Congress.  About one-third of those supported will be those with an
              official capacity and two-thirds will be new researchers, especially those
              traditionally underrepresented groups such as women and minorities. 
              Availability of awards will be advertised in publications of the ASA, the IMS
              and the Biometric Society.  Awardees will be selected by an Awards Selection
              Committee.
