Abstract    :
              9626949  Davidson    The Museum of Science in Boston will develop an exhibit and
              other  interactive activities "Messages".  This is about communication.   The
              focus of the visitor's experience will be exploring the many  facets of human
              and animal communication including linguistics,  psychology, sociology,
              sociobiology, cybernetics, information  theory, and telecommunications.  The
              activities will improve  visitors general science literacy by helping them
              understand the  nature of communication both as a subject that encompasses many
               scientific disciplines and as a scientific thinking skill.  Three  themes will
              be developed 1) Communication is an integral part of  being alive; 2) The modes
              and media of community are many; and 3)  Communication requires a sender and a
              receiver.  In addition to the  1200 sq. ft. core exhibit, the museum will
              develop related kiosks  that will be placed at various locations throughout the
              museum,  public programs, and Internet-based activities.  It will be  designed
              for universal accessibility and is intended for a diverse  audience with
              special attention to youngsters and people with few  technological skills. 
              Materials developed for teachers and  students will address the Communication
              basic technology area  recommended in Science For All Americans.  Special
              emphasis will be  placed on linking the content and formal educational and
              take-home  materials with Project PALMS, the NSF State Systemic Initiative in 
              Massachusetts.
