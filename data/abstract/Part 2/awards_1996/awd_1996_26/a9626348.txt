Abstract    :
              DMS 9626348  Samarov  This research addresses the question of how intuitive and
              concise  linear model concepts and techniques can be extended to  nonparametric
              settings.  Nonparametric counterparts of such  commonly used linear model ideas
              as regression  coefficients,  correlation coefficients, coefficient of
              determination, and  principal components are considered.  The research also
              studies  nonparametric techniques for model diagnostics that can be used  for
              dimensionality reduction and to address the question of  adequacy of particular
              models.  Both asymptotic and finite sample  properties are studied, and the
              problem of developing reliable  data-based methods for smoothing parameter
              selection for  functionals and curves is addressed.  With the advent of
              computer data bases of unprecedented size and  complexity and with the dramatic
              increase in computer power, it  as become increasingly more desirable and
              possible to develop  more flexible models, concepts, and procedures that can be
              used  to study relationships between variables and to construct models  without
              relying on rigid global assumptions.  Much of the recent  work in statistics
              have addressed this need for more general and  flexible methods.  This research
              further extends this work with a  special focus on procedures that are
              counterparts of many  commonly used linear model concepts and that expose
              important  features in the data using intuitive and familiar ideas.
