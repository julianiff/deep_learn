Abstract    :
              Computing increasingly involves interactions between autonomous  and
              heterogeneous agents distributed throughout a network, agents  that have been
              designed separately, by different people, with  little, if any, knowledge of
              each other.  For such disparate  agents to work safely and harmoniously
              together, they must be  able to trust each other to observe certain unifying
              principles  and protocols.  Unfortunately, in such an open system one cannot 
              expect universal  voluntary compliance with any given principle.  If required,
              such a principle must be  imposed on all components  of a given system.  A
              flexible, scalable, and fault tolerant  mechanism for imposing such principles
              and protocols over open  groups of distributed agents is being developed under
              this  project.  This mechanism, implemented as a toolkit called Moses,  is
              based on the concept of law-governed interaction (LGI), under  which all
              messages exchanged between the members of a given group  of agents are governed
              by an explicit, declarative, and locally  enforced set of rules, called the law
              of this group.  Some of the  the potential applications of LGI are being
              explored.  ***
