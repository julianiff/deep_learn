Abstract    :
              9626537  Scott       Scott plans to continue work on his book on the theory of 
              3-manifolds.  He also intends to explore further some recent work done  jointly
              with G. A. Swarup of the University of Melbourne, Australia.  They  have found
              an algebraic version of the Annulus Theorem from the theory of  3-manifolds,
              and there are several different directions of inquiry that  they plan to
              pursue.  Their ideas involve new applications of some  earlier work of Scott
              and are closely related to important work in  the theory of 3-manifolds and in
              geometric group theory.  These ideas  should simplify some difficult recent
              work of other authors and prove new  results that have been impossible to prove
              with the available techniques.       The theme of this project is the close
              connection between  certain types of geometry and group theory.  It brings
              together ideas of  several authors in these different areas that at first
              seemed to apply  only in special situations but are now being seen to be
              connected and to   have much more general applicability.  ***
