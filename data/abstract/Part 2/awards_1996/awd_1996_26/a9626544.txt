Abstract    :
              9626544  Lawrence       The Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT) family of quantum
              invariants of  3-manifolds was defined only as a family of discrete invariants
              dependent  on a parameter that can be any root of unity.  This project aims to
              study  the extension of this invariant to a holomorphic function of the
              parameter.  Following work of Murakami, Ohtsuki, Rozansky and the Principal 
              Investigator, it is currently possible to define such an extension only for 
              specific manifolds.  The goal of the project is to understand better the 
              relationship between this function, specific values that it takes, its 
              asymptotic expansion, and a combinatorial description of the geometry and 
              topology of the original manifold.  This should lead to combinatorial  formulae
              for finite type 3-manifold invariants, generalizations of the  Casson
              invariant, as well as a discretization of the Chern-Simons-Witten  Feynman
              integral and comparisons with the Kontsevich integrals.       Although much is
              known about the so-called quantum family of  invariants of knots and links in
              three dimensions, which are generally  polynomial functions of a complex
              parameter, the same is currently not true  for their 3-manifold counterparts. 
              From the few known results on these  functions, they are seen to have
              intriguing number theoretic properties,  the investigation of which is the
              subject of this project.  These  invariants also have a formulation as a
              Feynman integral, and it is hoped  that this project will contribute to the
              better understanding of Feynman  integrals in general, which currently sit on a
              not entirely rigorous  foundation.  ***
