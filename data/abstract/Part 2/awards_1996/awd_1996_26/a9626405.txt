Abstract    :
              9626405  Ilmanen    The proposed research lies in the general area of Riemannian
              geometry. More precisely, it deals with the following geometric evolution
              equations: the Ricci flow, mean curvature flow, and Yang-Mills heat flow
              equations. The methods to be used include geometric measure theory, blowup
              arguments, nonlinear elliptic equations, minimal surfaces, and computer
              solutions of variational problems.    Geometric evolution equations arise in
              the description of physical processes, and at the same time they are
              interesting from a purely geometric standpoint. They can be used to describe
              various heat flows, long time fluid dynamics, and other phenomena in nature
              where the change occurs gradually and continuously over time.
