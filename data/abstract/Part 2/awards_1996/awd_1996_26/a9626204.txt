Abstract    :
              9626204  Akbulut       This project has two parts, (a)topology of smooth
              4-manifolds and  (b)topology of real algebraic sets.  In (a) the investigator
              intends  to construct some new 4-manifolds (such as manifolds with b+ even, and
              a  product of spheres) by using the new Seiberg-Witten technology and by  some
              new algebraic topological techniques (torsion invariants for  4-manifolds).  He
              would also like to use symplectic/contact structures  to get a better structure
              theorem for smooth manifolds (i.e., generalized  "cork" structures).  In (b) he
              intends to continue with the "topological   classification program" previously
              initiated jointly with H.King.  He will also try to construct submanifolds of
              Euclidean space that  cannot be isotopic to a nonsingular algebraic subset
              (i.e., strongly   transcendental manifolds).       The investigator would like
              to construct some new exotic 4-dimensional  manifolds (generalizations of
              4-dimensional spaces) that have not been  detected by the current techniques. 
              He also would like to classify  "algebraic spaces" (spaces that are described
              by systems of polynomial  equations).  The mysteries of 4-dimensional geometry
              and topology have  been recognized as of more than purely theoretical interest
              ever since  the acceptance of time as a fourth physical dimension, e.g., in 
              Einstein's theory of special relativity in the early years of this  century.
