Abstract    :
              9626344  Vitek    This study is a combined, experimental and theoretical 
              project on mechanisms of plastic deformation in titanium  aluminide, TiAl.  The
              experimental portion is used as input  for the theoretical portion and vice
              versa.  The objectives  of the study are to fully characterize and identify the
               deformation modes in polysynthetically twinned single  crystals and in
              lamellar polycrystals of TiAl-based alloys,  to show how deformation is
              transmitted across the various  types of boundaries (including domain and grain
              boundaries),  and to determine the sources of the dislocations and twins.  The
              experimental techniques to be employed are mechanical  tests on single crystals
              and polycrystals, followed by  characterization of the deformation modes using
              optical,  atomic force, and transmission electron microscopy.  The  theoretical
              program involves atomistic modeling of  dislocation core structures,
              interfacial reactions, and  twinning processes, using a variety of interatomic 
              potentials.  The potentials to be used are the embedded atom  and/or
              Finnis-Sinclair type, as well as quantum mechanically-  based bond order
              potentials.  The development of new  interatomic potentials for use in this
              non-cubic structure  will be an important part of the program, as will the 
              development of new experimental techniques for the  determination of
              deformation modes.  %%%  The results of the study are expected to be of great
              utility  in understanding how, and under what circumstances, low  symmetry
              materials can be toughened.  Furthermore, it could  show what techniques might
              be used to toughen intermetallic  compounds.  ***
