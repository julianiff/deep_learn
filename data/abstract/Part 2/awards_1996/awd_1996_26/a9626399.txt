Abstract    :
              9626399  Shayman    Discrete systems are systems that involve quantities which
              take  on a discrete set of values and which are constant except at  discrete
              times when events occur in the system.  Examples include  communication
              networks, intelligent vehicle highway systems,  manufacturing systems and
              computer programs.  Supervisory control  theory was developed to provide a
              mathematical framework for the  design of controllers for such systems in order
              to meet various  constraints.  The majority of the research effort in this area
               has focused on the supervisory control of deterministic systems.   However,
              unmodeled dynamics or partial observation often leads to  {\it nondeterministic
              models} in which knowledge of the current  state and next event is insufficient
              to uniquely determine the  next state.  Distributed systems commonly have
              nondeterministic  models.  The research program described in this proposal is 
              intended to extend supervisory control theory so that it can  accommodate
              technical issues that arise in the automation of  fault management for
              communication networks. These include, among  others, the effects of a
              distributed plant on the information  available to the supervisor as well as
              tradeoffs between the  effectiveness of control and the cost of information.
              The latter  is especially important for network management since the 
              information gathering process of monitoring the network elements  diverts
              network resources from the primary task of data transfer.  ***
