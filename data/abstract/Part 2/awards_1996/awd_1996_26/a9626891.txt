Abstract    :
              Abstract  Dai  9626891    This award will partially support a conference at the
              University of North Carolina at Charlotte that will focus on the theory of
              wavelets from an operator theoretic view point.  This is a very recent
              development in what is itself a very young subject.  The participants will
              include investigators for Texas A & M and Washington University who are among
              the leaders in the area.    The basic idea in the theory of wavelets is to
              represent a given function - say a radar signal - as a combination of basis
              functions belonging to a specified set with well known analytic properties.  By
              choosing the correct basis functions, one hopes to get a good approximation of
              the given function by just a few basis functions.  In this case, the function
              can be described well by just a few non zero coefficients.
