Abstract    :
              9626295  Hansen    The Webb Institute requests support from NSF for connection
              to NYSERNet.  NYSERNet, a midlevel network in New York, will provide operations
              management and information services and it will give the Institute access to
              the Internet, a collection of interoperable networks connecting most research
              and education organizations in the United States.    The Institute needs the
              Internet connections to be able to access information resources throughout the
              state, the nation and the world.  The connection will benefit the faculty,
              staff students of the Webb Institute as well as the community in general.
