Abstract    :
              9626111  Hatcher       The two investigators will continue their research into
              homological  properties of automorphism groups of free groups, in particular,
              to  determine whether there is nontrivial rational homology in the stable 
              dimension range and whether these automorphism groups are virtual duality 
              groups.  The homotopy type of related complexes on which the automorphism 
              groups act, for example the complex of free factors of a free group, will  also
              be investigated.  Another problem which will be studied is to  determine the
              homotopy type of the space of all embeddings of a link in  3-space, extending
              known results for knots.  In particular, it should be  possible to answer
              Kontsevich's question whether this space has finite  homotopy type.       In
              more general terms, this involves determining all the essentially  different
              ways of removing unnecessary tangles from a knotted piece of  string or from
              several pieces which are knotted and linked together.  With regard to the other
              part of the project, automorphisms of free  groups play a fundamental role in
              group theory (the general study of  symmetry) somewhat analogous to matrices in
              linear algebra, and the goal  is to understand just how close this parallel is:
               When one takes a  geometric view of both sorts of algebraic objects, is the
              picture  qualitatively the same, or qualitatively different?  ***
