Abstract    :
              9626561  Meyerhoff       Recent work of D. Gabai indicates that certain
              fundamentally  important open problems in 3-manifold theory will be solved if
              an  appropriate understanding of solid tube neighborhoods around short 
              geodesics in hyperbolic 3-manifolds can be developed.  For example, if  it can
              be shown that sufficiently large solid tube neighborhoods can  be found in any
              hyperbolic 3-manifold, then it would follow that  closed (irreducible)
              3-manifolds that are homotopy equivalent to  closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds are
              themselves hyperbolic.  This project  has as its goal to gain a deep
              understanding of solid tubes in  hyperbolic 3-manifolds and to apply this
              understanding to fundamental  problems in 3-manifold theory.  The methods
              employed involve  parametrizing the possible ways that shortest geodesics can
              sit in  hyperbolic 3-manifolds and then analyzing the resulting parameter 
              space by means of rigorous computer programs.  This work is joint with  D.
              Gabai and N. Thurston.       In the late 18th century, Henri Poincare pioneered
              the study of  3-manifolds.  One of his best methods was to analyze all loops in
              the  3-manifold in question; in particular, he studied the so-called  
              fundamental group of the 3-manifold.  Poincare's general question was,   if I
              understand the fundamental group, do I thereby understand the  3-manifold
              completely?  (The infamous Poincare Conjecture is a  specific instance of this
              general question.)  In the late 1970's and  early 1980's, William Thurston
              revolutionized the study of 3-manifolds  by showing that most 3-manifolds have
              hyperbolic structures  (hyperbolic geometry is the most important non-Euclidean
              geometry).  This leads to a natural and important Poincare type question: If a 
              compact (irreducible) 3-manifold has the same fundamental group as a  compact
              hyperbolic 3-manifold, must it be a hyperbolic 3-manifold as  well?  The goal
              of this project is to answer this question in the  affirmative.  The method is
              to reduce the question to an analysis of a   certain region in a 6-dimensional
              space that is related to solid tubes  around shortest geodesics in hyperbolic
              3-manifolds.  The plan is to  break this region up into about a billion
              sub-boxes and to deal with  each of these sub-boxes separately.  Naturally,
              this involves the use  of a (rigorous!) computer program.  ***
