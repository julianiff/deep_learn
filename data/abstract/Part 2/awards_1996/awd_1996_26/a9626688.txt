Abstract    :
              9626688  Klain    This proposal lies in the area of convexity and integral
              geometry. The investigator plans to work on the theory of mixed volumes with a
              view towards characterizing valuations (valuations include all elementary mixed
              volumes) and set functions invariant under various group actions. This is an
              extension of Hadwiger's theorem for the elementary mixed volumes. Hadwiger's
              theorem classifies all continuous valuations on convex bodies that are
              invariant under rotations and translations.    A central question in integral
              geometry is to find a formula for the volumes of various combinations of a
              given set of convex bodies whose volumes are already known. Coefficients
              arising in such a formula are called mixed volumes. The proposed research
              attempts to compute mixed volumes in various special cases; consider
              applications to probability theory and integral geometry.
