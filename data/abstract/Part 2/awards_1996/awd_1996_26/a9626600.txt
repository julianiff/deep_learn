Abstract    :
              Fukuta/Abstract           Cirrus clouds often consist of polycrystalline ices,
              bullet-  rosette in particular, and play an important role in the earth's 
              radiative balance.  Using a wedge-shaped ice thermal chamber and a  continuous
              flow, horizontal gradient, ice-thermal diffusion  chamber, the supersaturation
              temperature-polycrystalinity of formed  ice crystals relationship and the
              growth of the polycrystalline ice  will be studied with natural aerosol
              particles and pure water for  the temperature down to about negative 38.5
              degrees Celsius.         Cirrus crystals frequently form out of supercooled
              clouds, and  the vapor pressure of supercooled water is an important indicator 
              for the phase equilbria and the phase change kinetics.  Yet, the  presently
              available data are extrapolated from those at higher  temperature.  Using the
              wedge-shaped ice thermal diffusion chamber  with pure water droplets either
              free floating or supported on a  nylon thread in the middle along the
              isothermal plane, and  examining and comparing their growth/evaporation
              behaviour with the  computed value, the vapor pressure of supercooled water
              will be  determined for temperatures down to about negative 38.5 degrees 
              Celsius and compared with the present table values.
