Abstract    :
              9626911  Kleiner    The proposed research lies in the interface amongst group
              theory, differential geometry, dynamics and topology, stemming from the study
              of negatively curved surfaces. More specifically, the investigator is
              interested in relations between a discrete group and the large scale structure
              of its Cayley graphs, and applications of these to geometric and dynamical
              problems involving negatively curved surfaces.    In mathematics as well as in
              physics and chemistry, groups are often used to describe various symmetry
              properties. Discrete groups are finite, hence, objects that can be written down
              rather explicitly. The fundamental group of a curved space is a group carrying
              information about large scale symmetries of the space; this group turns out to
              be discrete in many cases.
