Abstract    :
              9626119  Coppersmith    This new award focuses on the theory of the dynamical 
              properties of inhomogeneous condensed matter systems.  In  particular, emphasis
              is on the nonequilibrium dynamics of  granular materials and of collective
              motion in driven  disordered systems such as flux lattices in type-II 
              superconductors and sliding charge density waves.  Recent  experimental work on
              these systems has revealed rich  dynamical behavior that may be amenable to
              detailed  theoretical understanding.  The research goal is to  understand both
              the deterministic and noisy response of  these systems and to identify unifying
              physical principles  that may be applicable to a broad range of complex
              systems.  %%%  This new award focuses on the theory of the dynamical
