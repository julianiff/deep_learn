Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              (CRIF) will  assist the Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania State
              University acquire an atomic force  microscope (AFM). This equipment will
              enhance research in a number of areas including the  following: (1) structure,
              dynamics, and physical properties of inorganic monolayers; (2) self-  assembly
              of monolayers for application in bio-interfaces and nano-electronic devices;
              (3)  electron-beam-induced chemistry in self-assembled monolayers with
              applications to lithography;  (4) nucleation and growth studies of
              poly(methylene) clusters via Au-surface catalyzed  decomposition of
              diazomethane; (5) surface orientation effects in ultrathin polyimide films; (6)
               composite layer structures based on self-assembled noble-metal colloid
              monolayers; (7) T4  replication system as a model for DNA replication; (8)
              nanometer-scale structure in both  continuous and discontinuous Au surfaces and
              (9) comparisons of the tunable microwave  frequency AC scanning tunneling
              microscope (ACSTM) and AFM images.      The atomic force probe microscope (AFM)
              enables researchers to image atoms directly. The  technique uses the
              piezoelectric effect which involves bringing an extremely sharp metal needle 
              within a few angstroms of the sample surface. The distance is small enough for
              electrons to leak  or tunnel across the gap and generate a minute current. As
              the gap between the tip and the  sample increases, the current decreases. As
              then probe crosses the sample, moving back and  forth across its surface, it
              traces out a contour map of the sample's surface atoms. The AFM is  used in the
              control of material used to fabricate semiconductor circuits.
