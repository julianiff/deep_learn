Abstract    :
              This starter grant award to Texas A&M will support the research of   Professor
              Cynthia M. Dupureur.  The theme of the research is the   relationship of
              structure and function in restriction enzymes.  Studies   focus on EcoRI
              restriction endonuclease.  While the structure of the   enzyme is known, the
              position and thus role of the N-terminal arm is   crystallographically
              undefined.  In this research, the relationships   among the required N-terminal
              arm and the rest of the enzyme, metal ions,   and substrate are investigated
              using peptide synthesis, spectroscopy,   metal ion binding assays, and
              non-covalent reconstitution experiments.    Information obtained leads to
              elucidation of the relationships among   these reaction components, as well as
              to clarification of working models   of EcoRI activity.  This research will
              advance the fundamental understanding of restriction   enzymes essential for
              development of chemotherapeutics that target   nucleic acids.
