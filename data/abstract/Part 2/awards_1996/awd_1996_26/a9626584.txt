Abstract    :
              Dietterich                           Understanding and Scaling-Up Machine
              Learning Algorithms  Several machine learning algorithms have become very
              popular and widely used -- particularly the top-down partitioning algorithms
              for decision trees and the backpropagation algorithm for feed-forward neural
              networks.  This  research seeks to deepen our understanding of these
              algorithms, to explain why various boosting and voting techniques improve their
              accuracy, and to determine the best procedures for applying them in practice. 
              A second goal of the research is to find ways of scaling up these algorithms
              (and their associated boosting techniques) to handle problems with billions of
              training examples and thousands of output classes.  Based on our experience
              with voting algorithms, we will develop methods for reducing the cost of
              voting, scaling up the number of output classes, handling continuous output
              values, and handling large numbers of training examples.  Existing learning
              algorithms have been designed for conditions where data is very expensive and
              computer time is relatively cheap.  Emerging applications in data mining
              exhibit the opposite conditions: data is voluminous and users want interactive
              speeds.  This research will result in new algorithms that are essential to
              supporting emerging applications in large-scale data mining.
