Abstract    :
              9626366  Wittig    The  Materials Science Program at Vanderbilt University will 
              acquire a high resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM)  to   support  
              materials  science  research  and   education  projects.   This instrumentation
              represents the first  joint  commitment between the College of Arts and Science
               and  the  School  of  Engineering to develop the basic  infrastructure  for 
              materials  research.  The existing SEM instrumentation,  acquired  from 1979 to
              1982, has insufficient resolution  to  adequately characterize the diverse
              types of materials  that  comprise   our  expanding  research  efforts.    A  
              primary  capability  for  a  new instrument is variable  accelerating  voltage
              from 0.2 to 30 kV with resolution of at least  2  nm  at  30  kV and 5 nm at l
              kV.  This set of imaging parameters  must  not  compromise the analytical
              capabilities for  x-ray  energy  dispersive  spectroscopy.  In addition,  the 
              system  will  be  fully automated with remote operation capabilities  ald
              integrated into the Vanderbilt computer network.  %%%  A scanning electron
              microscope (SEM) is recognized as one of  the  most widely used materials
              characterization  tools  for  analysis  of all class of materials.  The ability
               to  image  polymers,  ceramics, metals, and semiconductors at nanometer 
              resolution  will impact every area of materials research  at  Vanderbilt.   A 
              high  resolution  SEM  (HRSEM)  will   also  strongly  influence  the 
              educational  development  of   our  graduate  students in Physics, Chemistry, 
              and  Engineering.  ***
