Abstract    :
                      This action funds NSF - Alfred P. Sloan Foundation  Postdoctoral
              Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution.    Gnetales, the presumed sister
              group to angiosperms, have  many angiosperm-like characteristics, including
              flower-like  reproductive units.  This study focuses the evolution of the 
              flower by determining the expression pattern of plant  homeotic genes in the
              Gnetophyte, Welwitschia.  It addresses  the origin of flowers, the evolution of
              gene expression and  the molecular-developmental basis of morphological change.
