Abstract    :
              Osher  9626703       Many physical problems involve interfaces where two 
              different materials contact with each other, or singular sources  or dipoles
              are present along the interfaces immersed in the same  fluid.  Mathematically,
              interface problems usually lead to  differential equations whose input data and
              solutions have  discontinuities or non-smoothness across interfaces.  Many 
              numerical methods designed for smooth solutions do not work  efficiently for
              interface problems.  The investigator's colleague  Zhilin Li combines the
              immersed interface method, a second order  method for solving differential
              equations involving interfaces,  with the level set approach, an efficient
              method  for capturing  moving fronts, to develop high order accurate and
              efficient  numerical methods for interface problems.  The project develops 
              convergence and stability theory to provide theoretical  justification for the
              proposed methods.  Several specific  interface problems, including elliptic and
              parabolic equations  with fixed or moving interfaces, Hele-Shaw flow, and other
               applications, are studied in depth.       Many important practical problems
              lead to differential  equations in regions of 2- or 3-dimensional space that
              are  geometrically complicated, and that contain interfaces across  which the
              nature of the solution changes.  These equations can  rarely be solved exactly,
              and large-scale computation is required  to obtain well-resolved solutions over
              multi-dimensional regions.  The goal of this work is to develop efficient
              computational  methods to approximate solutions of such problems.  The approach
               is to combine two different methods with complementary strengths.  To test the
              new method, it is applied to several problems  representative of those with
              arising in practical applications.
