Abstract    :
              During this proof-of-concept project, an extensive survey of the diversity of
              terrestrial nematodes at two shortgrass steppe sites will be conducted, in
              order to assess whether it is worthwhile to conduct additional surveys of the
              same type in additional sites and habitats.  Even though nematodes are known to
              be very important players in soil ecosystems, free-living soil nematodes from
              the shortgrass steppe are poorly known taxonomically.  A taxonomic baseline
              will be established for these organisms, which will contribute to a better
              understanding of soil nematode communities and the role played by nematodes in
              ecosystem function. The shortgrasse steppe habitat was chosen for this initial
              project because it is likely to be affected by global climate change, and the
              two sites (Central Plains Experimental Range LTER and the Sevilleta LTER) were
              chosen because they have similar plant communities despite differences in
              annual rainfall. The results of this survey will therefore provide results that
              can be compared within the project itself as well as externally to results from
              other nematode surveys from other sorts of habitats.  The databased results of
              the survey will be made available via the Internet from the LTER network server
              or another suitable server, and will for the first time bridge the gap between
              the taxonomy and ecology of soil nematodes in the shortgrass steppe biome.  f8
