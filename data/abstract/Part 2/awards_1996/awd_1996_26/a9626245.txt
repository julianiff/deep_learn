Abstract    :
              9626245  Parker    This proposal contains three projects on the analytic aspects
              of the theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves. The first is an analytic approach
              to computing the enumerative invariants of algebraic geometry; the second
              project aims to identify new constraints on which bubble trees can arise as
              limits of J-holomorphic maps; the third project has to do with Taubes-type
              invariants of symplectic four-manifolds. In particular, the investigator is
              interested in obtaining invariants of symplectic four-manifolds finer than the
              Seiberg-Witten invariants.    Our universe, according to Einstein's general
              theory of relativity, can be thought of as a four-dimensional curved space.
              Four-manifolds then are a mathematical abstraction and generalization of this
              four dimensional curved space. They are general in that different curvature and
              shape properties are possible; they are abstract in that a four manifold does
              not necessarily sit inside an ambient space. Mathematicians have been trying to
              classify four-manifolds according to various schemes in recent years; the
              proposed research looks at so called the differentiable structure of these
              manifolds.
