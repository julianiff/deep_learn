Abstract    :
              9626144  Kispert  University of Alabama Tuscaloosa  This award from the
              Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program (CRIF) and the
              Academic Research and Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist the Department
              of Chemistry at the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa acquire a CCD X-RAY
              Diffractometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including the following: (1) structural investigation of organic donor-acceptor
              solids and high-spin polyradical ions (2)  characterization of unimolecular
              rectifiers and organic conductors (3) study of polyradical ions and other
              extractant interactions with metal ions (4)  investigation of novel superacid
              catalysts, and  (5) study of mutinuclear chromium-carboxylate assemblies.     
              The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise measurements of
              the full three dimensional structure of a molecule. The information obtained
              gives the precise values of all the bond distances and bond angles of a given
              molecule and it gives accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the
              molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
