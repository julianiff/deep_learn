Abstract    :
              9626818  Kania-Bartoszynska    This project belongs in the general area of
              low-dimensional topology. More specifically, it deals with applications of
              topological quantum field theory to classical three-manifold topology. The
              investigator will use quantum invariants to construct obstructions to the
              embedding of three-manifolds in the three-sphere and to construct invariants
              for the detection of lens spaces and Seifert fiber spaces. Additionally,
              quantum invariants are to be used to formulate criteria for the existence of
              symmetries in three-manifolds.    Low-dimensional topology is mainly concerned
              with classifying spaces of dimensions three and four, where two spaces are
              treated as equivalent if one space can be deformed onto the other without
              tearing - this is called a homeomorphic transformation. Such a classification,
              known as the topological classification, has been essentially carried out in
              dimensions other than three and four. It turns out that these two dimensions
              provide various further technical difficulties, some of which are topics of
              much current interest as they interface with deep ideas of modern physics.
