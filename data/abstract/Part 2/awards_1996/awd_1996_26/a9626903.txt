Abstract    :
                     Goldston 9626903  The distribution of primes in various sequences of
              integers is of  critical importance in Number Theory. The study of this
              distribution uses both multiplicative and additive number theory. Some of the
              tools  utilized include the circle method, exponential sums, sieves, and the
              zeta function methods. This project will continue earlier work on obtaining
              lower bounds for pairs of primes in various sequences. The method uses short
              divisor sums and has connections with all of the  aforementioned tools. The
              investigator will further develop and generalize this method. He will also
              examine applications to primes in arithmetic  progressions and multiple
              correlations of primes. A related topic is to obtain asymptotic results when
              averaging is available. In addition, the  investigator will study certain
              problems involving the power sum method; these problems are well suited to an
              undergraduate institution.     This research falls into the general
              mathematical field of Number Theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in
              the study of the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing
              with the divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is among the oldest
              branches of mathematics and  was pursued for many centuries for purely
              aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last half century it has become an
              indispensable tool in diverse  applications in areas such as data transmission
              and processing, and  communication systems.
