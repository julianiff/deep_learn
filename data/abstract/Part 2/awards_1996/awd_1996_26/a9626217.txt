Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-96266217    Principal Investigator:  Lal Pinnaduwage and
              Panos Datskos    "Fundamental Processes of Relevance to Plasma Processing of
              Materials"    ABSTRACT    Comprehensive studies of electron attachment to
              molecules of specific interest to plasma processing will be performed.  The
              presence and importance of the large negative ion densities in processing is
              only recently recognized and its possible roles are being actively
              investigated. Negative ions are very reactive and may contribute to
              etching/deposition processes; in some cases they have been shown to be the
              precursors for particulate formation in processing discharges.  The following
              studies will be undertaken:  (i)    electron attachment studies on
              electronically-excited states of molecules relevant to plasma processing e.g.,
              CH4, CF4, SiH-, Cl2.  (ii)   measurement of electron attachment to radicals
              resulting from the above molecules  (iii)  measurement of the electron
              attachment to the above molecules in their ground electronic states including
              vibrationally-excited states when consistent data are not available  (iv)  
              study of the influence of rare gases on negative ion formation when rare gases
              are mixed with the above gases under discharge conditions.
