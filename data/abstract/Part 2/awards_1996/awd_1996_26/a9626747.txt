Abstract    :
                9626747  Churchill  A collaborative effort between the PI and Colombian
              colleagues, this project will provide a complete floristic treatment of the
              mosses of Colombia.  The Colombian moss flora contains 68 families, 256 genera
              and 889 species, and is estimated to represent 10% of the total worldwide
              diversity of mosses, 30-40% of the Neotropical moss diversity, and 53-60% of
              all mosses in the tropical Andes.  The emphasis of this proposal is concise
              species descriptions, but higher taxa (genera and families) will also be
              described so as to make the work useful to workers in Venezuela south to
              southern Peru as well as those in Colombia.  A database of 15,000 collections
              of Colombian mosses, as well as the text of the Prodromus Bryologiae
              Novo-Granatensis (in both English and Spanish) and a catalogue of Colombian
              moss types will be made available via the Internet in addition to the results
              of the current project. Species descriptions and distribution maps will be
              added to the Internet server in regular updates.  This project will have
              significant impact on knowledge about neotropical mosses, which play an
              important role in maintaining and preserving montane landscapes.
