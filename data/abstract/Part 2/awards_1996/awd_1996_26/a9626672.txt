Abstract    :
              9626672  Alber    In this project methods of symplectic geometry and geometric
              mechanics are to be used to analyze the phase-space geometry of nonlinear wave
              systems and to investigate new techniques for soliton perturbation theory. In
              particular, the investigator plans to study geometric and Maslov phases of
              nonlinear wave systems and a KAM type theory for dynamical systems with phase
              spaces foliated by the nonlinear compact invariant varieties.    Geometric
              mechanics reformulates parts of classical mechanics using the modern language
              of symplectic differential geometry. It has potential applications in a variety
              of applications including locomotion generation, motion control and nonlinear
              optics.
