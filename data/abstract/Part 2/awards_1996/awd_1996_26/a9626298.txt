Abstract    :
              This project will study parallel preconditioners used by iterative methods to
              solve general sparse linear systems of equations.  The new preconditioning
              algorithms will be based on Incomplete Factorization of Complete Matrices
              (IFCM; for example, ILU) and Complete Factorization of Incomplete Matrices
              (CFIM).  The latter approach is rather new.  The PI plans to extend the
              combinatorial algorithms developed in the parallel direct methods to the
              construction of parallel preconditioners.  By exploiting both structural and
              algebraic features of the original matrix, they will design parallel linear
              solvers with a blend of techniques along the continuous spectrum from pure
              iterative to pure direct methods.  The new preconditioners are independent of
              problem domain, and hence are suitable to be used in general-purpose library
              software.  Besides fundamental algorithms research, the PI will produce widely
              usable parallel libraries and tools for computational scientists and engineers.
              The preconditioning software will be based on and augment the best available
              parallel direct-method software and tools, some of which is being developed in
              the PIs thesis work.  The new algorithms and libraries will be bench marked in
              several applications, such as unsymmetric sparse eigenvalue computation,
              groundwater remediation modeling, and Stokesian dynamics models of colloidal
              suspensions.
