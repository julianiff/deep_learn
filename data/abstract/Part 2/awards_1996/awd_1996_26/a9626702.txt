Abstract    :
                  Proposal No. OPP-9626702    Principal Investigator: Kozalos.      ABSTRACT  
                This proposal seeks support for a design study of a submarine-mounted SWAth
              Bathymetric Imaging System (SWABS) to be used on US Navy nuclear-powered
              submarines during future unclassified science cruises to the Arctic Ocean.  The
              system would be an adaptation of a demonstrated design, the SeaMARCTM towed
              side-looking sonar system.  Towed platforms can be readily adapted for hull
              mounting on a submarine.     The proposed 12kHz side-looking sonar will acquire
              co-registered bathymetry and backscatter of the seafloor across a swath up to
              20km wide.  If the SWABS is installed for the 1997 cruise, the remaining three
              cruises in the Submarine Science program (SUBSCI) could collect more than
              800,000 km2 of data, covering a large fraction of the deep Arctic Basin
              operational area for these cruises.     The final result of this study will be
              a set of documents that demonstrate the feasibility of installing a swath
              bathymetric imaging system on the submarine assigned to the 1997 SUBSCI cruise.
