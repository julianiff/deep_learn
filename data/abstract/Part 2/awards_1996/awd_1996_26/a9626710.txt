Abstract    :
              Dr. Marian Stankovich, Department of Chemistry, University of Minnesota,   Twin
              Cities, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic
              Program of the Chemistry Division to enable graduate   students to attend the
              `International Conference on Oxygen Intermediates   in Nonheme
              Metallobiochemistry` at the University of Minnesota on June   23-27, 1996. The
              conference will be the first international gathering to   deal exclusively with
              the topic of oxygen intermediates of nonheme   biological systems and their
              inorganic models.   Nonheme proteins and   enzymes play key roles in such
              diverse functions as environmental   detoxification, synthesis of
              deoxyribonucleotides,  synthesis and   interconversion of amino acids in
              mammalian metabolism, protection of   organisms from damage by activated oxygen
              species, and oxygen transport.  This conference will provide an opportunity for
              graduate students and   faculty, working in an important area of chemistry
              involving the function   of metal ions in biological systems, to share their
              results and   experiences in the field.  A fundamental understanding of these
              systems   is important because these proteins and enzymes play key roles in
              diverse   functions such as environmental detoxification and mammalian
              metabolism,   which impact human health and aging, either directly or
              indirectly,   through their impact on the environment.
