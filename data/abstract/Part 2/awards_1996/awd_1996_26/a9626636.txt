Abstract    :
              This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program,
              focusses on the development of advanced sol-gel  materials to be used in the
              construction of micron dimension  analytical biosensors and biosensor arrays. 
              Biorecognition  molecules will be placed in these sol-gel matrices and their 
              selectivity and reactivity will be characterized.  The biosensor  devices that
              are constructed during this work will be applied to  simultaneous
              multicomponent analyses in complex matrices.  In  this work Professor Bright
              will utilize a broad range of modern  analytical techniques including scanning
              electron microscopy,  mercury porsimetry, optical microscopy, profilometry, and
              static  and time-resolved fluorescence and Raman spectroscopies.  The goal of
              this project is to develop small, reliable, and  inexpensive biosensors that
              can be used in the quantification of  clinically important analytes.  These
              devices will employ  biological molecules as active elements because their
              reactions  are selective and sensitive.  The biological molecules will be  held
              in sol-gel matrices where they will retain their reactivity  within the sensor.
               Professor Bright will also take advantage of  the fact that sol-gel materials
              can be fabricated in very small  dimensions thereby enabling analyses in
              microscopic volumes.  The  work to be done by Professor Bright and his students
              could lead  to new and improved methods for doing important clinical  analyses.
