Abstract    :
              9626375  Grove    The project deals with global problems in Riemannian geometry.
              The investigator intends to study approximations of Riemannian manifolds by
              singular spaces such as Alexandrov spaces and finite metric spaces; to study
              stability and inverse stability problems for Riemannian manifolds; to
              investigate the relationship between curvature and symmetry of Riemannian
              manifolds via the geometry of orbits; to find examples of manifolds with large
              isometry groups and with positive curvature.    Riemannian manifolds are an
              abstraction of curved spaces possessing a distance function. Unlike curves and
              surfaces in 3-space these manifolds do not necessarily sit inside an ambient
              space, hence they are abstract spaces. The proposed research aims to understand
              various global aspects of these manifolds, in particular, the investigator is
              interested in approximations of Riemannian manifolds by finite metric spaces
              and in symmetry properties. Finite metric spaces are closely related to graphs
              so that the project may impact on discrete applications of Riemannian geometry.
