Abstract    :
              The strength and deformation of the ocean crust depends primarily  on the
              strength of the lower crust (oceanic layer 3) which is  composed of gabbros. 
              The strength of these rocks have not been  investigated in detail and this
              project is designed to determine  how the crust deforms when it is under
              pressure and when it is  partially molten.  These results may explain why some
              mid-ocean  ridges have large axial valleys while others do not.  The presence 
              of melt also affects the velocity of seismic waves and the  viscosity of gabbro
              depends on the amount of melt present and how  it is distributed in the rock. 
              This study is designed to make  these measurements so that we can model the
              deformation of the  ocean crust and the velocity of seismic waves.
