Abstract    :
              9626261  Ostrem     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              will develop a novel OCR reader within the framework of an integrated
              technology aimed at providing ordinary people with the means to interact with
              computers in a more natural and productive way.  The technologies required to
              make this possible include on-line hand-writing recognition, Optical Character
              Recognition (OCR), image processing, speech recognition, and the methodology
              for handling interactions between input modalities. This Phase II work will
              take a first important step in this direction - bringing on-line handwriting
              recognition and OCR into a common algorithmic framework. If successful, three
              significant benefits will result: 1) Humans will  interact with computers in a
              more natural way; 2) The state-of-the-art of handwritten OCR readers will 
              improve; and 3) Efficient new commercial products will be developed.  Recently,
              the United States Post Office, a major user of advanced OCR systems, stated
              that "as significant advancements in OCR technology are needed to bring the
              read rate (of handwriting) to the desired level, innovative approaches are
              sought to achieve those advancements."    From a commercial standpoint, a
              product combining OCR and on-line handwriting recognition  in a common
              framework with shared resources will be smaller, more efficient, less costly,
              and easier to maintain than two separate products.  Improved user-interfaces
              and OCR performance are of significant interest to major computer manufacturers
              because they will lead to increased hardware sales and new software products.
