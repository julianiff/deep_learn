Abstract    :
              9626427  Harvey    This project lies in the interface of differential geometry
              and algebraic geometry. The investigator plans to further pursue the theory of
              characteristic currents, calibrations and their various applications.  Of
              particular note is the research on the differentiable version of the
              Riemann-Roch theorem.    Calibrations on a curved space give infinitesimal
              versions of volume-minimizing subspaces. There are certain 'exceptional'
              calibrations that are closely related to continuous symmetry groups. The
              Riemann-Roch theorem is an important theorem in algebraic geometry, but its
              applicability is restricted to the so-called holomorphic category. One of the
              stated goals of this project is to extend the Riemann-Roch theorem to a more
              general setting requiring only the differentiability assumption.
