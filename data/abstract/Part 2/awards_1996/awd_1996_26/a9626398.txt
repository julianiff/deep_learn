Abstract    :
              The principal investigator and his graduate students study  martingales and
              related classes of stochastic processes,  estimates on the size of stochastic
              integrals, the behavior of  Fourier series in spaces of high dimension, and the
              relation of  diffusions and curvature on manifolds.  The focus is on concrete 
              problems whose solutions are applicable in statistical and  mathematical
              analysis of the kind arising in some parts of  economics, the physical and
              natural sciences, and in technology.   At the same time, the principal
              investigator is developing  general methods that may help to solve some of the
              concrete  problems not yet foreseen.
