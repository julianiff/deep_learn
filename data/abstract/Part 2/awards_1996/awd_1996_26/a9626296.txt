Abstract    :
              9626296  Young  With this award, the University of Illinois will acquire a 
              simultaneous thermal analysis-mass spectrometry system for  effluent gas
              analysis.  The system features a state-of-the art  gas-sampling skimmer, that
              operates at high temperatures and  prevents condensation of volatiles prior to
              analysis.  Samples  can be studied up to 2000 C either under vacuum or in a
              variety  of inert or corrosive gases.  The equipment will be used to study  a
              wide variety of materials including:  formation and  regeneration of activated
              carbons, catalysts for NOx reduction,  characterization of aerosols, formation
              of novel cement-polymer  composites (organo cements), hydrous minerals,
              synthesis of  ceramics through pyrolysis of inorganic polymers, and development
               of high temperature phase diagrams.  The instrument will be  located in a
              central facility available to all researchers at the  University of Illinois,
              as well as scientists from other  institutions.  The system will provide a
              unique national resource  for thermal analysis of materials.  ***
