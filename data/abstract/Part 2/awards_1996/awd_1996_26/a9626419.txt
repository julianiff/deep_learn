Abstract    :
              9626419  Wei    The proposed research lies in the area of Riemannian Geometry.
              The investigator wishes to study the effect of Ricci curvature and integral
              curvature bounds on the local geometric structure and topology of the
              underlying Riemannian manifold. For example, the investigator is interested in
              determining the structure of the fundamental group for manifolds with a lower
              Ricci curvature bound.    Riemannian geometry is the study of abstract spaces,
              so called Riemannian manifolds, possessing a distance function. Riemannian
              manifolds are abstract spaces in that they do not necessarily lie in an ambient
              space, unlike curves or surfaces in 3-space. The proposed research has to do
              with the interplay between the topology of a Riemannian manifold - which
              determines its overall shape without regard to 'curvature' - and the metric or
              distance related properties.
