Abstract    :
              Abstract  Ladeinde  9626413    The PIs propose a study of supersonic, turbulent,
              reactive flows using direct numerical simulation (DNS).  The objective of the
              proposed work  is to extend their previous studies on compressible turbulence
              (Ma  0.7), scalar advection, reacting flows and parallel processing to
              chemically reacting compressible turbulence where all the effects are combined.
               The proposed study will involve three dimensional turbulence calculations
              applied to a temporal mixing layer at Mach numbers up to 3.0 and including an
              exothermic, non -premixed, reversible, one-step, four species reaction.  A
              finite difference procedure based on ENO scheme on massively parallel
              architecture will be utilized in this study.  This investigation hopes to yield
              information about the interactions of density fluctuations with species
              transport, chemical production, and turbulence structure.
