Abstract    :
              9626952  Schatz    The Pacific Science Center will develop a 7000 sq. ft.
              traveling  exhibit "Other Worlds! Other Beings"?  Concerned that the general 
              public is largely uninformed about the results of the years of  basic science
              research carried out by U.S. scientists, this exhibit  will provide an
              opportunity for visitors to learn about the results  of this research and
              increase their own understanding of the earth  and the solar system in general.
               The exhibit will introduce  visitors to the planets, their environmental
              characteristics,  potential and unlikely probability for life to exist on other
               planets and the processes involved in astronomical research.  In  addition to
              the exhibit, they will develop a planetarium program,  materials for use by
              teachers and students, various workshops and  other programs for teachers and
              community leaders, and a full  marketing package for participating museums. 
              The exhibit will  travel to a minimum of nine museums during its three year
              tour  after opening at the Pacific Science Center in December, 1997.
