Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              program supports research and education by Dr. Cynthia K. Schauer of the  
              Chemistry Department, University of North Carolina, on the synthesis of  
              molecular clusters containing transition metals.  The synthetic strategy   is
              to prepare molecular `modules` that can be linked to form more complex  
              structures.  Emphasis will be placed on understanding how changes in the  
              `modules` affect the electronic interactions between the components once   they
              are assembled.  Three types of clusters will be synthesized:   redox-active
              metal-bridged variable-length chains based on iron-phosphide   modules; metal
              inidene chains in which the chains are singly or doubly   bridged and differ in
              conjugation as a result of varying the presence of   P, As, or Sb; dendrimeric
              structures containing transition metals with   designed redox centers.   This
              research expands the boundaries of rational synthesis of extended   inorganic
              molecular materials.  Theoretical and experimental approaches   will be used to
              probe the electronic properties of these materials and   acquire fundamental
              information concerning their potential in electronic   applications.
