Abstract    :
              Tang 9626655   A novel concept, the pseudo-random recurrent artificial neural
              networks (ANN) will be used in control applications.  The Pseudo-random
              recurrent ANN is a novel concept derived from previous work on pseudo-random
              interconnection networks.  Instead of using a fully connected feedforward or
              recurrent network, a pseudo-random ANN is connected with a pseudo-random graph
              that can provide almost random connections of lots of neurons with a  small
              number of links at each neuron.  The idea is to use the large number of neurons
              to capture the non-linear nature of the control system; and yet the small
              number of links makes real-time implementation feasible.   The underlying
              pseudo-random graph, known as Cayley graphs have been the densest known graphs
              which means they have the largest number of nodes for a given degree and
              diameter.  By exploiting the node-symmetric property of these graphs,  simple
              simultaneous broadcasting their signals to all other neurons  can be developed.
               The result is a "brain-like" ANN that have a large number  of neurons
              (hundreds and thousands) connected in an almost random manner with a relatively
              small number of connections.  These pseudo-random ANNs will be implemented with
              reinforcement control strategies such as the backpropagation of utility and the
              heuristic dynamic programming for some existing  non-linear control
              applications.  The investigation of ANNs that do not require complete
              connections of neurons will pave the way for a new form of ANN that has more
              resemblance to its biological counterpart.
