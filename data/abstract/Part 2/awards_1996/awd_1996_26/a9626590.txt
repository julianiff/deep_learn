Abstract    :
              9626590  Lalley    The main focus of the investigation will be on how the coarse
               geometry of a state space constrains the behavior of stochastic  processes
              supported by the state space, in particular, on  categorizing the behaviors
              possible for random walks and random  growth processes (such as branching
              random walks and contact  processes) in hyperbolic geometries.  Particular
              attention will  be paid to behaviors that cannot occur in Euclidean state
              spaces,  such as exponential population growth with eventual extinction in 
              every compact subset.  Related problems regarding the mixing rate  for various
              finite state Markov chains will also be investigated,  with the immediate aim
              of contributing to the understanding of  the so-called "cutoff phenomenon".   
              Random growth processes serve as crude models of population  growth in
              structured environments, and thus are of natural  interest in population
              biology.  They are also important as  models in various areas of theoretical
              physics, in particular,  statistical mechanics.  Problems concerning  mixing
              rates of   finite-state Markov chains are of practical importance because of 
              the increasing use of "Markov chain Monte Carlo" methods in  simulation
              studies.  ***
