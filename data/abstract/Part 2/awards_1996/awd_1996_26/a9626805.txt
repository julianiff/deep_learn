Abstract    :
              9626805  Peck       The mechanism by which stars produce energy is, with the 
              exception of cataclysmic terminal events, the burning of nuclear  fuel.  The
              details of how this occurs has been a field of intense  study for the past
              sixty years, necessitating knowledge of many  subfields such as nuclear physics
              and stellar evolution.  ***
