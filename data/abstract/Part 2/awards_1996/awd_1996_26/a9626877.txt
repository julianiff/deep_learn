Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the following problems:    (1) Determine explicit
              bounds involving primitive roots  and Artin's conjecture that are useful in the
              analysis of several  number-theoretic algorithms under the assumption of the
              extended  Riemann hypothesis.         (2) Study two problems involving GCD
              algorithms.  The first is to  design and implement genetic algorithms for the
              extended GCD  problem.  The second is to analyze the left- and right- shift k- 
              ary GCD algorithms, including determining average-case behavior  and studying
              the so-called "spurious factors" introduce during  the main loops of the
              algorithms.         (3) Design, analyze, and implement algorithms for computing
              the  Jacobi symbol based on Lehmer's Euclidean GCD algorithm.    Undergraduate
              students will be involved in this research, in  particular in the design and
              implementation of algorithms in the  last two problems above.  ***
