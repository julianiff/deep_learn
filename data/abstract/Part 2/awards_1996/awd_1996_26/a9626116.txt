Abstract    :
              9626116 Kurtz  ABSTRACT   Research programs will be carried out in the areas of
              Markov processes, spatial point processes, stochastic analysis, and stochastic
              control.  Work on Markov processes will focus on measure-valued processes
              related to population genetics and other population models and new types of
              stochastic equations for Markov processes.  New models for spatial point
              processes will be developed and corresponding statistical issues addressed. 
              Previous work on stochastic equations driven by semimartingale random measures
              will be extended with particular emphasis on infinite systems of equations and
              models arising in the study of stochastic networks.  Theoretical developments
              for general stochastic control problems will include approximation methodology
              and existence theorems for optimal singular controls.       The study of
              stochastic processes is concerned with mathematical descriptions of natural
              phenomena governed by "random" or "chance" mechanisms.  Mathematical models of
              such phenomena may attempt to describe variation in time, in space, or both. 
              The research to be performed is concerned with developing methods for
              specifying these mathematical models, approximating complex models by simpler
              ones, and determining how to influence or "control" the evolution of the models
              and the phenomena they represent.  Several particular types of models will be
              studied.
