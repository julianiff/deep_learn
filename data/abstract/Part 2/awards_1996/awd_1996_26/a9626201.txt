Abstract    :
              Durrett will continue to apply the theory of stochastic spatial  models to
              problems in biology, specifically studying: (a)  abundance distributions
              generated by the voter model with  mutation that are an alternative to the
              traditional lognormal,  (b) hybrid zones and their scaling limits -- motion by
              mean  curvature, (c) a generalization of the biased voter model used by 
              Silvertown to model the competition of grass species, and (d) a  nonlinear
              predator prey model that displays oscillatory behavior.   In an interacting
              particle system, space is represented as a grid  of sites each one of which can
              be in one of a finite set of  states and changes its state at a rate that
              depends on the states  of finitely many neighbors. These models have a
              structure that is  well suited to many problems in biology and have recently
              seen  many applications there. Durrett's investigations will continue  previous
              work seeking to understand when the spatial distribution  of individuals has an
              important effect on the outcome of  competition and when it can be ignored.
              Earlier work has already  identified a number of situations in which
              non-spatial approaches  give incorrect answers to questions about the
              persistence or  coexistence of competing species.
