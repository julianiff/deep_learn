Abstract    :
              9626801  Latiolais       This award provides partial support for the fall 1996
              Workshop  on the Symbiosis of Topology and Group Theory.  The award is to 
              Portland State University, but faculty and graduate students  from the
              University of Oregon and Oregon State University are heavily   involved as
              well.  Additional participants, including graduate students,   postdocs, and
              faculty investigators, represent other states and foreign   countries. 
              Previous workshops of the same nature include a 1993 conference  in Oregon and
              earlier workshops in Luttach, Italy.  The site of this year's  workshop is
              Mazama, Washington, in the Northern Cascade Mountains.       The workshop has
              been planned for nine days beginning September 30,  and this duration allows
              the detailed program to evolve somewhat in response  to preferences expressed
              by particpants upon their arrival.  Those invited  have expertise in quantum
              groups, low dimensional topology, combinatorial  homotopy, algebraic K-theory,
              and combinatorial group theory.  The goal is  to obtain progress in areas
              relating to the application of quantum groups  as topological obstruction
              groups, new classification schemes for manifolds  and 2-complexes, new
              computational methods for the second homotopy group,  further inroads on the
              Kervaire-Laudenbach conjecture, application of the  tools of automatic groups
              to low dimensional homotopy theory, and issues  relating to Whitehead's
              asphericity conjecture.  Past experience suggests  that unexpected connections
              will be made and that these will be at least  as significant as any that could
              be foreseen.  ***
