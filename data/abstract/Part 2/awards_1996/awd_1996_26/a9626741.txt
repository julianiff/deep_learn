Abstract    :
              9626741  Lu   The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in the
              Mathematical   Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for
              exchange of mathematical   scientists between academia and industry at
              different stages of their careers. These   programs will strengthen the links
              between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of
              research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Industry   Postdoctoral
              Research Fellowships provide two years of support for recent recipients of  
              doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. These awards are a means of
              contributing   to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation.
              The postdoctoral fellow will   work closely with scientific advisors from both
              academia and industry.   The postdoctoral fellow will work under the direction
              of Paul A. Brinkley at   Northern Telecom and Jye-Chyi Lu at North Carolina
              State University. The research   involves the development of a supervisory
              process control system to improve production   quality of digital wireless
              communications equipment. The research involves statistical   modeling using a
              spatial random coefficients model.
