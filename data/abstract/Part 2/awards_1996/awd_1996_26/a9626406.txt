Abstract    :
              The identification of systems with high noise levels is very challenging, since
              models of such systems are typically plagued by high model variance. This lead
              to higher expected prediction errors.  This project will investigate two
              promising new approaches for reducing model variance and thus the variance of
              prediction errors: (1) New classes of smoothing regularizes for both
              feedforward and recurrent networks for reducing model variance while imposing
              desirable model biases.  The PI expect, that his new smoothing regularizes will
              outperform standard quadratic weight decay, and ad hoc methods,  in many cases
              of interest.  (2) New committee bootstrap methods for reducing the prediction
              errors due to model variance.  These include independent bootstrapping of
              training and validation sets within the committee, mutual training and model
              selection methods, and robust adaptive committees.  The PI expects that his new
              committee bootstrap methods will achieve better training, better model
              selection, and greater variance reduction than is attainable be individual
              networks or by conventional committee averaging methods.  The research will
              involve new analytical work, algorithm development, and extensive empirical
              testing of the algorithms on noisy time series prediction problems n
