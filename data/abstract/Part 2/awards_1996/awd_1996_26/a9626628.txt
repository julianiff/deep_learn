Abstract    :
              DMS 9626628  C. Ward Henson      C. Ward Henson seeks to use methods from logic
              to solve problems within other areas of mathematics and computer science, and
              to use logic as a basis for formulating new concepts and posing new problems
              within them.  This project has the following main aspects:  (a) the further
              development of Henson's logic for models based on Banach spaces (or, more
              generally, on metric spaces), and the continued application of this theory to
              problems of functional analysis; (b) the study of exponentiation and other
              elementary functions from the model-theoretic point of view; objectives of this
              study include determining the computational complexity of the first order
              theory of the real exponential field and axiomatizing the identities satisfied
              by such other elementary functions as the Gamma function; (c) continued
              investigation of the computational complexity of logical decision problems,
              especially those arising from the most central areas of mathematics.    This
              project emphasizes the relations between symbolic logic and other areas of
              mathematics and computer science.  During the past 40 years techniques from
              logic have not only clarified the foundations of mathematics, but have
              contributed new tools for solving mathematical problems.  These tools have been
              particularly effective in those areas of mathematics close to algebra.  This
              project concentrates on making those same logic tools equally effective in the
              areas of mathematics closer to topology and geometry.
