Abstract    :
              Abstract  Hu  9626743    The award will partially support a conference on
              Dynamical Systems and Differential Equations that will be held at Southwest
              Missouri State University May29-June1.  The subject of the conference is area
              that has seen rapid expansion in the last decade, partly due to the advancement
              of computational technology.    Differential equations provide the fundamental
              paradigm for mathematical models of motion.  In this regard, differential
              equation models of fluid dynamics are important for understanding weather
              prediction, airplane flight, and the flow of blood through the human heart.
