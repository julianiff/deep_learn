Abstract    :
              The project is directed toward the advancement of empirical  techniques to model
              the magnetospheric dymamics as characterized by  various ground-based indices
              derived from magnetic data.  Effort  will be focused in the development of
              nonlinear dynamical models  which address the spatial structure of
              agnetospheric disturbances  obtained from the analysis of observational time
              series data.   Coupling between different regions of the magnetosphere will be 
              studied to build models to predict the local behavior.  The project  will be
              novel in the use of multi-point groundbased satellite data  for the development
              of a multivariate model of the dynamic behavior  of different regions of the
              magnetosphere and for the analysis of  this model to identify dominant physical
              processes which may  complement the development of first principle models.
