Abstract    :
              9626999  Hanson    "Under the Rock: An Experiment in Neighborhood
              Exhibit-Making" is  a project that will engage children in the development of
              exhibits  as well as present information about backyard ecology.  The 
              Children's Museum staff will work with Federated Dorchester  Neighborhood
              Houses (a group of inner city neighborhood centers in  Boston) to develop a
              model activity that uses the theory and  practice of exhibit making as a tool
              to engage children in science  learning in their neighborhoods.  They will work
              with children and  their parents in the exploration of insect life in their
              urban  settings and presentation of their findings in exhibits the  children
              will make.  Exhibit making includes the entire process of:  studying live
              insects, doing research, writing text, designing and  building interactive
              activities for an exhibit about insects, and  marketing the exhibit.  Exhibit
              making has been chosen as the  pedagogical technique because it parallels
              creative work done in  the real world; it involves people working together in
              teams, and  utilizes different skills and intelligences of the participants.  
              In addition to the exhibits, other results of this project will  include: an
              educator's guidebook documenting the process of  exhibit-making in community
              centers; a proposal for an activity  book for kids with writing samples and
              illustrations that will be  submitted to a publisher; video and electronic
              resources; and  contributions and recommendations for the Museum's "Under the
              Rock"  exhibit, a new exhibit to be developed subsequent to the completion  of
              the first two phases of this project.
