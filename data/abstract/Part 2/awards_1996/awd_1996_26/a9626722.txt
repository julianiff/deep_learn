Abstract    :
              9626722  Guan    This project pursues geometric partial differential equations.
              Analysis of many problems in differential geometry often leads to questions
              concerning nonlinear partial differential equations. The investigator plans to
              study Monge-Ampere type equations with an emphasis on the regularity of
              solutions in the degenerate case; the Christoffel-Minkowski problems and
              related Hessian equations; the Dirichlet problem for hypersurfaces of
              prescribed curvatures; curvature evolution equations for hypersurfaces.   
              Unlike linear partial differential equations there is little general theory
              regarding nonlinear partial differential equations. Yet many problems arising
              in various geometric settings can only be formulated as nonlinear differential
              equations. And the proposed research represents an attempt to pursue these
              equations from a geometric perspective - the main advantage of the geometric
              approach seems to be that one is able to make fairy strong, but geometrically
              meaningful, assumptions thereby simplifying the equations.
