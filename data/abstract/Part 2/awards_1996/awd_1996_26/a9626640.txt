Abstract    :
              9626640  Landsberg    The proposed research lies in the interface of
              differential geometry and algebraic geometry. Given a projective variety, its
              dual variety is defined to be the union of all hyperplanes tangent to it. In
              this project, the dimension and degeneracy of dual varieties will be
              investigated. Homogeneous varieties will also be studied using higher order
              contact invariants, thus from a local perspective.    Algebraic geometry deals
              with solutions to polynomial equations, often emphasizing the global geometric
              aspect of the solution set; it is one of the most developed branches of modern
              mathematics with applications to control theory, robotics and other engineering
              disciplines. Differential geometry emphasizes local or infinitesimal properties
              of (hyper-) surfaces. One of the goals of this project is to recover various
              global and algebraic properties encoded in the local differential geometry of
              projective varieties.
