Abstract    :
              9626286  Williams    The objective of this project is to develop a new
              instrument  based upon the integration of Scanning Tunneling Microscope  (STM)
              and a modified Electrostatic Force Microscope (EFM).  The new instrument called
              the Scanning Tunneling Charge  Transfer Microscope (STCTM) will operate in an
              ultra-high  vacuum chamber, and will provide a means to transfer single 
              electrons to and from atomic scale surface structure with  atomic spatial 
              resolution.  It will provide the ability to  measure the electronic response of
              the surface to the  transferred charge.  Ultrasmall currents should also be 
              measurable by the proposed scanning probe tips.  The  proposed work will
              significantly extend the capabilities of  existing atomic scale
              characterization methods.  The  combination of ultrasmall charge/current
              detection and  atomic spatial resolution provides a powerful tool for 
              examining conducting and insulating nanostructure.  These  measurement
              capabilities should have a profound impact on  materials research, especially
              in the area of nanostructured  materials and devices.  ***
