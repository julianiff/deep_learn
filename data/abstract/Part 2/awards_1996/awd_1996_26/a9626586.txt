Abstract    :
              Observations of performance of structures during past earthquakes demonstrate
              that buildings with asymmetric floor plan tend to suffer greater damage because
              it is impractical to avoid such buildings with irregular distribution of
              stiffness and strength in plan and such buildings are especially vulnerable to
              earthquake damage, there is urgent need to develop an improved understanding of
              the earthquake response of these buildings.  The objectives of this research
              project are to:  (1) develop an improved understanding of the inelastic
              response of buildings undergoing torsional motions during earthquakes; (11)
              develop simplified analysis procedures suitable for preliminary design of such
              new buildings and for the design of retrofit schemes for existing buildings;
              and (III) propose--for consideration by code-writing entities like the SEAOC
              Seismology Committee--improved code provisions for accidental and natural
              torsion.  The central feature of the research is to  utilize recorded motions
              of well instrumented buildings during recent earthquakes to evaluate and
              calibrate analysis and design procedures in order to ensure that these
              procedures provide reliable estimates of torsional effects.  The comprehensive
              but simple analysis and design developed should be of direct benefit to the
              profession.  They would be useful for checking the preliminary design of new
              buildings, for evaluating alternatives to retrofit existing buildings with 
              unacceptably large asymmetry in their plans, and for improving building codes.
