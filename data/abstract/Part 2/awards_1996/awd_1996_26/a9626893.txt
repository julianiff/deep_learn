Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9626893    This is a study of molecular structure-activity
              relationships in the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide over
              supported solid metal-oxide catalysts.  (The sulfuric acid contact process,
              which uses a supported molten salt as the catalyst, is not the subject of this
              study.)  Fundamental issues addressed include the kinetics, the  reaction
              mechanism, the nature of the active site including size and structure, and the
              effects of the support, surface additives and various gases such as water,
              nitric oxide, hydrocarbons, and ammonia.  Model supported catalysts containing
              reducible oxides of vanadium, molybdenum, chromium, rhenium, or manganese are
              synthesized, characterized by Raman, infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance
              spectroscopies, and tested for catalytic activity for the subject reaction. 
              This information is used to establish structure-activity relationships for
              oxidation of sulfur dioxide.    The solid-oxide catalyzed oxidation of sulfur
              dioxide is important in the industrial  production of sulfuric acid as well as
              in several environmental technologies including the DESONOX and SNOX processes
              for removing nitrogen and sulfur from industrial (including electric power
              generator) plants and selective catalytic reduction to remove nitrogen oxides,
              for in which sulfur trioxide is a poison.
