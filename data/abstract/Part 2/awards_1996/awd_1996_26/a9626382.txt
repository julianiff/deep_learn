Abstract    :
              9626382  Mazzeo    This proposal is in the general area of geometric and
              microlocal analysis. The investigator intends to continue the development of
              degenerate pseudodifferential techniques and to apply them to scattering theory
              and spectral analysis of elliptic partial differential equations. These
              techniques involve explicit geometric constructions of parametrics and
              generalized inverses for degenerate elliptic operators.    Many problems in
              physics and geometry can be described by systems of partial differential
              equations. Elliptic partial differential equations - describing, for example,
              various heat flow phenomena - form a particularly well-developed branch within
              the theory of partial differential equations. The proposed research deals with
              the 'singular' aspect of elliptic differential equations which are
              theoretically more difficult than the smooth case.
