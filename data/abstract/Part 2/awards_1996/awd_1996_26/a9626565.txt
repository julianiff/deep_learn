Abstract    :
              9626565  Wolf    The proposed research lies in the area of variational calculus
              and minimal surfaces. Specifically, two topics are proposed: Teichmuller
              theoretic methods for finding minimal surfaces in Euclidean 3-space, and the
              geometry of a hyperbolic three-manifold via families of harmonic maps of
              surfaces thereto.    Minimal surfaces first arose in a series of soap film
              experiments done by the Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau in the 19th century.
              These surfaces have an area-minimizing property: given a closed contour in
              space, the minimal surface spanning it has the smallest surface area amongst
              all surfaces bounding the same contour. Because of this and other extremal
              properties minimal surfaces find many applications in physics, chemistry and
              materials research. The proposed research has to do with constructing families
              of such minimal surfaces using complex analysis methods and a study of
              negatively curved 3-spaces using minimal surface techniques.
