Abstract    :
                      The Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean remains one of the least known
              regions of the earth, yet understanding it's evolution is important to
              understanding the history of ocean circulation, climate generation, as well as
              the fact that the Alaska margin of the Canada Basin contains one of the world's
              giant hydrocarbon fields. In order to complete the aerogeophysical coverage of
              the Canada Basin between the Alpha and Mendeleyev ridges and the Arctic
              Alaska/Canada and Far Eastern Siberia margins, two seasons of aerogeophysics
              are proposed.  The three most important aspects of the proposed work are: 1)
              Collect reconnaissance aerogeophysical data that will allow specific hypotheses
              to be formulated about the tectonic evolution of the Canada Basin of the
              Arctic. 2) Combine the aerogeophysical data collected offshore with a
              high-resolution aeromagnetics survey of Arctic Alaska's continental shelf. 
              Work with these two datasets should definitely answer the question of the
              nature of the Ocean-Continent Boundary along Arctic Alaska.  3)  Survey in
              detail gravity over the Chukchi Plateau and onto the continental margin of what
              should be the buried North  Chukchi Basin to allow insight into the evolution
              of this margin.  Present data does not allow reasonable interpretation of the
              evolution of this margin.
