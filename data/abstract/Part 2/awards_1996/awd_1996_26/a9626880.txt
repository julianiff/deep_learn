Abstract    :
              9626880  Smirnov    This project deals with harmonic analysis on symmetric
              spaces and Radon transforms. In particular, the investigator plans to study
              those symplectic structures appearing as Radon transforms on the space of
              hyperplanes. Geometric probability theory and Crofton's integral formula are
              also to be considered as they relate to Radon transforms.    The idea behind
              Radon transforms is to reconstruct a geometric object - e.g., a convex body in
              space - from its sectional data or slices. This field has received a great deal
              of attention recently due to its applications in computerized tomography and
              medical scanning devices.
