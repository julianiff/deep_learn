Abstract    :
                  9626824  Gotthelf    This grant provides support for Season IV of The Magic
              School Bus, the fully animated PBS series targeted at youth ages 6-9. 
              Components of Season IV will include 13 new episodes, educational support for
              teachers and youth leaders, dissemination and presentations at major
              educational conferences, promotion, and summative evaluation.   The new
              programs will bring the total number of programs to 54 making it possible to
              broadcast the series as a daily strip without undue repeat broadcast which
              might cause the series to loose its freshness.    All of the current principal
              staff of the project will remain for the fourth season.  Cheryl Gotthelf will
              be PI and Executive Project Director.  Jane Startz will be Co-PI and Executive
              Producer for the series and Michael Templeton will be a Co-PI and Science
              Content Director.  Kristin Martin will continue as Supervision Producer.
