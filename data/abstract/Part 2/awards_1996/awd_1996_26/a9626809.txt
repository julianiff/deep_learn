Abstract    :
              9626809  Dugger    The document, Rationale and Structure for the Study of
              Technology, produced by the International Technology Education Association,
              identifies six components that are the basis of technological literacy for all
              students.  They are designing and developing, determining and controlling
              behavior, utilizing, assessing, contextual relationships, nature and evolution
              of technology, and technological concepts and principles.  Using this as a
              basis, this project develops standards for what technological concepts and
              processes students should understand and be able to apply in grades K-12 with
              benchmarks at grades 2, 5, 8 and 12.  The standards are compiled by a small
              central staff.  Three  teams, consisting of representatives from technology
              education, both teachers and technologists, as well as representatives from
              science, mathematics, and engineering some of whom were involved in developing
              other standards, provide the content.  Input and consensus is developed by
              presentations to diverse groups interested in education, newsletters, and the
              WWW.   Third party evaluation is used to monitor the content and the process to
              assure that the standards are useful in a variety of contexts.
