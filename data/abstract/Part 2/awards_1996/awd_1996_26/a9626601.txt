Abstract    :
              DMS 96-26601  Eaton          This research involves the evaluation of
              statistical inferences       which are expressed as data dependent probability
              distributions.       Inferences of particular interest include both posterior  
                   distributions and predictive distributions which are derived        from
              improper prior distributions coupled with the formal application       of Bayes
              Theorem. Questions concerning the admissibility of        inferences have lead
              to the development of new and powerful       techniques based on a fundamental
              connection between issues in        statistical decision theory and
              recurrence/transcience issues       involving symmetric Markov Chains. This
              fundamental connection is       further developed in this research along with
              the somewhat allied        noton of strong inconsistency for inferences.
              Applications of this       research include the evaluation and improvement of
              inferential       techniques in high dimensional models such as those which
              arise       in large scale environmental models and those attempting to
              describe       global change.  %%%       Many problems of statistics, such as
              those which arise in environmental       studies, involve the simultaneous
              description and/or simultaneous       prediction of many variables. In such
              cases, one often speaks of        "high dimensional problems". This research
              involves the construction,       evaluation and comparison of statistical
              methods which are relevant       in these high dimensional problems. Recent
              developments have shown       that the problems which arise in this research
              are, rather surprisingly,       closely connected with certain problems which
              arise in a seemingly       unrelated area of probability. This connection
              promises to yield       exciting new insights regarding both practical and
              theoretical issues       involving high dimensional problems.  ***
