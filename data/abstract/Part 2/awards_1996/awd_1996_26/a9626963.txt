Abstract    :
              This research pursues some questions which are related to and  inspired in part
              by discussions the P.I., Dr. Diane Meuser, has had  and and continue to have
              with Professor Kazhdan and Professor Mazur  of Harvard University.    Professor
              Meuser is studying properties of a generalized p-adic  local Igusa zeta
              function.  A special case is the "p-adic volume"  of a variety which is the
              integral of the analytic differential w  on a compact analytic variety X and it
              is this case that she has  been discussing with Kazhdan and Mazur.  A special
              case she is  working on in detail is the generalized zeta function in the case 
              where X is an elliptic curve and w is the unique invariant  differential on the
              elliptic curve.    Interactive activities include: involvement with graduate
              and  undergraduate women through a Women in Mathematics organization,  and
              serving as a faculty advisor to a residence hall at Harvard  University.
