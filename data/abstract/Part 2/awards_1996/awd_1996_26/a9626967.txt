Abstract    :
              9626967  Weiner  This project aims at experimental tests of novel ultrashort
              pulse code-division, multiple-access (CDMA) fiber communications systems. 
              These systems are enabled by a femtosecond optical encoding and decoding
              technology, which uses a passive parallel modulation scheme to achieve
              Terabit/sec effective serial modulation rates.  Multiple users are accommodated
              in such a system by assigning different, minimally interfering optical code
              sequences to different subscriber pairs.  A unique attribute of optical CDMA is
              the use of  optical processing, which can circumvent electronics bottlenecks
              and which potentially can implement directly in the optical domain certain
              network operations, such as addressing and security, which traditionally have
              been performed electronically.  The impact of the CDMA approach is likely to
              focus on high performance applications such as supercomputer interconnects,
              over relatively short distances.  ***
