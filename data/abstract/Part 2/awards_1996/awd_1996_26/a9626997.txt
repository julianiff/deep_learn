Abstract    :
              9626997  Olson    The Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History (LACMNH) will
               develop "Cats! Wild to Mild" a traveling exhibit on endangered wild  and
              domestic cats.  This will be a 5000 sq. ft. exhibit intended to  engage
              families, school groups, and adults in the history, biology,  and evolution of
              the family Felidae.  The primary objectives of the  exhibit are to awaken
              interest in scientific study in children, to  provide parents and children with
              a stimulating interactive  environment, to increase public knowledge about the
              status and  conservation of wild cats, and to promote responsible pet care.  
              The exhibit will include a large number of mounted cat specimens  and various
              interactive activities in addition to label panels.  A  broad menu of
              complementary programming is planned, both for use at  LACMNH and by museums
              hosting the exhibit.  Items and activities  include: teacher enhancement
              activities, curriculum guide, and  other materials, pre-and post-visit
              materials for students, family  take-home materials, kits for teachers and
              families, a CD-ROM and  a place on the museum's WWW page with an extensive
              amount of  information about cats and activities for the user, among other 
              things.  The formal education materials will be designed to  integrate the
              study of cats into state-mandated areas of the  curriculum such as reading,
              mathematics, and social studies.  An  audience that is specially targeted is
              the traditionally  underserved group.  The exhibit will have a five year tour
              at  fifteen venues and will open at LACMNH early spring, 1997.
