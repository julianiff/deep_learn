Abstract    :
                   The objectives of this project are to determine what spider species live in
              the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which has a very rich but relatively
              unknown invertebrate fauna.  In fact, the PI anticipates that as many as 60
              species of spiders previously unknown to science will be discovered during the
              course of the study. Eighteen target habitats will be thoroughly sampled within
              the 207,000-hectare Park.  The results of the inventory will be distributed in
              the form of an online database and spider identification guide that will be
              useful in managing Park resources, providing an educational experience for Park
              visitors and others, and in future ecological and systematic research on
              spiders.  The PI will involve students in all aspects of the study, providing
              them with a rich experience in natural habitats and in sampling and analytical
              protocols.  |        H H     + (с?сG Р F G ( n     H H     + (     d
