Abstract    :
              9626597 Dobrow  ABSTRACT   Trees are fundamental data structures in computer
              science and have been the focus of much recent work in probability. The
              investigator applies modern approximation and Markov chain techniques to the
              study of random tree models. The work focuses on exploring the applicability of
              Chen-Stein techniques for Poisson approximation to obtain distributional
              results for functionals of random trees. The project also addresses the
              analysis of self-organizing random trees and the efficacy of using Markov chain
              Monte Carlo techniques to generate near-random search trees.  The project has
              significance for the design and analysis of algorithms, particularly in
              computer science. Tree models also arise in statistics, physics, chemistry,
              sociology, and numerous other scientific areas. A first line of investigation
              into the behavior of such trees is to consider how a ``typical'' tree behaves.
              Thus a random model is postulated and characteristics of the ``random tree''
              are studied. The methods that the investigator considers have previously been
              applied with success in several other areas of  probability and statistics.
