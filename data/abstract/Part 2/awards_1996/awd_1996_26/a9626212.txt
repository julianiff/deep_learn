              Mime-Version: 1.0      Dear Carol,    below are the two abstracts (finally). I
              shall be waiting for any  comments, suggestions, etc. On my portion, I was
              somewhat general, instead of  specifically indicating that in particular, I am
              interested in the  determinacy strength of mice with so many measurables above
              some fixed  number of Woodin cardinals. I guess this is fine, being general,
              and  better satisfies the purpose of the abstract??        Thanks in advance
              for any comments,           Derrick

              Burke and Derrick DuBose are involved in this project.  The  research of
              Douglas Burke is primarily concerned with generic embeddings  in set theory. 
              These embeddings have been instrumental in using new  axioms (large cardinals)
              to prove statements that are undecidable in the  usual, basic axioms of set
              theory.  In particular, they have many  applications in descriptive set theory
              and combinatorial set theory. Burke  has two long term goals in his research
              program: (i) to apply large  cardinals and generic embeddings to combinatorial
              questions (and apply  combinatorial results to questions about generic
              embeddings), and (ii) to  extend the connection between large cardinals and
              definable well-orderings  of the real numbers to larger classes of definable
              sets. Derrick DuBose  has been engaged in establishing correspondences between
              inner models  closed under sharp functions and the determinacy of classe s near
              the  bottom of the analytic hierarchy.  He intends to establish similar 
              correspondences involving classes higher up in the analytic hierarchy.  He 
              will also continue to investigate moderate determinacy assumptions and the 
              determinacy strength of small "mice" and of mild large cardinal properties.   
              During the last fifty years, many natural mathematical questions have been 
              shown to be independent of the usual axioms of set theory.  In order to  decide
              such questions, new axioms have been introduced.  Of particular  importance are
              Large Cardinal Axioms and Determinacy Hypotheses. The Large  Cardinal Axioms
              are axioms of infinity, whereas determinacy hypotheses  state that certain
              definable infinite games have winning strategies.  Surprisingly, a strong
              connection exists between these two groups of  axioms. Also both are important
              in that they decide many properties about  sets of real numbers and other
              ``small'' sets.
