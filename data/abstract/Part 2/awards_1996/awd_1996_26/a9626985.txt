Abstract    :
              Dr. Mary T. Didiuk has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research   Fellowship in
              Chemistry.  Dr. Didiuk received the doctoral degree from   Boston College under
              the supervision of Professor Amir H. Hoveyda.  Dr.   Didiuk will continue
              research at Harvard University under the sponsorship   of Professor Gregory L.
              Verdine.  The postdoctoral research targets   studies that afford structural
              information on DNA damage recognition and   catalysis.  Inhibitors bind to DNA
              glycosylases tightly, but do not   undergo the catalytic cascade of events. 
              This allows for the formation   of a stable DNA-protein complex which the
              research examines in detail.    The studies are intended to elucidate
              structural details on the substrate   binding mode of DNA glycosylases in order
              to obtain an understanding of   the function of these DNA repair enzymes.  The
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as   an
              important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge   and
              experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in  
              contemporary chemical research and teaching.
