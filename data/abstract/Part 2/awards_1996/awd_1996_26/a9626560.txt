Abstract    :
              9626560  Pitts    The project lies in the area of minimal surface theory. The
              investigator plans to utilize the geometric calculus of variations to consider
              desingularization and construction of minimal surfaces. In addition, the
              investigator proposes to show that any compact Riemannian manifold contains
              infinitely many distinct minimal hypersurfaces, again using the variational
              approach.    Minimal surfaces first arose in a soap film experiment done by the
              Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau around 1850, where Plateau observed that a
              soap film surface bounded by a closed wire contour has the least surface area
              amongst all surfaces spanned by the same wire contour. Minimal surfaces turn
              out to have other remarkable mathematical properties (the average curvature at
              any point must equal zero); their study involves several branches of modern
              mathematics. Additionally, minimal surfaces can be used to model condensed
              matter, e.g., compound polymer systems.
