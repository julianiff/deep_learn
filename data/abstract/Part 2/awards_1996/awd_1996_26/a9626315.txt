Abstract    :
                      9626315  Pena-Mora   This project seeks to explore how negotiation
              models can best be  shaped to fit needs of the large-scale engineering
              environment, and  hoe the negotiation table within that environment might
              benefit  from the model. Because the negotiation "table" under consideration 
              is a computerized communication network, this research will include 
              recommendations on how to capture the theoretical knowledge and  translate it
              into a usable element within a computerized decision-  making system or
              computer supported design environment.
