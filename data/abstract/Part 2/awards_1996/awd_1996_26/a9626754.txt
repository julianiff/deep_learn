Abstract    :
              9626754  BARBER         Duke University will not operate the R/V CAPE HATTERAS
              in  1996.  The vessel will be in lay-up status.  The HATTERAS is a 135' 
              general purpose research vessel constructed in 1981.  The ship is  owned by the
              National Science Foundation and operated by Duke  University.  The vessel had a
              very light scheduled for 1996.  For  greater efficiency of the fleet the few
              days that were scheduled on  Hatteras were switched to other vessels.  The
              Hatteras is now at  mid-life and is due for a mid-life upgrade.  During the
              lay-up  period the operator will start the engineering and mid-life refit.     
                The HATTERAS is part of a fleet of ships used by the National  Science
              Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most  oceanographic projects
              require highly specialized equipment be  permanently installed on the vessel,
              thus the necessity for  specialized ships.  These vessels do not operate in the
              same mode  as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the 
              operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated to  oceanographic
              research that are operated by universities and  institutions around the
              country.
