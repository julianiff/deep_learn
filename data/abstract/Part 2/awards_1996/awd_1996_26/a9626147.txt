Abstract    :
              9626147  Taylor    In this project the investigator continues her study of
              equilibrium and growth problems involving anisotropic surface free energy and
              mobility functions. She is developing new theoretical frameworks for
              considering such problems as well as creating new algorithms and programs for
              computing their solutions. The crystalline approach is to be used: the general
              idea behind this approach is that surfaces are composed of segments of planes,
              with fixed normal direction and with fixed adjacencies but with variable
              distance from the origin, and the motion of these segments is governed by a
              system of ordinary differential equations for the distances. This method may be
              considered as a variant of finite element method where the normal Gauss map is
              discretized.    It is expected that this research will advance the
              understanding of the role of surface free energy and kinetics in determining
              the shapes of surfaces and interfaces in materials as well as provide insight
              into the underlying mathematics. This will be accomplished in part by applying
              crystalline methods to explain observed microfaceting and other behavior in
              materials.
