Abstract    :
                The PI and his collaborators have been involved in: (a) some of the  subfields
              of theory that have witnessed impressive recent advances  (approximation
              algorithms, on-line algorithms), (b) a subfield that  has been very successful
              and relevant, but is facing new challenges  (database theory), and(c)
              ``exporting'' complexity-theoretic ideas  to other disciplines (e.g., Game
              Theory, Economics, and Artificial  Intelligence).   The goals of this project
              include: (1) The  deepening and broadening of recent advances in approximation 
              algorithms and on-line algorithms, by attacking fundamental problems  such as
              the Euclidean traveling salesman problem and the k-server  conjecture; (2) The
              study of alternative models and metrics, for  example, in relation to on-line
              algorithms for storage allocation,  that are closer to reality and to
              computational practice; (3) The  introduction of approximation and on-line
              problems that in a small  way contribute to our understanding of the
              computational  requirements of a global information environment; (4) The study
              of  database-theoretic problems that are posed by novel media and 
              heterogeneity; (5) The continuation of PI's research program that  considers
              problems from other disciplines (such as, Game Theory,  Genetics, and
              Artificial Intelligence) from a complexity-theoretic  point of view.***
