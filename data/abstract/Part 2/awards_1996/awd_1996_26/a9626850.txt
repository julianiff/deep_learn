Abstract    :
              9626850  Singh  This project was submitted to the "Structural Control for 
              Performance, Safety and Hazard Mitigation Research"  competition.  The main
              goal of this work is to examine and  develop a sliding mode control for its
              application to civil  structures.  The mathematical structure of this method 
              permits its application to linear and non-linear systems.  To this end several
              basic research question will be  addressed analytically and experimentally by
              the project  which is divided into several tasks.  The first task is to 
              develop optimal sliding mode controllers, including  frequency shaping and
              frequency domain approaches, both for  linear and non-linear systems; next task
              is to integrate  active control; and finally to verify experimentally the 
              developed control algorithms.  Results from this research  will lead to the
              development of experimentally verified  active and semi-active control methods
              to be applied to  civil structures for improving their performance and safety 
              under seismic and wind forces.  ***
