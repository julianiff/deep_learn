Abstract    :
                This project is a continuation of a multi-year effort to  discover and
              understand efficient data structures, combinatorial  algorithms, and the
              relationships between the two.  The emphasis  is placed on studying problems
              that are fundamental,  longstanding, and/or of significant practical
              importance.  Sought are not only specific algorithmic results, but also 
              general principles of design and analysis.  In particular, the  goals of the
              project include: (1) to devise specific algorithms  and data structures that
              result in more efficient solutions of  important combinatorial problems; (2) to
              study the worst-case  and typical-case performance of new and older methods, to
              allow  prediction of the best method for a given situation; (3) to  develop
              general tools and principles for design and analysis,  and apply these tools
              and principles systematically in the  construction of new algorithms and data
              structures.  Asymptotic  efficiency is not the only goal; methods are sought
              that display  simplicity and even elegance in addition to efficiency.  Success 
              is achieved when a method is found that is both theoretically  efficient and
              usable in practice.  The objective is not only  to devise new methods, but to
              gain greater insights into old  ones, so that all solutions can be stripped
              down to their  essence, achieving both greater efficiency and greater 
              simplicity.***
