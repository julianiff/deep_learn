Abstract    :
              Our understanding of mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems is based  on a few
              measurements of temperatures of the water and compositions  of the fluids.  The
              value of these measurements can be extended by  simulating the hydrothermal
              process with computer models that are  based on the physics of fluid transport
              and heat transfer.  The PIs  have developed computer models for this purpose
              and wish to extend  them to include the effects of crack formation.  These
              models will  attempt to duplicate changes in temperature and fluid chemistry 
              that have been observed.  In particular they will try to match  chemical and
              temperature measurements at the TAG hydrothermal field  with their computer
              models of the structure and water flow in the  mound.
