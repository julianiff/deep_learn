Abstract    :
              9626631  Ferrar    This grant supports a conference on Groups, Lie Algebras, and
              the Monster to be held at Ohio state University in the Spring quarter of 1996.
              The goal of the five day conference is to foster interactions between
              mathematicians from the area of group theory and lie theory. Topics to be
              covered include: quantum groups, vertex operators, modular lie algebras and the
              sporadic simple groups.    This is research in the field of algebra. Algebra
              can be though of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As such Algebra has
              direct applications to areas of physics and chemistry. In particular the modern
              theory of gauge fields in physics uses this area of algebra extensively. There
              are also connections to coding theory and the transmission of data across
              communication lines.
