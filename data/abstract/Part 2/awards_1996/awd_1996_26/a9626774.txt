Abstract    :
              Pierce  9626774    This is an award to support conduct of a conference to
              consider  advances in the knowledge-base supporting environmental  engineering
              practice that have been made by investigators who  have been supported by the
              National Science Foundation's "young  investigator" programs.  Starting with
              the Presidential Young  Investigators (PYI) initiative in 1984, NSF has
              supported a total  of 36 PYI's, NYI's (National Science Foundation Young 
              Investigators) and PFF's (Presidential Faculty Fellows) for a  total investment
              including matching funds from industry of almost  $5 million.  The diversity of
              research that has been conducted by  these investigators reflects the program's
              objectives to restore  contaminated environmental resources to useful quality
              and to  reduce adverse effects of solid, liquid and gaseous discharges  into
              land, water and air that impair their usefulness.    The product of this
              conference is expected to be used in planning  operation of the Environmental
              Engineering Research program as it  addresses outstanding issues in
              environmental engineering  practice.  Results are also expected to assist in
              advancing the  National Science Foundation's commitment to the core strategy of
               integrating research and education as articulated in its  strategic plan.
