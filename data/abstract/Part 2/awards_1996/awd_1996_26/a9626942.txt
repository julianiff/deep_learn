Abstract    :
              ***  9626942  Akse  This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project
              will result in the design, fabrication, and testing of an innovative
              chemiluminescence (CL) based prototype analyzer capable of continuous chlorine
              monitoring in water. This innovative new technology combines the intrinsic
              selectivity and sensitivity of CL with the reproducibility and ease of
              operation afforded by the use of solid phase modules for control of the pH,
              luminol concentration, and as a means to calibrate the analyzer. Solid phase
              beds eliminate the need for reagent preparation, and can be quickly and easily
              exchanged after long periods of operation (>30 days). Monochloramine, the most
              common interference in colorimetric analysis for chlorine, produces no CL
              response in the chlorine analyzer. Operation conditions, component hardware,
              solid phase bed design, and CL detection efficiency will be refined based on
              performance and commercial potential. Methods will be developed for
              quantitation of total chlorine and reagentless calibration. A prototype will be
              built and tested on real water samples forming the basis for commercialization
              of the technology.  Such an instrument will permit precise control of
              chlorination processes reducing the health risks caused by the formation and
              release of chlorinated by-products associated with over-chlorination,
              particularly in drinking water. Current analytical instruments are poorly
              suited to this task due to interferences, unstable reagents, time dependent
              responses, operator dependent results, poor reproducibility, and expense. The
              CL analyzer will meet the need for a sensitive, accurate, highly selective, and
              inexpensive instrument that is easy to use with a minimum of operator
              intervention.  ***
