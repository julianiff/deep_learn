Abstract    :
              9626130  Terng    The proposed research lies in the area of submanifold theory
              in differential geometry. The investigator plans to study submanifolds of
              complete Riemannian manifolds that have simple focal structures. In particular,
              she is interested in examining submanifolds with constant focal radii in
              compact Riemannian manifolds and taut immersions into complete Riemannian
              manifolds. In addition, the investigator is to engage in a collaborative
              project with K. Uhlenbeck on integrable Hamiltonian systems and their
              applications to harmonic maps and isometric immersions.    Submanifold theory
              is a vast and one of the oldest areas in geometry. Original motivation comes
              from surfaces in space, where a great deal of work was done prior to this
              century on constructing surfaces satisfying certain special properties, many of
              them having to do with curvature. The proposed research aims to delve into two
              of these special properties using modern techniques: surfaces with a simple
              focal structure, and surfaces admitting 'Bianchi-Backlund' transformations.
