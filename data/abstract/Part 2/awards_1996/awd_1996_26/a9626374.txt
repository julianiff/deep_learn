Abstract    :
              9626374  RABALAIS         The Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium
              (LUMCON)will  operate the R/V PELICAN during 1996 as a general oceanographic 
              vessel in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The PELICAN  is a 105'
              general research vessel constructed and operated by  LUMCON. The vessel is
              scheduled for 99 operating days in 1996, of  which 23 days are in support of
              NSF-sponsored programs.  The ship  operates primarily in the Gulf of Mexico.   
                   This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science  Foundation to
              support oceanographic research projects.  Most  oceanographic research projects
              require highly specialized  equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew
              members.  An  increasing number of research projects require equipment that
              must  be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship must be 
              specifically designed.  Such equipment also requires highly trained  crew
              members for maintenance and operation.  These vessels do not  operate in the
              same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and  therefore, NSF supports
              the operation of a variety of vessels  specifically dedicated to oceanographic
              research.  These vessels  are operated by universities and research
              institutions around the  country.
