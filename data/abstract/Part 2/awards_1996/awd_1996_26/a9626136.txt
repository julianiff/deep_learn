Abstract    :
              9626136  Corlette    This proposal lies in the area of Kahler geometry. The
              geometry of a quotient space of the group of diffeomorphisms of the circle will
              be studied; minimal Lagrangian surfaces in complex projective and quaternionic
              spaces will be studied; the topology of geometrically finite quaternionic and
              Cayley hyperbolic manifolds will be also be investigated.    Kahler geometry is
              the study of complex (sub-) manifolds equipped with a Kahler metric. A complex
              manifold is a curved space which looks locally like a complex number space; a
              Kahler metric then defines a distance function on the manifold compatible with
              its complex structure. It should be mentioned that many difficult  calculations
              are possible only with the introduction of a complex strucure; a Kahler
              structure makes it possible to interpret these calculations geometrically. This
              is a very active area within the field of differential geometry with
              applications to parts of modern physics.
