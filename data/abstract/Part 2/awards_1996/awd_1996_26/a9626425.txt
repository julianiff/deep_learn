Abstract    :
              9626425  Watson    The University of South Carolina requests support from NSF
              for connection to SURANET.  This grant will be used to help three campuses get
              access to the Internet.  The three sites are USC Lancaster, USC Salkehatchie
              and USC Union.  SURANET, a midlevel network in South Carolina, will provide
              operations management and  information services and it provides access to the
              Internet, a collection of interoperable networks connecting most research and
              education organizations in the United States.    The University of South
              Carolina campuses need the Internet connections to be able to access
              information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world.  The
              connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of the University of South
              Carolina  system as well as the community in general.
