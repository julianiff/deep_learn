Abstract    :
              9626598  Wong    This proposal lies in the general area of several complex
              variables, with an emphasis on Nevanlinna theory. More specifically, the
              investigator will work on non-equidimensional and higher dimensional value
              distribution theory and its applications to complex hyperbolicity. Unlike the
              one variable theory, higher dimensional value distribution theory involves
              sophisticated tools from complex differential and algebraic geometry, hence
              interfaces with several other areas of research within mathematical sciences.  
               Interest in Nevanlinna theory was recently revived in a dramatic way with
              Vojta's discovery of the analogies between it and Diophantine equations.
              Diophantine equations are equations in integers - an important part of Number
              Theory - and as evidenced by Fermat's Last Theorem are often very difficult to
              solve. Vojta's discovery indicates that several major results in Diophantine
              equations parallel those in Nevanlinna theory and that there may be hidden
              connections between the two theories.
