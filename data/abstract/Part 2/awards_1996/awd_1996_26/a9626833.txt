              Abstract  ATM-9226833  Bradley, Raymond S.   University of Massachusetts  Title:
              Patterns of Organized Climatic Variability    To gain insight into the possible
              causes and mechanisms of climate  variability, this project will identify the
              timescales, temporal  evolution, and spatial patterns of significant
              oscillatory and  episodic large-scale climatic variability recorded in proxy
              records  of climate spanning the last 500-1000 years.  The project will 
              specifically address questions related to long-term changes in the  tropical
              and extra-tropical patterns of interannual variability  that may be related to
              the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and  focus on the patterns of organized
              interdecadal variability and its  possible connections with lower-frequency
              ENSO variability, and  postulated century-scale climate oscillations
              (particularly in the  North Atlantic and surrounding continental regions) that
              may be  connected with the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation.   Advanced
              statistical tools will be applied to proxy data networks,  combining
              dendroclimatic, coral, historical, ice core and other  climate proxy
              reconstructions.  Attempts will be made to separate  out distinct indicators
              where possible (e.g. surface temperature  and precipitation) and to ensure
              proper calibration of the climatic  variability evident in proxy indicators. 
              Similar statistical  analyses will be made of the climatic field output of
              several long  general circulation model integrations.
