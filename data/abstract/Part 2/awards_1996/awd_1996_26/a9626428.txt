Abstract    :
              9626428 Cranston  ABSTRACT  The principal investigator attacks several problems
              in the general area of Stochastic Analysis. One problem is to come up with a
              coupling for diffusions with degenerate generators given by sums of squares of
              vector which satisfy Hormander's hypoellipticity condition. A related problem
              is to give a coupling proof of Moser's Harnack inequality. The principal
              investigator also uses coupling techniques on Brownian motion on Gromov
              hyperbolic spaces to estimate eigenvalues and gradients of harmonic functions.
              The principal investigator also studies relativistic Brownian motion. Finally,
              the investigator is deriving more results on the behavior of processes with
              dependence on the past.        The work in the current proposal falls into the
              general area of Stochastic Analysis. This means the analysis of  randomly
              evolving phenomena. The portions of this proposal on coupling are related to
              the smoothness of temperature distributions on surfaces, their rate of
              convergence to a steady state and the dependence of these on the geometry of
              the surface. The problems on processes whose behavior depends on the past have
              potential applications to economics (prices e.g.) and to biology (chemotactic
              phenomena.)  The work on relativistic Brownian motion can have potential
              applications to cosmology, especially in deciding whether it is possible to
              observe black holes.
