Abstract    :
              9626562  Pedersen       This project is mainly concerned with manifolds and
              their symmetries.  A manifold is a second countable Hausdorff topological space
              which is  locally homeomorphic to euclidean space.  There is quite a difference
               in studying manifolds in high dimensions and in low dimensions, and  this
              project is mainly concerned with high dimensional phenomena.  The  non-linear
              similarity problem is the question whether two  representations of finite
              groups can be homeomorphic without being  linearly ismorphic.  This question is
              high-dimensional in nature,  since it is easy to see that such phenomena cannot
              occur in dimensions  lower than four.  The other main part of this project is
              the Novikov  and Borel conjectures.  These conjectures are concerned with 
              classification of manifolds in high dimensions.  Classification is, of  course,
              interesting in all dimensions, but the methods are quite  different in high
              dimensions and in low dimensions.       The project has connections to many
              branches of mathematics, notably  to analysis.  The main methods used are from
              controlled topology, and  there are analogues of controlled topological
              problems in analysis,  notably through the Baum-Connes conjectures.  While high
              dimensional   manifolds are not readily accessible to our mind's eye, they
              arise  naturally in real-life situations whenever there are numerous degrees of
               freedom, as, for example, the space of all possible configurations of a 
              mechanical linkage with numerous joints and pivots.  ***
