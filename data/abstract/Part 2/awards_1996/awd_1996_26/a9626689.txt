Abstract    :
              9626689  Leung    The proposal lies in the area of complex differential
              geometry. The investigator proposes to compute Seiberg-Witten invariants for
              complex non-Kahler surfaces; to generalize Seiberg-Witten theory to include
              higher dimensional manifolds. Additionally, he is to investigate the
              relationship between the existence of Einstein-Hermitian metrics and stability
              of vector bundles a la Gieseker.    In 1995 Seiberg and Witten introduced a
              system of differential equations on four dimensional spaces and defined certain
              invariant quantities (they are solutions to these equations); this work
              significantly impacted the classification theory of smooth four dimensional
              curved spaces. The proposed research attempts to continue this line of
              investigation with an emphasis on those four manifolds that are not
              algebraically defined.
