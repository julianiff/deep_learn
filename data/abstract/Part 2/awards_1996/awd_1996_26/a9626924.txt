Abstract    :
              This project will analyze the water and carbon dioxide in basalt  glasses from
              four areas chosen to represent different mantle magma  sources.  Heavy isotopes
              and He-3 distinguish deep (primary) and  shallow (recycled) mantle-plume
              reservoirs.  Characterization of  the volatiles will contribute to
              understanding physical properties  and fractionation of the melts, as well as
              the degree of crustal  contamination resulting from recycling of
              subduction-zone material.
