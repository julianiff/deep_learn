Abstract    :
              9626721  Freire    The proposed research lies in the general area of Riemannian
              geometry. Specifically, the investigator wishes to pursue the following three
              topics: nonlinear partial differential equations of evolution type and their
              singular solutions; long time solutions to the wave equation; the topology of a
              manifold to the existence of harmonic differential forms.    Partial
              differential equations arise in many different contexts. In differential
              geometry, they can appear as so called Euler-Lagrange equations describing
              certain critical points of the energy functional defined on the space of maps
              between spaces. Certain solutions of these equations called harmonic maps (and
              wave maps in mathematical physics) then describe energy-minimizing maps that
              are often of physical significance.
