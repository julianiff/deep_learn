Abstract    :
              Dugatkin  9626637       The investigators use evolutionary game theory to study 
              cooperative behavior among animals.  They work toward a general  theory that
              categorizes cooperative behavior in nature as  kin-selected behavior,
              group-selected behavior, byproduct  mutualism, or reciprocal altruism.  In
              pursuit of this goal, their  investigation focuses on cooperative behaviors
              that can be  excluded on a priori grounds from the first two categories 
              mentioned above.  Examples of such behaviors are food sharing in  ravens and
              defensive behavior in lions.  Accordingly, the  investigators focus on
              reciprocity versus mutualism and develop a  mathematical model with the power
              to discriminate between these  two categories of cooperative behavior.  The
              model is important  because many examples of reciprocity in nature have been 
              hypothesized, but hardly any have been proven: without such a  model, virtually
              every example is equally interpretable as a case  of mutualism.       The goal
              of the study is to determine whether animals can  cooperate in nature because
              they keep score of favors done to --  and favors received from -- specific
              individuals, or because  acting in their long-term self-interest coincides with
              acting in  the best interest of their community, even though they do not  keep
              score.  From a purely scientific perspective, an answer to  this question will
              advance current knowledge of animal behavior  considerably.  From a more
              utilitarian perspective, even though  the study's primary subjects are
              non-human animals in the wild,  the investigators' findings will be relevant to
              achieving  cooperation among humans as well.  In particular, the study's 
              findings may help to solve the urgent problem of the commons,  i.e., the
              problem of designing cooperative social structures for  sustainable management
              of the global environment.
