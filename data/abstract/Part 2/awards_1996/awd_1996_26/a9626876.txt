Abstract    :
              Work was begun in 1950 on a descriptive illustrated flora to include the
              estimated 6000 species of vascular plants native in the Mexican states of
              Jalisco, Colima, and Aguascalientes, and parts of adjoining states. The first
              25 years included both extensive collecting in western Mexico and intensive
              study to produce treatments of the larger families. Publication of the Flora
              Novo-Galiciana began in 1983, and to date seven of the projected seventeen
              volumes have been published, treating almost half of all the species and
              genera, and a revised edition of the first volume, prepared by the Mexican
              botanist Patricia Davila, will appear late in 1996. The published parts deal
              with the conifers, the ferns and their allies, and the monocots, as well as the
              two largest families of dicots. No other area of Mexico of comparable size and
              floristic richness has a Flora that approaches such a degree of completion. 
              One goal for the next three years will be for the project's half-time artist,
              Karin Douthit, to finish illustrating one species in each genus for the
              remaining volumes, after which she will retire. Work already begun at the
              Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico on a database for plant specimens from
              western Mexico will also continue. The principal author, Rogers McVaugh, and
              the editor, W. R. Anderson, assisted by several collaborators, hope to complete
              two additional volumes of dicots during that period and make substantial
              progress on the text of a third.  |        H H     + (с?сG Р F G ( n     H H
