Abstract    :
              Michael Morse of the University of Utah is supported by the Experimental  
              Physical Chemistry Program to continue his investigations on the chemical  
              bonding and electronic structure of diatomic transition metal molecules   using
              electronic spectroscopy.  The methods to be employed include   resonant
              two-photon ionization spectroscopy, laser-induced and dispersed   fluorescence
              spectroscopies, and resonant two-photon pulsed field   ionization zero electron
              kinetic energy photoelectron spectroscopy.  In   all cases, the sample will be
              generated by pulsed laser ablation of the   appropriate metal target, followed
              by supersonic expansion.  The   expansion reduces the complexity of the spectra
              associated with the open   d subshell systems, facilitating interpretation of
              the spectra.  Research   will focus on the transition metal silicides, homo-
              and heteronuclear   transition metal diatomics, and on diatomic platinum.  In
              the latter   case, a detailed comparison to ab initio quantum chemistry will
              provide   an important test for relativistic theories of chemical bonding.   
              These studies will greatly enhance our understanding of the chemical   bonding
              between transition metals and will provide important tests for   the
              development of theoretical methods applicable to transition metal   systems. 
              For example, very little is known about the transition metal   silicon bond,
              despite the wide use of transition metal silicides in   microelectronic
              devices, solar cells,  infrared detectors and as   protective coatings.
