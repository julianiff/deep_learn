Abstract    :
              9626773  Bardet  This action is to support a US-Japan workshop to discuss the 
              geotechnical issues and lessons to be learned from the Great  Hanshin (Kobe)
              earthquake of January 17, 1995, and to establish a  blueprint for cooperative
              research and a strategic plan for  integrating the experiences of the Kobe and
              other recent major  earthquakes into improved engineering and planning
              practices.  The workshop is being held in Osaka, Japan, 22-24 January 1996.   
              The objective is to highlight the key geotechnical issues  involved and provide
              a mechanism for US-Japan cooperation in  initiating, completing and finally
              evaluating the information  gathered with the ultimate objective of improving
              understanding  and in developing methodologies and procedures to mitigate the 
              effects of future earthquakes.    This workshop is being organized by three
              Principal Investigators  at different institutions (the University of
              California at Davis,  the University of Southern California, and Cornell
              University),  thereby providing wider technical and  geographic coverage within
               North America and the increased ability to coordinate and work  with
              researchers in Japan. Several key researchers in Japan are  cooperating in the
              planning of this workshop.  It is also being  coordinated with similar
              activities investigating structural  engineering aspects of the Kobe
              earthquake.    Emphasis is placed on including as large a participation of
              North  American and Japanese participants as funding allows, in order to 
              provide the depth and breadth of knowledge and experience  necessary to
              accomplish the objectives of the workshop. These  participants include those
              who have initiated and completed many  research efforts as well as those who
              have put the results of  such research into practice.  ***
