Abstract    :
              9626685  Chow    The proposed research is in the area of geometric evolution
              equations: evolution of curves and surfaces by their curvature vectors,
              conformal flows of Riemannian manifolds, and the Ricci flow for metrics are
              among the topics to be pursued. The investigator will study Hamilton's Harnack
              inequality for the Ricci flow and other Harnack inequalities for geometric
              evolution equations with a view towards understanding the global behavior of
              solutions of Ricci flow under various assumptions on the geometry of the
              underlying manifold.    Geometric flows arise in numerous applications. In
              computer vision, curvature flows have been used to smooth images and enhance
              boundaries (expanding flows have received a great deal attention lately in the
              field of computer vision, where small bubbles are expanded to detect boundaries
              of images); the Gauss curvature flow models the wearing of stones by water
              waves and the process of making ball-bearings round by impacting at random
              angles. Also, the Ricci flow has been applied to classification problems in
              Riemannian geometry.
