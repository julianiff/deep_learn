Abstract    :
              DMS 9626784  Studden  This research is composed of two related parts:  one part
              deals  with the design of experiments and the other deals with canonical 
              moments in Statistics and Probability.  The research in the  design area
              involves the analysis of complex computer codes, the  use of rational functions
              in regression theory and the analysis  of rigid designs.  Complex computer
              codes are analysed  asympotically in order to optimally choose input values to
              use  for further prediction purposes.  The theory involves the use of 
              stochastic processes, multidimensional interpolation theory and  approximation
              theory. The second part involves the use of  normalized moments of
              distributions on the real line called  canonical moments. These have been used
              successfully in designing  experiments in one dimensional polynomial
              regression.  The  present study investigates some unanswered questions in
              moment  theory and random walks.  Experimental design problems in general
              involve how to choose  which experiments to conduct to obtain maximal
              information at  minimal cost.The present research involves the analysis of 
              complex computer codes where the problem is to decide on optimal  input values
              to predict the outcome at other possible input  values.  This relates
              significantly to high performance computing  which is one of NSF's current
              strategic areas.
