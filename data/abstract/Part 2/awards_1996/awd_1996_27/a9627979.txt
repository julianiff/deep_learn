Abstract    :
              9627979  Gole    This project uses variational techniques to prove the existence
              of orbits of many different topological types in conservative dynamical
              systems. In addition, the investigator will consider the method of frequency
              analysis introduced by J. Lasker and apply them to detect chaos and diffusion
              in conservative systems. One of the proposed goals is to give a firm
              mathematical foundation of Lasker's method, which at present is mostly a
              numerical method.    Chaos and diffusion phenomena in dynamical systems have
              wide ranging applications in the physical world. For example, they can be used
              to model certain weather systems involving turbulence and sudden bifurcation.
