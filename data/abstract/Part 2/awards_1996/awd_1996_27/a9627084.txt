Abstract    :
              9627084  Weiss    The New York Hall of Science will develop an interactive
              exhibit  for the general public "The Chemistry of Life".  There will be two 
              editions of the exhibit: one 2,500 sq. ft. version will be  installed
              permanently in the New York Hall of Science and another  1500 sq. ft. version
              will travel nationally.  Focusing on the  common chemical processes behind all
              life on earth, the exhibit  will help visitors learn four basic chemistry
              concepts: 1) a shared  chemistry underlies all forms of life, 2) the chemistry
              of energy  transformation takes place in all living things, 3) chemical energy 
              is converted to mechanical energy to animate life, and 4) the  chemistry of
              reproduction provides for the continuity of life.  The  chemistry of the human
              body will be used whenever possible as an  entry point to the concepts. 
              Exhibits will include a hands-on  staffed visitor chemistry lab, interactive
              activities,  stimulations, models, demonstrations, and video clips.  
              Complementary materials and workshops will be developed for  families, school
              groups, and teachers.  These materials are being  developed with the curricular
              needs of the New York State Systemic  Initiative and New York City Urban
              Systemic Initiative in mind.   Teacher and student materials will be keyed to
              the curriculum  guidelines.  The long-term exhibit is scheduled to open late in
               1998 and the traveling version will be available in spring 1999.
