Abstract    :
              9627179  Pickering     In this project, a variety of modeling techniques will be
              applied to the question of trace gas redistribution through deep convection.
              This work will be conducted in conjunction with the field project STERAO-A
              (Stratosphere-Troposphere Experiments: Radiation, Aerosols, and Ozone: Deep
              Convection and the Composition of the Upper Troposphere and Lower
              Stratosphere).  Prior to the field project, improvements to the Goddard Cumulus
              Ensemble Model will be made, such as increased vertical resolution. During the
              field experiment, the model will be run in forecast mode. The output will be
              used to provide guidance for flight planning.     Post-mission simulations will
              be used to compare calculations, initialized with experimental observations,
              with measurements obtained by the measurements on board the aircraft
              participating in STERAO-A. Tracer transport in convective events will be
              modeled, and the production of nitrogen oxides through lightning will be
              estimated using a parameterization scheme and compared to the airborne
              measurements of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide. The photochemical ozone
              production rates in cloud outflow will be modeled. The parameterizations of
              convective clouds and convective transport of trace gases in regional and
              global models will be evaluated based on the results obtained during the STERAO
              campaign.
