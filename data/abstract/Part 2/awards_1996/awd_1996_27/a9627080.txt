Abstract    :
              Although failures of meiosis are common, leading to a high rate of  spontaneous
              miscarriage in humans, little is known about the causes  of meiotic
              nondisjunction.  The goal of the project is to pool the  resources of two
              laboratories, one working on retroposons and other  working on meiosis, to
              study the role of transposable elements in  causing meiotic errors.  Although
              some previous studies suggest  that transposon movement may be the cause of
              spontaneous  nondisjunction in meiotic chromosome segregation, this will be the
               first test of the hypothesis.  This project will induce a high rate  of
              transposon movement and then assess the effect on meiotic  chromosome
              segregation, using both genetics and cytology.    Interactive activities
              include teaching undergraduates in both a  large and a smaller advanced class. 
              The interactive activities are  designed to advertise the ability of women to
              excel in academic  research.
