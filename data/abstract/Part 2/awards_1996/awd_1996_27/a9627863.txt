Abstract    :
                9627863  Evans  The PI proposes to perform deformation experiments on single-
              and two-phase calcite-  quartz aggregates under varying loading conditions, to
              characterize the resulting  microstructures, and to formulate flow laws
              (transient and steady-state) for the aggregates  using several theoretical
              models in order to provide a reliable methodology for  extrapolations.  The
              comparison of theoretical and experimental results should establish  guidelines
              for future studies on the deformation behavior of polyphase rocks in the crust
              and  mantle, and could aid in understanding a wide range of geological
              processes including the  distribution and focal mechanisms of earthquakes,
              lithospheric deformation and mantle  convection.  ***
