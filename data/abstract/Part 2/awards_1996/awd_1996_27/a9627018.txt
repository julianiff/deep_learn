Abstract    :
              9627018  Westrom    This is an after-school, informal science, engineering and 
              technical advancement program for students in grades four through  twelve. 
              FSEA brings together students, volunteer mentors from  business and industry,
              and teachers in activities centered around  members working in teams designing,
              building, and testing FSEA  hands-on projects making science, mathematics and
              technology "come  alive."  The goal for this project is to bring FSEA up to
              full  implementation status and to expand the number of FSEA chapters to  at
              least 300 and the number of students to at least 9,000.  The  anticipated
              outcome will be a national model implemented on a broad  scale whereby small
              and large businesses participate with local  schools in delivering technical
              education.
