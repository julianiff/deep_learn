Abstract    :
              Reconstructing and understanding past ocean circulation and heat  transport are
              central to establishing the causes and mechanisms of  long-term climate change.
               Ocean circulation directly influences  the global environment through the
              formation of ice, by influencing  oceanic and atmospheric CO2, and by heat
              transfer.  Ice and marine  records show millennial-scale changes in temperature
              and  circulation during the last glacial interval, suggesting climate 
              instability on very short time scales.    The high-sedimentation-rate cores
              recovered during ODP Leg 162  provide a unique opportunity to investigate the
              millennial-scale  stability of climate and thermohaline circulation over the
              last  three million years.  This will be accomplished by examining 
              sedimentological parameters which are influenced by climate and  current
              strength and comparing them to independently generated  isotopic and faunal
              records.  Four different climatic regimes will  be investigated; the 100 kyr
              dominated late Pleistocene world with  large marine based ice-sheets, the 41
              kyr dominated world during  the early Pleistocene and late Pliocene, and the
              mid-Pliocene warm  interval before initiation of the Northern Hemisphere ice
              ages.    Interactive activities focus on teaching a graduate course entitled 
              "Drift Sedimentation in Modern and Ancient Oceans," collaborating  with
              scientists at Cambridge University, and giving a lecture tour  to college
              students in the U.S. as a U.S. Science Advisory  Committee Distinguish
              Lecturer.
