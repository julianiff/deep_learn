Abstract    :
              9627459  Doniach  This grant further continues the support of this senior, 
              distinguished PI on the general problem of strongly  correlated electrons. 
              Specific projects in the present  grant include: Exact diagonalization of a t-J
              model using a  projector technique developed earlier by the PI,  properties  of
              a  superconductor-insulator transition utilizing a  generalization  of the
              Doniach-Inui lagrangian incorporating  both charge and spin fluctuations and
              effects of dissipation  and of high magnetic fields, and a dynamic mean field
              (the  infinite dimension limit) study of the Kondo insulators.  %%%  This grant
              explores several novel ideas about the properties  of Copper oxides in the
              range of doping where they are no  longer High Tc superconductors.  This is
              done with the hope  of elucidating the microscopic properties of these special 
              materials.  In another project the PI will study the Kondo  insulators
              (materials which are metallic and magnetic at  high temperatures and
              nonmagnetic and insulating at low  temperatures) using some recently discovered
              mathematical  techniques.  ***
