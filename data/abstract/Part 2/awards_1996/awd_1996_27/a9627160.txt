Abstract    :
              9627160  WALDEN              In 1996 Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will
              operate the  Deep Submergence Vessel ALVIN.  The submersible is certified for a
               depth of 4,500M and is designated a national asset.  The ALVIN is  supported
              by the research vessel ATLANTIS II (AII).  Both vehicles  have been operated
              effectively and safely by the institute for a  wide variety of NSF-sponsored
              research projects.  Through a  Memorandum of Agreement between ONR, NOAA and
              NSF the submersible  is operated in support of projects funded by these
              agencies.           The 1996 schedule for ALVIN is lighter than the vessel is 
              capable of performing with a projected operational schedule of 161  days.  Of
              these days 123 are proposed to support NSF-sponsored  programs.  NSF-supported
              cruises will take place in both the  Atlantic and Pacific in support of
              biological and marine geological  and geophysical research.         The ALVIN
              schedule is light due to the ABS and Navy  requirements for a major overhaul
              and recertification being  scheduled in 1996 for the DSV.  This overhaul
              normally requires  approximately 6 to 8 months to complete.  Since it will be a
              light  year for the submersible the use of remotely operated vehicles  (ROV's)
              will be used to provide deep submergence access to the  community.  Three
              cruises are scheduled for the WHOI DS/ROV's.  Two  of these cruises will be in
              the Pacific and one in the Atlantic.  ***
