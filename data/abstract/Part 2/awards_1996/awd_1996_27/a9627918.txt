Abstract    :
                Dr. Meek will explore the role of serum estrogen and neural estrogen receptors
              in the control of behavioral receptivity in the female meadow vole, a species
              without a regular, cyclic estrus.  Female meadow voles appear to have several
              different mating strategies (associated with different latencies to begin
              mating), which result in differential fertility.  Specifically, Dr. Meek will
              (1) determine if serum estrogen is correlated with the onset of behavioral
              receptivity in female meadow voles; (2) determine if there is a differential
              sensitivity to the behavioral effects of estrogen among female meadow voles
              with different latencies to begin mating, and (3) determine if there is a
              difference in the number, location, and/or intensity of staining of
              estrogen-receptor-immunoreactive cells among female meadow voles with different
              latencies to begin mating.  These preliminary experiments should lead to an
              exploration of GnRH immunoreactivity (GnRH-IR) in the brains of unmated and
              mated female voles that have different mating latencies, and which are housed
              in photoperiods simulating either summer (long daylengths, LD) or winter (short
              daylengths, SD).  An exploration of location, number and staining intensity of
              GnRH-IR cells in ovulating (LD) and non-ovulating (SD late-mating) meadow voles
              may provide information about how GnRH controls ovulation.  Since the
              neuroendocrine events leading to fertility are similar in all female mammals,
              it is possible that these experiments may lead to a greater understanding of
              how fertility can be suppressed or enhanced in other species, including humans,
              via similar mechanisms.
