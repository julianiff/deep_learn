Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to develop analytical techniques for  the platinum
              group elements (Ir, Os, Ru, Rh, Pt, and Pd) in oceanic  rocks at ultra-trace
              (as low as one part per 1012 parts) levels.   The ability to make accurate and
              precise measurements of the  platinum group elements in oceanic rocks at the
              ultra-trace level  is critical in order to refine models for mantle evolution,
              mantle  oxidation state, crustal recycling at subduction zones, and other 
              first-order processes.  Further progress in this field requires  that
              laboratory techniques be improved to lower the elemental  detection limits to,
              in some cases, below one part in 1012 parts.   Recent improvements in
              instrumentation have made these ultra-trace  element measurements possible in
              principle, but significant  refinements such as those proposed by the principal
              investigator  are needed in the associated laboratory techniques in order to
              make  these measurements practical.
