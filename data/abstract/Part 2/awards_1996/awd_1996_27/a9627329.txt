Abstract    :
              9627329  Javidi  A three day NSF sponsored workshop, "The Role of Optical
              Systems  and Devices for Security and Anticounterfeiting," is proposed.   This
              workshop will bring together thirty-four of the best experts  in the field to
              accomplish the following goals and objectives:    1. Discuss the recent major
              advances in the field.    2. Determine where the US stands in various R&D
              areas, including  applications, hardware, materials, components, devices, and 
              algorithms.    3. Determine both the short term and the long term major
              research  and development goals in the field.  Discuss what needs to be done 
              in the next five years, and what should be done in the next ten to  fifteen
              years.    4. Discuss strategies to accomplish the short and long-term goals, 
              including:         o Encouraging cross-disciplinary and joint research among   
                 algorithmic, systems integration, and materials and devices       research
              efforts to facilitate the deployment of optical       techniques in security,
              verification, and anticounterfeiting.         o Identifying
              industrial/commercial applications of optics and       optoelectronics
              security, verification, and anticounterfeiting       and discussing how more
              industrial/commercial funds can be       obtained for R&D.         o
              Determining how optics can complement the existing       electronics security,
              verification, and anticounterfeiting       techniques and processors.  ***
