Abstract    :
              Guttman  9627804  The Department of Statistics will purchase a server and X- 
              terminals to be networked with it.  This network is to be used by  faculty and
              graduate students involved in research and consulting  work. The equipment will
              be used for the following research  projects: (i) Sequential Experimental
              Design in Non-Linear Models  (I. Guttman & A. Mallik).  (ii) Bayesian Interim
              Analysis of Clinical Trials (G. D.  Papandonatos).  (iii) Model Selection
              Problems (J. Dmochowski).  (iv) Planning of Experiments and Rank Tests (M.M.
              Desu).
