Abstract    :
                        Faust  9627711   Studies of the chemistry of carbonaceous chondrite
              meteorites have focused on the stability of their volatile components (hydrous
              minerals such as serpentine) and organic material, such as amino acids,
              hydrocarbons, and fullerenes under shock conditions simulating those of meteor
              impact on an accreting terrestrial planet, and large impactor events, like that
              thought to have caused the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary extinctions.  The
              stability of these organic compounds during meteor impact is not well known,
              and is important in understanding the organic chemistry of the terrestrial
              planets during and after their accretion.  The NSF fellowship will be used to
              study the stability of organic molecules (such as biotic and abiotic amino
              acids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and fullerenes) in natural
              carbonaceous chondrites and analogous materials, using shock-wave and recovery
              techniques with Professor Ahrens at CalTech.  For the recovery experiments, the
              P.I. will use infrared spectroscopy to study the structure and content of the
              organic material in the recovered samples because it is an extremely sensitive
              technique to use when studying hydrogen and carbon bonds in organic matter and
              minerals.  The expertise in using infrared spectroscopic techniques will
              provide her with an excellent background with which to investigate meteoritic
              organic material, and knowledge of the behavior of hydrous minerals at high
              pressures and temperatures will also give her an excellent basis with which to
              understand their stability in meteorites under shock conditions.
