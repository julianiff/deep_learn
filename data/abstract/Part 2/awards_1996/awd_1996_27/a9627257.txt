Abstract    :
              ***  9627257  Maragakis  The objective of this project is the establishment of a
               "Bridge Research and Information Center".  The primary goals  of this center
              will be the following:         1.  To establish complete collection of
              information on  past; current and future research on a wide variety of  topics
              on bridge engineering.       2.  To use the latest computer technology for the 
              processing and storage of the information and its  dissemination to bridge
              researchers, engineers, consultants,  companies as well as institutions,
              libraries and other  similar organizations all over the world.       3.  To
              provide on-line video access of highlights of  major tests and experimental
              data.       4.  To continuously expand the center activities and to  respond to
              users; requests by making adjustments and  modifications to serve their needs. 
                The center will also conduct the yearly workshops for bridge  engineering
              through the  UJNR panel on wind and seismic effects.***
