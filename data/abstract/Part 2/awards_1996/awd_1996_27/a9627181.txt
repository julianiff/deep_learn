Abstract    :
              9627181  Hannibal    The Cleveland Museum of Natural History will develop an
              exhibit  that integrates earth sciences and planetary geology.  Currently 
              titled "The Hall of Earth and Planetary Exploration" this 8700 sq.  ft. exhibit
              will consist of a series of ten sections, each one  focusing on a different
              theme including "The Big Bang", "Plate  Tectonics", "Earthquakes and
              Volcanoes", "Ores and Mining", and the  like.  The goals are to instill
              curiosity about the Earth and  planetary sciences and their interrelationships,
              to invite deeper  exploration into scientific information and processes, to
              improve  general science literacy by organizing the information into 
              comprehensible themes, and to present an exhibit that is relevant  to the daily
              lives of the general public.  Visitors leaving the  exhibit should know about
              the uniqueness of the earth with its  moving continents, liquid water and
              living beings.  They will also  have some sense of the new scientific knowledge
              about the universe  and the solar system and have their desire piqued to
              explore these  topics further.  The exhibit will have a number of complementary
               components including brochures, an expanded docent program,  scheduled
              demonstrations and lectures by museum staff, devices for  physically disabled,
              teacher guides and workshops, and traveling  kits for schools.  The exhibit
              goals and complementary activities  align with Cleveland's Urban Systemic
              Initiative.  The exhibit is  scheduled to open late in 1997.
