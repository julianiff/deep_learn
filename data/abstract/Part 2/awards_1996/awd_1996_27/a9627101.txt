Abstract    :
              The research problem is to determine why transport in the region  between Hawaii
              and the California coast deviates substantially from  what would be expected
              from wind forcing alone (Sverdrup balance).   Possible reasons are significant
              errors in the wind stress field,  seasonal variations in the transport which
              are not resolved by the  measurements, forcing by surface heat fluxes, or
              strong ocean  fronts.  Several of these mechanisms are being examined using new
               data available from earth-observing satellites, and comparisons  with two
              quite different methods of analyzing ocean dynamics:   hydrographic
              measurements and numerical modeling of ocean  circulation.  Satellite wind and
              sea surface height observations  are being assimilated into a simple
              circulation model to separate  the effects of Rossby waves, seasonal heating,
              and wind forcing.    Interactive activities include teaching a graduate course
              on ocean  data and models, a workshop on balancing career and family, and 
              another workshop on careers in science education.
