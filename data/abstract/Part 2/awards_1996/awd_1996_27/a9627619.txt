Abstract    :
              This is a 3-year standard award. The need to merge different versions of an
              object to a common state arises in collaborative computing for several reasons,
              including optimistic concurrency control, non-WYSIWIS coupling, absence of
              access control, latecomers, and mobile computing. Current systems either
              support restricted forms of merging, or require programmers to completely
              implement merge procedures. The hypothesis of this research is that it is
              possible to automatically generate a large variety of merge procedures from
              high level specifications of these procedures. The project will investigate
              several issues that must be resolved to establish this hypothesis, including
              simultaneous merging of an arbitrary number of objects, merging of user-defined
              objects, realtime merging of user-interface objects, merging in a mobile
              environment, abstractions for specifying merge procedures, and the relationship
              between merging and other collaboration functions such as concurrency control.
              It is uses an experimental method wherein the new concepts are implemented and
              used in validation experiments. If successful, it will allow merging to become
              a common operation in a collaborative environment without requiring significant
              application-specific programming.
