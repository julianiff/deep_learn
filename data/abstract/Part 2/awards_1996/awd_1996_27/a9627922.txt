Abstract    :
                The original World-Wide Web (WWW) architecture--which requires a network 
              connection from a client to a possible distant server for each document 
              retrieved--is not scalable.  Servers and network have limited bandwidth  that
              cannot keep pace with continuing growth in Web usage, particularly as  the
              popularity of bandwidth-intensive media types, such as video, grows.  This
              project addresses Web scalability by characterizing WWW traffic and  applying
              that characterization to design and evaluating algorithms to cache  and
              prefetch documents within networks.    The project has five objectives: to 1)
              collect traces from four disparate  traffic sources; 2) prepare to handle the
              large volume of collected traces  by extending methods to collect, visualize,
              analyze, and model Web traffic  using the Chitra trace analysis tool; 3) use
              techniques from objective two  to characterize Web traffic based on the traces
              collected for objective  one; 4) develop a predictive model and simulation of
              clients, servers, and  Web traffic in the context of universities and community
              networks that  permits the design and evaluation of algorithms for in-network
              document  caching to reduce the bandwidth requirements of Web servers and
              networks.  The simulation will use results from workload characterization. The
              model  will allow a network manager to place and configure in network caches
              (e.g.  proxy servers) within an existing network; and 5) design and evaluate, 
              through simulation, algorithms to prefetch documents, thereby partially  hiding
              latency.
