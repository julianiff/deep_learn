Abstract    :
              This research explores two phases in the rise of the research  school of
              bimolecular crystallography at Oxford, the only research  school in
              international renown led by a woman, and the only such  school to include a
              critical mass of women members.  Led by Dorothy  C. Hodgkin (1910-1994), a sole
              Nobelist in chemistry (1964), this  research school distinguished itself by
              successfully solving the  structure of a series of biological compounds of
              increasing  structural complexity, including the sterol (sex hormones) in the 
              late 1930s; penicillin (the miracle drug for infectious diseases,  especially
              in WW2) in the 1940s; vitamin B-12 (the factor needed to  prevent pernicious
              anemia) in the 1950s; and insulin (the hormone  regulating sugar metabolism) in
              the 1960s.  This project focuses on  the relationship between molecular and
              social complexity in the  work on the structure of penicillin (1940s) and
              vitamin B-12 (the  1950s), phases in which women were key members of the
              research  teams.    First, the project explores the gender dimensions of this
              research  school, while focusing on: a) the recruitment and retaining of 
              members of both sexes in a research school led by a woman, at a  time very few
              women persisted in science, let alone in positions of  authority; b) the career
              patterns of the women members, in and out  of a school in which they both had a
              distinguished role model and  a "critical mass".  this part of the project can
              offer important  historical lessons for framing a science policy agenda to
              foster  gender equality in 21st Century science.    Second, the project
              clarifies the social processes of cross-gender  collaboration and the
              scientific outcomes involved in the  transition from the X-ray crystallography
              of "small" biological  molecules to that of large macromolecule (proteins and
              DNA), a  transition crucial for our understanding of the molecular  revolution
              in 20th Century biology.    Interactive activities include: teaching a new
              research seminar on  "History and social implic ations of molecular biology and
               biotechnology" for one term; teaching a new undergraduate course on  "New
              direction in the history of women in science" for another  term, and organizing
              a workshop on "Science policy or social policy  for women in science: From
              historical case-studies to an agenda for  the 21st Century".
