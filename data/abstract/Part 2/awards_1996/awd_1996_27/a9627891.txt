Abstract    :
              9627891  Olson      The PI proposes to conduct laboratory fluid dynamics
              experiments  with applications to flow in the Earth's mantle and core.  The PI 
              will study experimentally the convective processes responsible for  the seismic
              anisotropy that has been detected in the upper mantle  and in the inner core,
              and will also investigate thermochemical  convection in liquid metal subject to
              the influences of rotation  and magnetic fields, with application to the
              geodynamo.  The  experimental results will be compared with both numerical 
              calculations of magnetoconvection and with the flow patterns in the  outer
              core.  Measurements of the elastic and electrical anisotropy  of solid gallium
              crystallizing in the presence of convection,  rotation and magnetic fields will
              be compared with observations of  inner core anisotropy as a test of theories
              for the growth of the  inner core.  ***
