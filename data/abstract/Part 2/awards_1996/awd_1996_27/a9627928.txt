Abstract    :
              9627928  Biondini  The objective of the proposed research is to investigate how
              the competitive ability of plants is linked to an interaction between their
              root scaling properties and the supply rate and scaling properties of soil
              resources. The operating hypothesis is that: (1) nutrient supply rates and the
              spatial scaling of soil nutrients are two equally important and interactive
              constraints to plant growth; and (2) plants contend with these constraints
              through a trade-off in the way they scale root biomass to total rooting volume,
              root surface density, and root proliferation. Testable hypotheses were derived
              from a model that relates the competitive ability of plants to the interaction
              between the scaling properties of their root system and the scaling properties
              of the resources they utilize. The protocols for testing the proposed
              hypotheses involve two sets of experiments. The first is designed to determine
              the root lateral spread, root length, root density, and the distribution of
              root surface areas of selected plants in the presence and absence of nutrient
              patches. Plants will be grown in containers with grid panels located at fixed
              intervals designed to keep roots in place once the soil is removed. Nutrient
              patches will be generated by Sierra slow release fertilizer prills. Roots will
              be sampled by grid depth, separated based on fertilizer location, digitized,
              and analyzed for the desired parameters with a Delta-T Scan imaging system. The
              second set of experiments will test how the spatial distribution and supply
              rate of nutrients can affect plant competition. The experimental system
              consists of a 3x12x0.3 m growth container equipped with 3,600 trickle
              irrigation emitters arranged in a grid pattern at 10 cm intervals. This system
              is designed to control the spatial scaling, and supply rates of nutrients. Each
              emitter is controlled by one of 10 Dosatron injectors that delivers the desired
              amount of nutrient within a lOxlO cm area. The design has the capability of
              generating spatial patter ns as well as independent or simultaneous time
              patterns for nutrients and water delivery. All experiments will be organized as
              2x3 factorials. Factor 1 will consist of 2 spatial scaling factors for either N
              or P. Factor 2 will consist of 3 mean N or P supply rates. N and P will be used
              to account for differences in mobility and buffer power among soil nutrients.
              Each of 5 replications will consist of 400 plants from 10 species (40
              plants/species) with distinct root scaling patterns selected from the root
              architecture experiment. To test the repeatability of results, each experiment
              will be conducted twice with two distinctly different combinations of 10
              species.
