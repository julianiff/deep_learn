Abstract    :
              9627460  DeWitt       B. DeWitt from the University of Texas will study methods
              to  develop a quantum theory of gravity and elementary particles  without the
              use of `ghost fields', local fields which have  traditionally been incorporated
              in the field theory description  of high energy physics.  Ghost fields were
              originally included in  order to preserve as much symmetry as possible in the
              theory,  since this allows ease of calculation.  A ghost-free description  will
              be useful in providing us with a theory which only involves  physical degrees
              of freedom at all stages of the calculation.    This work is part of a
              successful program to bring gravity and  elementary particle physics on a more
              equal conceptual footing,  thereby enhancing our deeper understanding of both
              fields.  ***
