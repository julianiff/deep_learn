Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9627899  William Haynes  NIST    As part of a seven month
              sabbatical leave period, the investigator proposes to collaborate with the
              National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) - Thermophysics Division
              in defining improved theoretical and experimental methods to evaluate the
              physical properties of dilute solutions, especially as applied to environmental
              parameter evaluation and related applications.  This type of data is essential
              in the design of "clean" chemical manufacturing processes and prediction of
              pollutant fate and transport.  Unfortunately, little is currently being done to
              correct the lack of reliable data in the dilute regime.  In turn, the lack of
              carefully measured experimental data impedes the development of robust and
              accurate ostimation methods.  In light of these deficiencies, filling this need
              has been identified by NIST and the investigator as an area of significant
              national importance for both industry and government.
