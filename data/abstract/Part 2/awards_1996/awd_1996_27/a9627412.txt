Abstract    :
              9627412  Ando   Matthew Ando received his doctoral degree from the Massachusetts
              Institute of   Technology and will pursue research under the guidance of
              Michael J. Hopkins at the   Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The research
              is in elliptic cohomology, in   particular with its relationship to other areas
              of mathematics such as homotopy theory and   conformal field theory.  %%%   The
              Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships are awards to   recent
              recipients of doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. These awards are a
                means of contributing to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the
              nation. As   researchers in the mathematical sciences expand their interactions
              with other disciplines,   and as the interplay increases between the various
              areas of mathematics itself,   opportunities for postdoctoral research and
              training are becoming increasingly important.   The Fellowships are designed to
              permit awardees to choose research environments that   will have maximal impact
              on their future scientific development. The fellowship is   designed to provide
              24 months of support divided into 18 academic-year months and three   periods
              of two summer months. The recipient may choose (1) the Research Fellowship  
              option which allows for full time support for any 18 academic year months in a
              three year   period, in intervals not shorter than 3 consecutive months or (2)
              the Research   Instructorship option which allows the 18 months of academic
              year support to be taken as   nine months of full time support and 18 months of
              half time support. Not more than two   months of summer support from this
              Fellowship may be received in any calendar year.  ***
