Abstract    :
              9627266  Cavanagh    The project is based upon the established Math, Science,
              and Beyond  (MSB) program which consists of a series of evening family science 
              workshops (with curriculum materials developed for classroom  settings) in
              which students and parents explore science and  mathematics together through
              exciting, hands-on activities.  Units  for each grade level (K-6) focus on
              physical, earth, and life  science.  The MSB informal science project will
              adapt materials and  bring the program to informal learning settings - 25 Boys
              and Girls  Clubs of California, and 25 California Department of Parks and 
              Recreation sites.  These clubs will receive training, materials,  and support
              to operate Science Clubs (after school MSB sessions),  Science Camps (summer,
              off-track and Spring/Winter Break, week-long  MSB sessions), and Science
              Explorers Family Workshops (1-2 hour  sessions for elementary school students
              and their parents).  In  addition to the Boys and Girls Clubs, and the
              California Department  of Parks and Recreation, the California Science
              Implementation  Network is a key collaborator on the project.
