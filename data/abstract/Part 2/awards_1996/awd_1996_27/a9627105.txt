Abstract    :
              9627105  Slovin    The American Museum of the Moving Image (AMMI) will develop
              and distribute a traveling version of their permanent exhibit, Behind the
              Screen.  The project, which consists of a 4,000 to 6,000 square foot traveling
              exhibit and related educational materials, will focus on the science and
              technology underlying movies and television, including motion, light and
              optics, sound, electricity and magnetism, chemistry, and geometry/trigonometry.
               The exhibit also will examine the impact of advances in the technology of
              movies and television and the resulting impact on audiences and society.     
              The PI will be Rochelle Slovin, founding director of the AMMI.  Carl Goodman,
              Curator of Digital Media, and Richard Koszarski, Head of Collections and
              Exhibitions, will serve as exhibit content specialists.  The integration of
              science principles and activities into the exhibit will be under the direction
              of Ted Ansbacher, a physicist who previously served as Director of Exhibits at
              the New York Hall of Science.  Thom Thacker, Director of Education at the AMMI,
              will be responsible for the development of educational outreach material.
