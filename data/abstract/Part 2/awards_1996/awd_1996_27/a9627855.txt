Abstract    :
              9627855  Barazangi        This research is a collaboration between Cornell
              University and  Moroccan and Spanish research institutions to map crustal and
              upper  mantle seismic structure in the convergent continental plate  boundary
              between Africa and Iberia.  This complex deformation  boundary is active today,
              as evidenced by both shallow and  intermediate depth seismicity, and includes
              the Moroccan Rif and  Spanish Betic interplate mountain belts, which constitute
              the  Gibraltar Arc, and the Alboran Sea.  A number of competing models  have
              been suggested to explain the apparent coeval development of  these striking
              arcuate fold and thrust mountain belts and the  neighboring Alboran basin since
              the early Miocene.  Possible models  range from trapped microplates to
              subduction or delamination.   Combined digital seismic networks in Spain and
              Morocco  (installation of the latter was in part supported by NSF funding) 
              provide 49 stations for data analysis.  Precise earthquake location  and focal
              mechanism determination along with 3-D seismic velocity  and attenuation
              mapping will be used to discriminate among the  competing models of
              deformation.  ***
