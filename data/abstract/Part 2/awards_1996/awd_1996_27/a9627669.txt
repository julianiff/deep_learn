Abstract    :
              The purpose of this proposal is to provide funding for the continued analysis of
              the Longitudinal Study of American Youth (LSAY) in regard to (1) student
              science achievement, (2) student mathematics achievement, (3) student career
              plans, (4) the influence of informal education, (5) the influence of student
              access to and use of computers, and (6) the influence of systemic factors on
              student outcomes.  The project will allow the completion of a CD-ROM that will
              include the full seven years of data, graphic images of all of the tests, and
              questionnaires used in the study, and full documentation concerning the
              collection and processing of the LSAY data.  The grant will recode for
              secondary analyst through workshops and on-line assistance.  the grant will
              produce one monograph and several submissions to refereed journals of papers
              that have been initiated but not completed.
