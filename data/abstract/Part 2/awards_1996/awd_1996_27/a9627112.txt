Abstract    :
              9627112  Hamilton    The Science Museum of Minnesota will develop "Buildings: A 
              Traveling Exhibit and Permanent Installation with Education and  Outreach
              Programs".  This is a multifaceted project that includes  a 5,000 sq. ft.
              exhibit that will explore the science, technology,  and human perception of
              buildings.  The exhibit will tell three  stories: 1) buildings must obey
              physical laws to stay up, 2)  buildings are complex operating systems, and 3)
              buildings reflect  and shape the societies that create them.  The exhibit will 
              initially be developed as a traveling exhibit that will circulate  among the
              member institutions of the Science Museum Exhibit  Collaborative (8
              institutions) and then it will be reinstalled in  the new SMM $77 million
              building.  Additional partners  collaborating on this project include the
              National Building Museum,  the Society of Building Science Educators, Habitat
              for Humanity  International, The ReUse Center, the Vital Signs Program and the 
              Center for City Building Education.  Special attention will be  given to
              reaching girls and women and the physically challenged.   A broad menu of
              public programming is planned and school-linked  materials will be developed.
