Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry
              Program, explores the interfacial chemistry of polymers  on solid surfaces
              using surface Raman spectroscopy as the primary  tool.  The work focusses on
              the interaction of polyimides  deposited on copper and chromium surfaces, and
              on their oxides.   A molecular understanding of the bonding interaction is the
              goal  of these studies, which will help to explain properties of these  polymer
              metal systems such as adhesion.  Additionally, an  important goal of this
              project is the elucidation of the chemical  mechanism of the surface enhanced
              Raman process.  Connections  will be made between the electronic structure of
              surface adsorbed  species as probed by high resolution electron loss
              spectroscopy  and the Raman enhanced spectra of a series of molecules adsorbed 
              on silver, copper, and gold surfaces.  The study of the interfacial chemistry
              of polymers adsorbed on  metal and metal oxide surfaces is the focus of this
              project  supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program.  The 
              polyimide on copper system, an important one in electronic  materials
              processing applications, is the primary interface  investigated.  Raman
              spectroscopy will be used to probe this  interface, and an additional focus of
              the work is the development  of a detailed understanding of the chemical
              mechanism of surface  Raman enhancement.
