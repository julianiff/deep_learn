Abstract    :
              9627358  MacPherson       This award provides partial support for a graduate
              student in the  mathematics department at Princeton University, working on a
              Ph.D. thesis  under the direction of Robert D. MacPherson, a permanent member
              of the  Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, N.J.  MacPherson's current 
              research covers a wide area, including the geometry of symmetric spaces  in
              relation to Langlands theory, combinatorial topology, perverse sheaves  and
              toric varieties.  He has had a large number of successful students.  ***
