Abstract    :
              9627624  Hayden  The proposed workshop will be held at the University of
              Wisconsin, Madison, from 18-20 July 1996. The workshop will 1) detail the
              programmatic similarities and differences in Land-Margin Ecosystem Research
              (LMER) and the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) programs, 2) evaluate the
              scientific merits for a LTER and LMER merger, 3) evaluate the administrative
              merits for an LTER and LMER merger, 4) evaluate the special needs of each
              program, 5) assess the means and procedures for merger of the two programs, and
              6) prepare a report to NSF with recommendations concerning the future
              management of LMER with respect to the LTER program. It is anticipated that the
              results of this workshop will serve as a means to guide to future directions in
              long-term coastal research, and promote the synergism between LTER and LMER
              research programs.
