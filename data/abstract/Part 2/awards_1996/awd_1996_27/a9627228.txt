Abstract    :
              This proposal's immediate objective is measuring the solar wind near the Sun
              using radio remote-sensing techniques.  The PI's observations made under a
              previous grant suggest the main acceleration of the fast polar streams takes
              place closer to the Sun than previously expected.  In addition, prior
              observations show a component of enhanced density fluctuations at scales just
              above the proton Larmor radius.  Both of these results are important for the
              heating of the corona and acceleration of the solar wind, but they will have to
              be confirmed by additional observations.  This research will primarily
              contribute to a fundamental understanding of the Sun in general and solar wind
              in particular; i.e., space weather forecasting.  Moreover, the techniques
              employed may be useful for the study of the marine boundary layer, important
              for short range radio communications over the ocean.
