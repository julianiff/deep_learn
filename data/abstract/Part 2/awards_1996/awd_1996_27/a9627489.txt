Abstract    :
              9627489  McCuan   John E. McCuan received his doctoral degree from Stanford
              University and will   pursue research under the guidance of Craig Evans at the
              University of California at   Berkeley and David Hoffman and Robert Osserman at
              the Mathematical Sciences   Research Institute. The research is on the geometry
              and stability of prescribed mean   curvature surfaces.  %%%   The Mathematical
              Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships are awards to   recent recipients of
              doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. These awards are a   means of
              contributing to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation. As 
               researchers in the mathematical sciences expand their interactions with other
              disciplines,   and as the interplay increases between the various areas of
              mathematics itself,   opportunities for postdoctoral research and training are
              becoming increasingly important.   The Fellowships are designed to permit
              awardees to choose research environments that   will have maximal impact on
              their future scientific development. The fellowship is   designed to provide 24
              months of support divided into 18 academic-year months and three   periods of
              two summer months. The recipient may choose (1) the Research Fellowship  
              option which allows for full time support for any 18 academic year months in a
              three year   period, in intervals not shorter than 3 consecutive months or (2)
              the Research   Instructorship option which allows the 18 months of academic
              year support to be taken as   nine months of full time support and 18 months of
              half time support. Not more than two   months of summer support from this
              Fellowship may be received in any calendar year.  ***
