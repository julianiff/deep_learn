Abstract    :
              9627856  Umhoefer   The Puget Lowland, Washington, is in the fore-arc region of
              the Cascadia convergent margin, where the Juanda Fuca plate is obliquely
              converging beneath the North American plate. Associated deformation occurs
              along the subducting plate boundary or Benioff zone and also in a wide, complex
              region of the upper (North American) plate extending across Northern
              California, Oregon, Washington and Southwestern British Columbia. Several
              models have been proposed to explain Quaternary deformation in the Cascadia
              margin, but present field data is inadequate to evaluate these models. This
              project will examine how slip on an active fault in the vicinity of Seattle
              continues to the South. The work is a pilot project to determine if surface
              exposures and seismic data will be adequate to test a model that suggests that
              the Seattle fault is part of an integrated, regional thrust system under the
              entire Puget-Lowland. If successful, the results will provide a much needed
              model framework for understanding this transtensional tectonic environment,
              which will also provide a focus for risk assessment.
