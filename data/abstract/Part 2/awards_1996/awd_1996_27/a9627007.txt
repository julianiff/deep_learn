Abstract    :
              9627007  Muraski-Stotz    The Field Museum will develop a 10,000 sq. ft. exhibit
              "Life  Underground: Foundations of the Biosphere."  This exhibit will 
              introduce visitors to underground ecosystems and the importance of  soil upon
              which we all depend.  Visitors will be invited to explore  the diversity of
              underground organisms and the vital processes in  which they participate.  It
              will consists of three main parts: 1)  Underground Expedition, where things
              will be enlarged 100 times  life-size; 2) Changes Over Time, which will
              highlight the dynamic  nature of soil communities and forces of change, and 3)
              a World  Tour, which will compare soil communities from a variety of 
              ecosystems including forests, grasslands, deserts, tundra, among  others.  The
              exhibit utilizes ideas and research from all four of  the museum's academic
              disciplines -- botany, zoology, geology and  anthropology and will incorporate
              hundreds of specimens from the  museum's botany, mycology, and zoology
              collections to illustrate  the diversity of organisms in and around the soil. 
              Complementary  educational programming will be developed and the project is 
              especially targeting rural and inner city residents.  School and  community
              programs will extend the exhibit into classrooms, vacant  lots, and community
              centers.  The materials developed for use in a  formal education setting will
              be integrated with current objectives  of the existing curricula.  In addition,
              on-line access to the  content of the exhibit and complementary educational
              materials will  be provided.  The scheduled opening date for the exhibit is
              May,  1998 and during the ten year projected life span of the exhibit and 
              complementary programming, it is expected that more than eight  million people
              will be introduced to :Life Underground."
