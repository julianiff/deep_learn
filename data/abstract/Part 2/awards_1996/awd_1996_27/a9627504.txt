Abstract    :
              9627504  Kleinberg   Jon M. Kleinberg will receive his doctoral degree from the
              Massachusetts Institute   of Technology and will pursue research under the
              guidance of Eva Tardos at Cornell   University. The research is on routing
              problems in networks; in particular, it deals with   approximation algorithms
              for NP-hard problems arising in the context of routing disjoint   paths between
              nodes in a network.  %%%   The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research
              Fellowships are awards to   recent recipients of doctoral degrees in the
              mathematical sciences. These awards are a   means of contributing to the future
              vitality of the scientific effort of the nation. As   researchers in the
              mathematical sciences expand their interactions with other disciplines,   and
              as the interplay increases between the various areas of mathematics itself,  
              opportunities for postdoctoral research and training are becoming increasingly
              important.   The Fellowships are designed to permit awardees to choose research
              environments that   will have maximal impact on their future scientific
              development. The fellowship is   designed to provide 24 months of support
              divided into 18 academic-year months and three   periods of two summer months.
              The recipient may choose (1) the Research Fellowship   option which allows for
              full time support for any 18 academic year months in a three year   period, in
              intervals not shorter than 3 consecutive months or (2) the Research  
              Instructorship option which allows the 18 months of academic year support to be
              taken as   nine months of full time support and 18 months of half time support.
              Not more than two   months of summer support from this Fellowship may be
              received in any calendar year.  ***
