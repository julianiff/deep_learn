Abstract    :
              9627037  Nadella  This proposal deals with the fundamental problem of n-type
              doping of diamond.  Ion Implantation will be performed to create shallow donors
              for electronic conduction in the range of 100 KeV to 1 MeV with dosages in the
              range of 1E13 to 1E16/cc.  After annealing at elevated temperatures the dopant
              profiles will be analyzed with SIMS,  RBS, C-V and Hall techniques.  Diamond
              has the potential to offer high power, high temperature electron devices.  ***
