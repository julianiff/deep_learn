Abstract    :
              9627879  BAUMANN  Aphids and many other plant-feeding insects are dependent on
              specialized bacteria, called endosymbionts, that live within cells and that are
              transmitted from the mother insect to her  offspring. The best documented
              function of endosymbionts within aphids is the provision of the essential
              nutrient, tryptophan. Because aphids do not ingest tryptophan in their diets,
              they depend on their endosymbionts to provide this nutrient. Thus the bacterial
              genes that underlie tryptophan production are critical to the growth and
              reproduction of the insect host. This study examines the evolution of the
              endosymbiont genes underlying tryptophan production in aphids.  Previous work
              has indicated that these genes show an unusual pattern of accelerated evolution
              in the endosymbionts of certain aphid species. This project uses methods of
              molecular biology to test explanations for the variation in evolutionary rates
              in this gene.  Because endosymbionts are an essential component of many crop
              pests, including such groups as aphids, whiteflies, and scale insects, this
              study will contribute to fundamental knowledge that could ultimately lead to
              progress in pest management.  Agricultural entomologists have suggested that
              the short-term evolution of endosymbiont traits that affect insect performance
              is important in the origin of new strains of pest species. This study will be
              one of the first to directly examine evolution within endosymbiont genes that
              are critical to insect survival and reproduction.
