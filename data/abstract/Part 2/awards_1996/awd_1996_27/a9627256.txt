Abstract    :
              96-27256  Silva    This Research Equipment Grant is for the purchase of a 
              digital recording  oscilloscope for the Marine Geomechanics Laboratory at the 
              University of  Rhode Island.  A triaxial compression testing system,  purchased
              under NSF  funding and matching funds agreements, has been enhanced  with the
              addition  of a geoacoustic system, including transducers, a wave form 
              synthesizer,  amplifier and power source.  This grant will permit purchase  of
              a digital  oscilloscope necessary to extend system capabilities to  include
              compression  and shear wave velocity measurements and attenuation  evaluation
              under a  wide range of carefully controlled conditions.  Such  measuremelts are
               required as key parameters needed for geoacoustic modeling  of ocean 
              sediments.    ***
