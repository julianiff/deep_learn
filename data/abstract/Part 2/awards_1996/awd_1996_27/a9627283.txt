Abstract    :
              9627283  Rothman    This grant is to partially support travel of U.S. Scientists
              to the 21st International Conference on Mathematical Geophysics to be held on
              June 16-21, 1996, in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  The conference meets every two
              years in different countries and is sponsored by the Committee on Mathematical
              Geophysics of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics.  The
              conference themes will be 1) Fundamental problems in geophysical fluid
              dynamics, 2) Imaging and modeling complexity in the Earth's deep interior, 3)
              Natural Hazards: theory and phenomenology, and 4) dynamical structure of
              complexity in the earth sciences.  ***  ??
