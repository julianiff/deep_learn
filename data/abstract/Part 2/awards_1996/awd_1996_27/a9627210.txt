Abstract    :
              A fundamental problem in parallel computing is to design  high-level,
              architecture independent, algorithms that  execute efficiently on general
              purpose parallel machines.  The purpose of this project is to advance our
              understanding  of the main factors required for designing practical  parallel
              algorithms and to develop techniques and data sets  for experimentally
              validating the results. As a byproduct,  portable parallel programs and data
              sets for a number of  specific important problems arising in combinatorial 
              computing and image processing will be developed and made  available to other
              researchers through the PI's Web page.  There are currently two factors that
              make this fundamental  problem more tractable. The first is the convergence of 
              parallel architectures toward a unifying model and the  second is the emergence
              of standards such as the message  passing standard MPI. The technical approach
              to be followed  is based on (1) a simple computation model that incorporates 
              communication costs into the complexity of the algorithms,  and (2) a SPMD
              programming model that makes effective use of  communication primitives.  ***
