Abstract    :
              Shin, Michael  U. of Colorado, Boulder   This proposal uses a geographic
              perspective to examine the nature, formation and succession of political
              attitudes and behavior in central Italy.  The focus is on two major parties of
              the Italian left and how contextual effects or the numerous social, economic
              and political processes and interactions occurring within and between places
              influence attitudes and behavior.  The major question to be addressed is what
              political and social mechanisms and processes lie behind the concepts of
              neighborhood effect and forced field bias.  The research will develop a
              methodological framework for identifying and evaluating contextual effects. 
              The study will utilize archival census and election data to assess major
              spatial effects in behavior.  Both aggregate statistical analysis and
              regression modeling will be used to examine the spatial relations that exist
              within and between communes, along with the attributes of the voters of each
              commune, to understand political support in central Italy.  Surveys and
              interviews in 20 to 25 communes will be undertaken to obtain local-level
              comparisons of social processes and influences on political behavior. The work
              will contribute to a theory of contextual effects with respect to political
              behavior by identifying important influential social processes.  In addition it
              will present a methodology that detects, identifies and evaluates such effects
              and which can be replicated elsewhere.
