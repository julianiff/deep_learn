Abstract    :
                9627668  Bayliss    The Department of Engineering Sciences and Applied
              Mathematics and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of
              Northwestern University propose to purchase a Hewlett Packard computational
              server which will be dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical
              sciences.  The equipment will be used for several research projects, including
              in particular:  1) Numerical study of filtration combustion with application to
              materials systhesis.  2) Numerical study of pattern formation and nonlinear
              dynamics in gaseous combustion.  3) Numerical study of pulse propagation in
              optical storage rings employing parametric amplifiers.  4) Laminar flamelets in
              turbulent combustion.  5) Flame propagation in tubes.  6) Flame spread over
              liquid fuels.  6) Flow in unsaturated porous media.  7) Stability of foam flow
              in porous media.  The principal investigator is A. Bayliss.  Co-principal
              investigators are W. L. Kath, M. Matalon, B. J. Matkowsky, and M. J. Miksis. 
              Northwestern University has agreed to contribute 50% of the cost of the
              equipment.
