Abstract    :
              9627909  Davis   The Yinshan fold and thrust belt of northern China lies within
              the Mesozoic North China plate and is not clearly related to any of the three
              convergent margins of  that plate that were active in Mesozoic time.   This
              research is aimed at understanding the causes of this belt forming so far away
              from these margins, and whether the voluminous magmatism can be related to such
              distant subduction processes.  Results may help understand other enigmatic
              orogenic belts that occur within plates but lie at considerable distances from
              the plate margin.
