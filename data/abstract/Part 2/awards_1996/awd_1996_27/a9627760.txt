Abstract    :
              9627760  Wilson   David B. Wilson will receive his doctoral degree from the
              Massachusetts Institute   of Technology and will pursue research under the
              guidance of Alistair J. Sinclair at the   University of California at Berkeley.
              The research is on the development and analysis of   algorithms which use the
              theory of Markov chains to produce random samples from large,   finite sets. 
              %%%   The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships are awards to
                recent recipients of doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. These
              awards are a   means of contributing to the future vitality of the scientific
              effort of the nation. As   researchers in the mathematical sciences expand
              their interactions with other disciplines,   and as the interplay increases
              between the various areas of mathematics itself,   opportunities for
              postdoctoral research and training are becoming increasingly important.   The
              Fellowships are designed to permit awardees to choose research environments
              that   will have maximal impact on their future scientific development. The
              fellowship is   designed to provide 24 months of support divided into 18
              academic-year months and three   periods of two summer months. The recipient
              may choose (1) the Research Fellowship   option which allows for full time
              support for any 18 academic year months in a three year   period, in intervals
              not shorter than 3 consecutive months or (2) the Research   Instructorship
              option which allows the 18 months of academic year support to be taken as  
              nine months of full time support and 18 months of half time support. Not more
              than two   months of summer support from this Fellowship may be received in any
              calendar year.  ***
