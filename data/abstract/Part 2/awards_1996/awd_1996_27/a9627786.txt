Abstract    :
              9627786  Krimm  The goal of this proposal is the application of a new form  of
              potential energy function to the study of structure,  spectra, and dynamics of
              polymeric macromolecules.  The PIs  have developed a method of transforming
              scaled ab initio  force fields into molecular mechanics energy functions so 
              that vibrational frequencies as well as structures and  energies are preserved.
               An advantage of this so-called  spectroscopically determined force field
              (SDFF) is that it  permits reliable normal mode calculations to be made on 
              different conformations of a macromolecule.  In addition,  because of its
              spectroscopic accuracy, it should result in  more physically meaningful
              molecular dynamics simulations.  The PIs have already implemented the SDFF
              approach for  polyethylene, and shown that it leads to more accurate 
              predictions of the elastic modulus of this polymer.  This  proposal extends
              this method to the development of SDFFs for  other polymers, in particular
              branched systems, olefinic  systems, and the nylons.  The PIs have also
              developed an  electrostatic model for the prediction of infrared band 
              intensities, which will be incorporated with the SDFFs.  Elastic moduli will be
              calculated for these polymers, as  will molecular dynamics simulations of some
              of these  systems.  %%%  The use of SDFFs in structural and spectroscopic
              studies of  polymers can be expected to result in more reliable  predictions of
              their physical properties.  This will enhance  the power of computational
              approaches in polymer science.  ***
