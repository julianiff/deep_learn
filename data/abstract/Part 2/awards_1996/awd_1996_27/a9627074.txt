Abstract    :
              This research includes two projects to study the influence of  chromosome
              structure on chromosome behavior and gene expression in  Drosophila.  The first
              project focuses on the pal and K81 proteins  which are required to stably
              maintain paternal chromosomes during  embryogenesis.  To analyze their
              mechanism of action, their  subcellular localization is being followed during
              spermatogenesis  and embryogenesis, using hybrid proteins generated by fusions
              with  the fluorescent GFP marker.  Methods to mark sperm DNA will be  developed
              to track paternal chromosome behavior in K81 mutant  backgrounds.  For the
              second project, the organization of a large  chromosomal domain is being
              studied through the structural analysis  of a genetically well characterized
              region of heterochromatin.   Molecular mapping and selected cloning of
              sequences within this  heterochromatic region should allow specific DNA
              sequences to be  correlated with the functional properties of heterochromatin. 
                Interactive activities include:  teaching a graduate course,  informal
              interactions with faculty and students, and organizing a  workshop for graduate
              students and postdocs that focus on issues  that affect their training and
              career choices.  The workshops are  intended to stimulated productive
              discussions and offer practical  solutions to problems young scientists may
              encounter at different  stages of their careers.
