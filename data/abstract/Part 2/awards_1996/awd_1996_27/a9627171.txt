Abstract    :
              9627171  Sadler    The Science Education Department of the Harvard-Smithsonian
              Center for Astrophysics will produce and evaluate a pilot for a series of after
              school television program targeted at youth aged 9 -12.  The series, which is
              based on the research into children's misperceptions about science conducted by
              the applicant, will help viewers make sense of often poorly understood or
              misunderstood science principles.  The project will be highly interactive
              through the use of the Internet and 800 numbers.  In the television series,
              viewers will see "evidence" for different ways to interpret basic science
              concepts and will be called upon to make sense of the key evidence, conduct
              further investigation on their own, and register their findings via the
              Internet and World Wide Web or by calling an 800 number.  In response to the
              viewer's verdict, local stations will air either a "guilty" or "innocent"
              resolution -- both of which will clarify the science concept being considered. 
                The PI for the project will be Philip Sadler, Director of the Science
              Education Department at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.  The
              Project Manager will be Matthew Schneps, Director of the Science Media Group. 
              Education and science content will be the responsibility of Hal Coyle, a
              science teacher and curriculum developer, and Roy Gould, an Education
              Specialist at the Center.  The principal science advisor will be Irwin Shapiro,
              Director of the Center for Astrophysics, and the chief educational advisor will
              be Charles Whitney, Prof. Emeritus Harvard University.  The video will be
              produced in cooperation with Terra Associates in New York.
