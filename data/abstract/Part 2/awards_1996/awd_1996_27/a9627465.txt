Abstract    :
              Abstract  9627465  Sawyer    The combustion Institute holds biennial
              international meetings for presentation of the latest experimental and
              theoretical results across the spectrum of Combustion Science and Engineering. 
              The 1996 meeting will be held on July 28 - August 2, 1994 at the University of
              Naples, Italy.  The Combustion Institute encourages outstanding scientists and
              engineers to participate in the symposium and assists young investigators in
              attending.  This has maintained a higher level of activity and interest in
              combustion than would have otherwise existed.  The Symposium proceedings will
              be published; funds are being supplied to help offset these costs.
