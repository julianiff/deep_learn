Abstract    :
              9627091  Wahl    The project conducts action research to learn more about how 
              different groups use technology in meaningful ways, develops  approaches that
              significantly increase access for underrepresented  groups, and proposes ways
              in which technology might be modified or  redesigned to engage, address, and
              represent diverse populations.   The project targets children and young people
              from groups  underrepresented with technology, informal and formal educators, 
              community groups and organizations, researchers, policymakers and  funders,
              industry, and the public.  Products include: a report on  the state of access
              of underrepresented groups to technology; case  studies; guides to increasing
              community access to technology;  guidelines about how to be critical viewers,
              users, and makers of  technology; report on the issues involved in producing
              diverse and  equitable technology design; exemplars and ideas for diversifying 
              technology design; suggestions for software publishers and  industry;
              commissioned papers on issues of access and design for  particular
              underrepresented groups; an agenda for action; and  interactive World Wide Web
              site; and a popular press book that  synthesizes the knowledge gained through
              this project.
