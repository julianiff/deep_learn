Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                           This projects explores problems in
              the area of approximation  algorithms, with emphasis on two themes:  (1)
              Primal-dual  schema based on approximation algorithms; and (2)  Approximation
              algorithms for problems in network design.  First, several problems are
              investigated that appear to have  ``optimal'' approximate solutions using
              primal-dual schema,  including generalized Steiner network problem, integral 
              multicommodity flow and multicut in trees, the set cover  problem, and the
              k-minimal Steiner tree problem.   The second  goal of the project is to provide
              ``good'' approximate  solutions to problems, identified by AT&T Bell Labs and 
              Bellcore, in the area of implementation and maintenance of  low-cost broadband
              networks.***
