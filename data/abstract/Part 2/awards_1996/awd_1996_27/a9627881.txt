Abstract    :
              Gardner, Florence  U. of California, Berkeley   This doctoral dissertation
              proposal examines the use of temporary employment within two European companies
              located in their home sites to that use in transplanted sites in the
              Greenville-Spartanburg area in South Carolina.  The research will be conducted
              through two comparative case studies.  The first case study will compare the
              use of temporary employment in the home facilities of BMW and Michelin Tire and
              their transplant facilities in Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina.  The
              second case study will compare the use of temporary  employment in transplant
              facilities of these two companies to that of the indigenous textile industries
              of several companies in the same area.  Data on workforce, job categories,
              employment variation, wages and gender-sex will be gathered through
              semi-structured interviews with personnel managers, union officials, permanent
              workers, and temporary workers at each site.  The work will contribute
              generally to the topic of economic restructuring but more specifically to
              industrialization through foreign direct investment in the use of contingent
              employment relations by identifying the regional variation in the use of
              temporary work and the locality dependent dimensions of this use.
