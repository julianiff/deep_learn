Abstract    :
              9627829  Frost  This pilot study will concentrate on the relations of the LTV
              mine in the Biwabik iron formation. With increasing grade, individual siderite
              layers in the aureole become oxidized to magnetite. The PIs will attempt to
              determine the process by which this oxidation occurred. Carbon and oxygen
              isotopes will be used to determine whether the formation of the magnetite was
              preceded by simple oxidation or by formation of metastable methane. Each
              process should produce a distinctive isotopic signature. Ion microprobe
              analyses of the silicates and carbonates will be performed o determined the
              temperature and fluid compositions that were present at the time of oxidation.
              The magnetite-hematite relations in low grade rocks will also be investigated.
