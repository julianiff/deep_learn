Abstract    :
              9627672  Greschler    The Computer Museum will develop two 2500 sq. ft.
              computer-based  exhibits the "Virtual Fishtank: Splashing Into Complex
              Systems".   One exhibit will be installed permanently in the Computer Museum 
              and the other will travel nationally for three to five years.   These exhibits
              will use computer modeling of fish to introduce the  public to new ideas about
              complex systems science and demonstrate  the central concept that complex
              behaviors and patterns can emerge  from simple interactions among simple rules.
               Visitors will spend  eight to ten minutes designing their own fish at one of
              the ten  FishBuilder computer stations.  As they make decisions, they will  be
              able to observe the effects of their rule selections on a  computer display. 
              When satisfied with their design, visitors can  then "tag" their fish by
              placing their initials on fish tails and  launch them in the central
              "fishtank".  Large projection screens  will encircle visitors in a dramatic
              simulation of an underwater  aquarium environment.  Visitors will observe and
              analyze how the  few simple rules imbedded in the design of individual fish
              give  rise to complex behaviors and patterns in the entire ecosystem.   This
              exhibit draws on research conducted at MIT's Media Lab, The  Computer Museum,
              and the New England Aquarium and will be able to  reach people with a variety
              of learning styles.  It anticipated  completion date is March, 1998 for the
              TCM's version and the  traveling version will begin it's national tour in
              September, 1998.
