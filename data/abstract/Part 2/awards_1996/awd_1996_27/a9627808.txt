Abstract    :
              McElhinney  9627808  The PIs propose to construct a Global magnetostratigraphy
              database as recommended  by the International Association of Geomagnetism and
              Aeronomy (IAGA).  The PIs will incorporate data collected worldwide including
              the former Soviet Union through a collaboration with Russian scientists.
