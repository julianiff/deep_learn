Abstract    :
                9627858  Reilinger    The PIs propose a multi-national collaboration to
              quantify  contemporary deformation of the Eastern Mediterranean region using 
              measurements from the Global Positioning System (GPS).  They will  incorporate
              existing GPS data from their former campaigns from  1988-1994, and will
              reoccupy and collect new data in September of  1995.  They will also install a
              number of permanent sites in the  region.  The new information resulting from
              this study will help  quantify rates and styles of deformation in the region,
              thereby  constraining models for lithospheric rheology and dynamics in this 
              and similar collisional settings.  ***
