Abstract    :
              PINKHAM  DMS-9627870  The Department of Mathematics at Columbia University will 
              purchase Unix workstation equipment which will be dedicated to  the support of
              research in the mathematical sciences.  The  equipment will be used for several
              research projects in the areas  of algebraic geometry and number theory,
              including in particular:   a project by David Bayer on toric methods for
              integer and mixed  programming, a project by David Bayer on Galois
              representations  and Hecke eigenclasses of congruence subgroups, a project of 
              Ramanujachary Kumanduri on primarity testing and factoring using  modular forms
              and a project of Dan Lieman on the use of  automorphic forms to construct
              cryptographic systems.
