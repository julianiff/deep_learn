Abstract    :
              Dr. Bunny C. Clark's research in nuclear theory represents an  extension of
              ongoing efforts to develop relativistic descriptions  of a wide range of
              nuclear reactions and nuclear structure (e.g.,  global optical potential,
              nuclear densities, meson-nucleus  scattering, inelastic reactions).  The
              results of this work have  already proved useful to experimental groups around
              the world.    Interactive activities include working with the internationally 
              recognized physics education research group, P.E.G., headed by  Professor
              Lillian McDermott; and participating in the activities of  the group including
              the inservice teacher program and the  innovative inquiry-based tutorial
              program for calculus-based and  algebra-based physics courses.  In addition,
              Dr. Clark will  organize a series of seminars and meetings with women faculty, 
              postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students at the University of  Washington.
