Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Smith of the  
              University of Notre Dame is investigating the chemistry of organoboronic  
              acids with regard to carbohydrate isomerization, membrane transport, drug  
              delivery, and as anion receptors. The major focus of the investigation is   to
              facilitate the conversion of glucose to fructose by using boronic   acids that
              are highly selective. Additional efforts are directed at   concentration
              enhancement through the use of membrane transport complexes   that are highly
              selective for fructose.  New classes of organoboronic acid derivatives are
              being investigated for   their ability to selectively facilitate the
              isomerization of glucose to   fructose. Further, these boronic acid derivatives
              are being investigated   as reagents for selective membrane transport of
              fructose, as reagents for   the analysis of catecholamines, as drug delivery
              vehicles, and anion   receptors in Lewis acid catalysis reactions.
