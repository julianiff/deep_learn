Abstract    :
              SBR-9627842  Judith Kenny   Rina Ghose  U. Wisconsin, Milwaukee    This
              doctoral-dissertation improvement award supports a study of in-migrants to a
              non-metropolitan county in Montana.  The investigators propose that the kind of
              migration occurring in this case differs from more common patterns of migration
              from metropolitan areas in the wealth and the motivations of the in-migrants. 
              They will compare migrants' origins, motivations, and socio-economic
              characteristics to these patterns in a process that has been called "rural
              gentrification," a phrase most often used in British research on a
              perhaps-similar British experience in the past 20 years.  They will also
              compare the Montana and the British experience in terms of the results of
              in-migration on public and private resource ownership and use.  The Student
              intends to make use of Census records, real-estate-sales records, and
              questionnaires and interviews with in-migrants and other inhabitants of the
              county.    The research reflects the fact that particular areas of the American
              West are changing rapidly because of an influx of professionals who can either
              work far away from their actual clients or markets or who can spend much time
              and money away from their work-related residences.  The geographic literature
              in the United States does not include much study of these changes from a
              cultural and social perspective.  This study should be important both in
              interpreting these trends based on one case, and in catalyzing further research
              in this area.
