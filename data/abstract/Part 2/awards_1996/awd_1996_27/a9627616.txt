Abstract    :
              This project would analyze reform in the Scottish secondary curriculum in
              mathematics, science, and English to learn about the limits and possibilities
              of raising standards and increasing access to national curricula and
              examinations.  The investigator proposes to follow students to age 19 to see
              whether the standardized curriculum reduced inequality in the transition form
              secondary to higher education.
