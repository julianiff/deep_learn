Abstract    :
                  The goal of this project is to facilitate and enhance the match between user
              needs  and the capabilities and products of the emerging space weather service.
               It is noted  that it is necessary for the success of an applied program that
              the requirements of the  eventual users must be introduced into the planning of
              the program at an early stage.   To facilitate this, this program will involve
              establishing a close working relationship  between engineers and operators in
              the user community and space scientists and  forecasters.  This will be
              accomplished through workshops.  Activities will focus on  seeking areas where
              1) a close match between needs and capabilities already exist,  2) better
              understanding of the capabilities and needs can generate more easily 
              achievable matches, and 3) finding new areas where space weather service can be
               usefully applied.  The output of this program will be suggestions of specific 
              applications where either near term implementation or more detailed feasibility
               studies should be considered.
