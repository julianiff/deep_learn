Abstract    :
              This research which makes use of topological methods and insight to  obtain
              results in combinatorics, is being enhanced by the full-year  programs in
              combinatorics and low-dimensional topology at  Mathematical Sciences Research
              Institute (MSRI).  Research  activities are centered at MSRI, and Dr. Lynne M.
              Butler is on the  program committee for the workshop on enumeration and
              partially  ordered sets and is giving a series of lectures on this topic at 
              MSRI's introductory workshop.    Interactive activities engage her with
              postdoctoral researchers,  graduate students at the University of California -
              Berkeley, and  local high school teachers.  They include teaching a UC-Berkeley
               graduate course in Coxeter groups, mentoring and supporting the  women
              mathematicians (undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral) in  Berkeley's
              Noetherian Ring, and experimenting with outreach to high  school teachers
              during MSRI's introductory workshop.
