Abstract    :
              This research involves foundational research on algorithms for NP-  hard
              problems.  The primary research area is DNA computing.  A  careful study of
              models and algorithms for DNA computation provides  a basis for assessing
              whether DNA computing is viable.  This  research will provide new, massively
              parallel algorithms for NP-  hard problems that may be useful on other
              computing models.   Another contribution will be analysis of error-prone
              computation.   Research will also be carried out in the area of approximation 
              algorithms.  The goal is to extend the range of applicability of  the
              semidefinite programming relaxation method of Goemans and  Williamson to an
              NP-hard timetabling problem that typically arises  in high schools.    The
              interactive activities to be undertaken include:  teaching a  senior-level
              undergraduate course in theoretical computer science,  giving several research
              presentations in departmental seminars,  doing collaborative research with
              faculty in Computer Science and  Engineering and Molecular Biotechnology, and
              serving as an advisor  for an NSF-funded project on development of mentor
              training  packages.
