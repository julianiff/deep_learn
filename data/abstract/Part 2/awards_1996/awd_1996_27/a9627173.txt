Abstract    :
              In order to attain further insight into the nature of the human  language
              faculty, this linguistic and psycholinguistic research  involves integration of
              results from basic cross-linguistic  research in the area of first language
              acquisition with results  from parallel research in the area of second language
              acquisition.   The is being led by hypotheses and methods deriving from current
               linguistic theory, and typological cross-linguistic studies as well  as by
              insights from current studies of language pedagogy.    Interactive activities
              involve:  mentoring graduate students and  undergraduates; teaching a graduate
              seminar; and developing a  workshop at the Linguistic Society of America (LSA)
              Summer  Institute 1997, a symposium for the American Association for the 
              Advancement of Science annual meeting, and a workshop on female  mentorship in
              linguistics at the LSA Institute.
