Abstract    :
              9627274  Wilkinson  The proposed conference is on the fundamental science that
              will  enable materials with predetermined properties to be designed  from a
              quantitative understanding of the relationship between  microstructure and
              properties.  The conference format involves  primarily invited speakers with
              approximately one-half of each  session devoted to an in-depth discussion.  In
              addition, a poster  session will be held that will enable other attendees to
              present  their work.  %%%  The proposed conference is on the fundamental
