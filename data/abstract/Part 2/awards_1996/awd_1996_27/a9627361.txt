              CTS - 9627361  Edward Cussler  Frank Bates  University of Minnesota    ABSTRACT 
                    The proposal aims at building membranes for gas separations whose
              surfaces feature submicron-sized corrugations.  The corrugations will be
              achieved by surfactant-directed self-assembly and also self-assembly of block
              copolymers.  The first approach involves interfacial polymerization at a
              "middle phase" interface to improve selectivity and increase flux.  The second
              approach utilizes block copolymers that self-assemble into corrugated
              structures.  In particular, polystyrene-polyisoprene diblock copolymers of
              different volume fractions of the blocks will be used to obtain various
              microstructures.  The results may lead to significant improvement of flux in
              selective membranes.
