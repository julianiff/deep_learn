Abstract    :
              Read, Jane  Louisiana State University   Land-cover change detection in
              northeastern Costa Rica will provide spatio-temporal data of human impacts on a
              tropical forest environment.  The objectives are to identify causes and effects
              of human activities on land cover and identify a method using remote sensing
              and geographic information systems (GIS) to detect local land cover changes in
              the study area, which comprises two protected areas in the province of Heredia.
               The use of selected remote sensing/GIS methods using Landsat data for three
              dates from 1970 to 1990 will take place at both the base institution and in the
              field.  Change maps developed from these analyses will be quantitatively
              assessed against change maps derived from field observations, aerial
              photographs, maps and literature sources.  The study will improve understanding
              of the performance and accuracies of standard remote sensing/GIS techniques for
              assessing land cover change detection in tropical forest environments.  It will
              also enlarge our knowledge of human impacts upon the environment in a global
              context.
