Abstract    :
              9627324  Deines  It is one of the aims of the planned work to examine whether it
              is possible to establish a chronological       18O record of mantle fluids
              through a combination of oxygen isotope measurements with other isotopic and
              geochemical investigations of kimberlitic zircons.  From the Jagersfontein
              kimberlite, South Africa, a suite of xenoliths for which an origin in the
              transition zone and below can be postulated, has been collected by Dr.
              Haggerty, University of Massachusetts.  These samples provide a unique
              opportunity to examine the, as yet unknown, oxygen isotope geochemistry of this
              part of the mantle.  The P.I.s plan to carry out a systematic oxygen isotope
              study on these very deep mantle samples.  Studies are planned in three
              different, but related, settings.  The P.I.s will carry out:  1. An examination
              of the oxygen and radiogenic isotope record of zircons from the Jwaneng and
              Orapa kimberlites.  Dr. N. Shimizu, Woods Hole Institute of Oceanography, who
              will carry out the geochronological work and trace element measurements on
              zircons.  2. An investigation of the oxygen isotopic composition of silicate
              inclusions in diamonds from Orapa.  The measurements of the nitrogen content
              and aggregation state of the host will be coordinated with Dr. J. W. Harris,
              University of Glasgow.  3. A detailed oxygen isotope study on deep mantle
              xenoliths.  This part will be coordinated with petrographic, mineralogical and
              geochemical studies  by Dr. S. E. Haggerty, University of Massachusetts.   All
              stable isotope studies will be carried out under the supervision of the
              principal investigator.  The work will show whether it is possible to develop a
              tool for the study of the chronology of mantle fluids, and aid in the
              characterization of fluids present during diamond formation.
