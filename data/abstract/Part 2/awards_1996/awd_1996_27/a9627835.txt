Abstract    :
              Manga  9627835  Quantitative values for properties of geological materials at
              high pressure and temperature, such as those obtained in the diamond anvil cell
              (DAC), are essential for understanding the present state and the past evolution
              of the Earth.  The PI proposes to develop a set of 1- and 3-dimensional models
              of the temperature distribution in the  DAC for a range of experimental
              configurations.    Results obtained from the combination of experimental data
              with theoretical analyses will be applied to the Earth, and implications for
              the composition and thermal structure of the mantle and core will be studied.
