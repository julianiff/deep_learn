Abstract    :
              The National Academy of Engineering has initiated a series  of annual symposia
              called "Frontiers of Engineering".  The  meetings are designed to bring
              together a select group of  the nation's best young engineers from industry,
              academe,  and government laboratories to discuss pioneering technical  work and
              leading edge research in various engineering fields  and industry sectors.  The
              goal of the symposia is to  introduce the nation's outstanding young engineers
              to each  other, and through this interaction facilitate collaboration  in
              engineering and the transfer of new techniques and  approaches across fields.  
               The First Annual Symposium on Frontiers of Engineering was  held September
              12-23, 1995 at the Academies' Beckman Center  in Irvine, California, being
              sponsored jointly by the  National Science Foundation, the Department of
              Defense, the  National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the 
              Engineering Foundation.
