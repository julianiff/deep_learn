Abstract    :
              The research centers on d6 polypyridyl assemblies, capable of  serving as
              catalysts in photoinduced energy conversion schemes.   The assemblies are
              modeled after the photosynthetic reaction  center, wherein spatial separation
              of the opposite charged holds  and electrons is used to avoid the "short
              circuiting" recombination  reaction.  Kinetic study of the photoinduced
              electron transfer in  simple systems, requiring time resolved laser
              spectroscopy, will  underpin the goal of transferring the holes and electrons
              across  the assemblies containing novel relay molecules.  The  photochemistry
              of assemblies containing centers capable of  catalyzing chemical energy
              conversions will be explored.    Interactive activities focus largely on
              undergraduates.  A primary  goal is to provide students with maximal personal
              interaction with  role models.  Interactions include research mentoring and
              academic  advising, and teaching an enriched section of a general chemistry 
              course integrated under the theme of "energy and the environment".   A variety
              of prominent women in the sciences will be invited to  serve as additional role
              models.  A peer womentoring program will  be initiated among the graduate and
              undergraduate students.  The  latter represent an extensive group of potential
              role models and  mentors for younger students.
