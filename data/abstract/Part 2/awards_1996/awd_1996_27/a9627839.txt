Abstract    :
              9627839  McDowell    This grant provides $17,000 as partial support of  the
              costs of acquiring components to upgrade the  Potassium-Argon geochronology
              laboratory in the  Department of Geological Sciences at the  University of
              Texas.  Specifically, turbomolecular  pumps will be purchased to replace
              antiquated and  potentially hazardous mercury diffusion pumps used  to maintain
              a vacuum within the sample preparation  lines and the physical components of
              the sample  preparation line will be rebuilt.  This laboratory  is presently 25
              years old and these upgrades will  allow this lab to maintain a safe and viable
               future program of research utilizing K/Ar  geochronology as applied to studies
              of the  magmatic history of northwestern Mexico and the  tectonic and magmatic
              history of Irian Jaya in  western New Guinea.  ***
