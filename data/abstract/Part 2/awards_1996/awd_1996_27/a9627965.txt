Abstract    :
                The research objective is to enable one to systematically design  hierarchical
              algorithms for data compression that outperform sequential  data compression
              algorithms. The methodology first involves finding  hierarchical algorithms
              that yield good theoretical performance in  compressing sufficiently large data
              sets.  Then, computer experiments shall  be performed in which hierarchical
              algorithms selected on the basis of  theory are tested versus sequential
              algorithms in compressing archival test  and image files.  Hierarchical data
              compression algorithms based on string  rewriting systems, wavelets, and
              iterated function systems shall be  principally considered.  This development
              of hierarchical data compression  theory and practice may have significant
              impact on the development of  personal communication technology.
