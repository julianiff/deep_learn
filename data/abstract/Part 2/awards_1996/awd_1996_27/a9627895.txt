Abstract    :
              9627895  Marone      The PIs propose to study the frictional properties of
              simulated  faults under the temperatures, pressures, and fluid conditions that 
              exist within the nucleation region of large earthquakes.  This  experimental
              program will focus on the rate at which faults  strengthen with time, the
              physical and chemical processes that  cause fault healing and lithification in
              fault gouge, and the  rate/state friction constitutive properties under
              hydrothermal  conditions.  The experiments will be conducted at pressures, 
              temperatures and fluid conditions simulating the upper 10 to 15 km  of the
              earth's crust.  ***
