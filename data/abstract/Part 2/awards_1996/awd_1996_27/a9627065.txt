Abstract    :
              This research includes a quantitative X-ray resonant magnetic  scattering study
              of the magnetic phase behavior of the HoPr site-  random thin film alloy as
              function of concentration.  The study  entails:          o    chemical and
              magnetic structural characterization of HoPr            samples ranging in
              concentration of 20%Pr/80%Ho to            80%Pr/20%Ho to elucidate the RKKY
              indirect magnetic            exchange interaction in the rare earth elements.  
                    o    Studies of magnetic wavevector and the magnetic order           
              parameter of Ho and Pr atoms separately, by tuning the            incident
              energy at the Ho LIIIedge and Pr LIIedge.         o    Measurement of the
              induced moments on the Pr atoms.    The research also includes characterization
              of the interfaces in  the semiconductor system InAs/GaSb, by X-ray reflectivity
              and  anomalous scattering.  This artificially grown quantum  heterojunction,
              has received considerable research attention, due  to the potential application
              for optical and electronic       devices.    The interactive activities
              include: teaching two courses in project  WISE; collaborating with Prof. Emilio
              Mendez on semiconductor  research, and interacting with Prof. Richard Gambino
              on new  magnetic materials and Prof. Peter Stephens on synchrotron related 
              projects; acting as advisor and mentor to the female students in  physics; and
              presenting a formal graduate seminar in X-ray magnetic  scattering.
