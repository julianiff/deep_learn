Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and
              Technology will purchase computing equipment which will be dedicated to the
              support of research in the mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used
              for several projects, including in particular:       1. Algorithms on
              4-connected Halin Graphs and Reduced Halin Graphs.  2. A Branch and Cut
              Approach to Problems in Computational Logic.  3. Bayesian Estimation of Weibull
              Parameters.  4. Griffith Cracks Within a Finite Anisotropic Solid.  5.
              Semi-coarsening Multigrid Methods for Elliptic Partial Differential Equations.
