Abstract    :
                The goal of this research is to develop improved quantization and encoding 
              methods, with direct application to image and video coding. The three main 
              topics of study are i) exploiting interband dependence in subband coding,  ii)
              joint source/channel coding with applications to image and video  transmission
              over networks, and iii) lossy coding of motion vectors in  video coding.
              Advanced image and video coding methods will be developed to  quantize and
              encode across subbands, with the goal of providing granular  gain,
              classification gain, and entropy gain. Joint source/channel image and  video
              coding methods will be developed for wireless and packet-switched  network
              applications, with the goal of providing graceful image degradation  as the
              channel bit error rate or the network packet loss rate become large.  Methods
              will be developed for the lossy encoding of the motion compensation  vectors
              used in video coding, with the goal of determining a theory and  practical
              algorithms for the optimum joint lossy coding of the motion  compensation
              vectors and the prediction error.
