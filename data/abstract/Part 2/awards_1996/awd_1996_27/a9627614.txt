Abstract    :
                Moore  9627614      The Department of Mathematics at Tulane University will
              purchase a Silicon Graphics Power Challenge L Server with 324 MB RAM and 4GB
              Disk and the software packages Maple and Splus.  The equipment purchased with
              this grant will be used for several research projects, including in particular:
              adaptive methods for solving parabolic systems in three space dimensions
              possibly coupled with elliptic systems, computational biofluiddynamics, and
              simulation methods for computational statistics.        Professor Moore is
              developing an adaptive local refinement algorithm that utilizes variation in
              order and step-size in both space and time for parabolic systems in three
              dimensions.  Applications of the code include models in electrophysiology and
              phase transitions in the mantle.  Professor Fauci has developed a mathematical
              and a computational method to study the fluid dynamics of aquatic animal
              locomotion.  Professor Dinwoodie is studying the Metropolis algorithm for
              simulating discrete distributions.  Project participants also include one NSF
              postdoctoral associate, five graduate and one undergraduate students.
