Abstract    :
              Natural history collections of mollusk shells are subject to a form of
              degradation known as OByneOs DiseaseO if they are improperly housed.  ByneOs
              disease is a crystalline efflorescence on the surface of the shells that is
              formed by the reaction of acid vapors that are released by wood, cardboard, and
              paper storage materials with the calcium carbonate of the shells themselves. It
              is promoted by high and fluctuating temperature and humidity.  The Pacific
              mollusk collection of the Bishop Museum is the most comprehensive in the world,
              containing over 6,000,000 specimens. As such, it is a major resource for
              studies in biodiversity, conservation, and phylogeny.  However, the collection
              is suffering from ByneOs disease.  This award will provide the materials and
              staff to properly conserve the collection by carefully cleaning the
              efflorescence from the shells, transferring them into modern, acid-free trays,
              boxes and glass vials that will be stored within existing and new steel
              collections cases, and making new, computerized labels for the collections. 
              The outcome of the project will be a well curated, computer-catalogued and
              properly conserved collection that will be available for study and research
              well into the future.
