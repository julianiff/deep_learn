Abstract    :
                The project is a continuation of an on-going effort to develop a 
              comprehensive model of ionosphere - magnetosphere coupling.  The  emphasis in
              this phase of the project will be on coupling the  horizontal convective motion
              with field-aligned transport  processes.  An important aspect of the work is
              the inclusion of  both magnetospheric drivers (field-aligned currents, hot
              plasma,  field-aligned potential drops, and kinetic instabilities) and 
              ionospheric drivers (varying boundary conditions at low altitudes).   The
              overall goal is to elucidate the interplay between horizontal  convection and
              the microphysics associated with field-aligned  transport for different solar
              cycle, seasonal, and magnetic  activity conditions.
