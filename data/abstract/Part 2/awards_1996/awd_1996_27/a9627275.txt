Abstract    :
              CDA-9627275  Wegner, Peter  Brown University    Special Project: Research
              directions in computing      This grant provides partial support for an
              invitation-only workshop on "Research Directions in Computing", developed by
              the ACM as a part of its 50th- anniversary year celebration.  Goals of the
              workshop are to contribute to a better understanding of computing research and
              its role in support of larger economic and social issues.  The workshop will
              examine the current status and future directions of computing research, will
              involve approximately 100 participants, and will produce a set of working group
              reports.  Its findings will be made public through the working group reports,
              publications in major ACM journals, and at least one panel at ACM '97.  ***
