Abstract    :
              The Biometrics Unit at Cornell University will purchase a dual processor
              Sparcstation20, 4 Sparcstation5's and 5 Xterminals with supporting peripherals
              and software to equip a research computing facility to support research in the
              mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for several research
              projects, including in particular:  1. Semiparametric Longitudinal Data
              Analysis, by Naomi S. Altman  2. Implementing Accurate Approximations, by
              George Casella  3. Statistical Problems in Molecular Biology, by Gary A.
              Churchill  4. Estimation in Generalized Linear Mixed Models, by Charles E.
              McCulloch  5. Local Regression Methods, by David Ruppert.    All 5 projects
              require the use of a powerful computer and software for computational work,
              simulation and symbolic algebra.
