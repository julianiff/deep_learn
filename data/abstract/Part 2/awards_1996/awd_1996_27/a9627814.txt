Abstract    :
              9627814  Barnes   Magmatic intrusion is commonly assumed to play a role in
              continual extension but the casual relationships between extension and
              intrusion are poorly understood. This project aims to establish the
              relationship between intrusion and deformation in deep-seated exposures in a
              Cordilleran metamorphic core complex by study of a sequence of intrusion
              emplaced in the Northern Basin Range, Nevada, a highly extended area. In this
              setting, exposures in the Lamoille Canyon, Northern Ruby Mountains provides a
              combination of excellent exposure, abundant syn extensional intrusions and a
              significant base of geochronological and structural data. This work involves
              petrologic, geochemical and isotopic study of granites to track the temporal
              compositional variations and to use these data to estimate the evolution's of
              the mid-crustal magmas during and after extensional episodes. Results are
              expected to help establish the changing conditions of melt generations and
              emplacement during crustal stretching, and to help test the role that magmatism
              plays in deep crustal deformation.
