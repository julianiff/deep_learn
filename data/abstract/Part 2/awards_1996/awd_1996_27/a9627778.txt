Abstract    :
              9627778  Freericks/Liu    This grant supports a new program, consisting of two
              young  faculty members, one female (A. Liu) in condensed matter  physics at the
              Georgetown University.  The grant supports  work on a careful and detailed
              analysis of the electron-  phonon interaction based theory of superconductivity
              in the  regimes where Migdal's theorem is no longer valid.  This  work also
              takes advantage of new theoretical tools that have  been developed for many
              body problems in large dimensions  (or alternatively large coordination number
              for atoms).  The  work proposed here includes first principles calculation of 
              the spectral densities (SD), derivation of SD from the  experimental tunneling
              data using more accurate algorithm,  incorporate vertex corrections in the
              theory of  superconductivity and analyze the effects of lattice  anharmonicity.
               %%%  This grant is to support collaborative research of two young  faculty
              (one female) with complementary  interests and  expertise in the theory of
              superconductivity at Georgetown  University. A major difference between the
              conventional  superconductors and essentially all of the ones that have  been
              discovered recently (doped fullerenes, high Tc  materials) is that the
              theoretical framework, so successful  in elucidating superconductivity in
              conventional materials,  cannot be applied to the new materials.  This project
              is to  consider the associated difficulties and find solutions for  them.  ***
