Abstract    :
              9627911  VanderPluijm   Work in recent years, particularly in young orogens, and
              at high structural levels, has shown that extensional structures form during
              and especially immediately following contraction.  This project will follow
              indications that extension was similarly involved in the Grenville orogeny of
              the eastern seaboard.  The Carthage-Colton shear zone marks the easternmost
              boundary of the Grenville Metasedimentary belt and preserves evidence of  the
              late-stage extensional history.   Results will not only clarify Grenville
              history of the Adirondacks but are expected to offer insights into the nature
              of deep-crustal processes doing orogenic evolution.
