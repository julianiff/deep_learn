Abstract    :
              9627043  Anderson    The Cincinnati Museum of Natural History and Science
              (CMNHS) is producing a large format film on caves.  The film will be a
              multidisciplinary introduction to the little-understood world of caves and cave
              science.  Caves will introduce viewers to the alien beauty and wonder of caves
              and the scientists and explorers who study them.  It will explore the formation
              of caves and speleothems, the highly adapted life-forms found in caves and the
              varied use of caves by people, past and present.  A comprehensive educational
              package of ancillary materials will be available to schools and to the general
              audience.      The PI for the project will be Kit Anderson, Director of Film
              Projects for CMNHS.  The principal science content specialist will be
              Jacqueline Janine Belwood, a researcher in vertebrate zoology at CMNHS.  She
              will work closely with an advisory committee of eighteen experts in caves, in
              the various science disciplines relevant to the cave environment, and in large
              format films.  She also will have access to the expertise found among the staff
              of the CMNHS.  The film will be produced by MacGillivray Freeman Films, the
              company that produced the large format film, "To Fly".
