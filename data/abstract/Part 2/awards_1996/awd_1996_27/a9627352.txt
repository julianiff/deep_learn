Abstract    :
              9627352  Hennage  This proposal seeks support from NSF by the Optical Society of
               America for the "1996 Advances in Optical Imaging and Photon  Migration
              Topical Meeting," to be held March 18-20, 1996, in  Orlando, Florida.  The
              meeting focuses on progress in optical  imaging which depends crucially on
              progress in a number of  disciplines.  Moreover, various techniques need to be
              judged in the  light of competing methods and sharpened with the knowledge of 
              progress of allied methods.  For example, imaging with light and  with near
              infrared radiation may soon lead to important new  modalities for medical
              imaging and diagnosis of the brain or breast  diseases.  Several time resolved,
              frequency modulation, coherence,  speckle and inverse techniques are now being
              developed to  characterize the key properties of tissues that are associated
              with  variations in the absorption and scattering cross sections.  Use is  made
              of coherent backscattering, ballistic and early arriving  light, ultrafast
              pulse techniques and spatial filtering, spectral  dynamics, time-resolved
              holography, interference and coherence of  nonlinear optical phenomena, and
              phase modulation approaches.  The  funds requested from the NSF are to support
              travel to the  conference of outstanding graduate students, post doctoral
              fellows  and junior faculty.  This is the second conference in this series.  
              The first conference served as the touchstone for the progress of  the field. 
              It represented a clear statement of the state of the  art of the time and
              played an important role in defining the  challenges ahead.  ***
