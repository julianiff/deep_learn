Abstract    :
                BBN Planet requests support from NSF for new Internet connections.  This grant
              will be used to help three institutions get access to the Internet; Dean
              College in Franklin,  Massachusetts, Notre Dame College in Manchester, New
              Hampshire and the Museum of Fine Arts of Boston, Massachusetts.  BBN Planet, a
              midlevel network in Massachusetts, will provide operations management and
              information services and it provides access to the Internet, a collection of
              interoperable networks connecting most research and education organizations in
              the United States.    The three Massachusetts institutions need the Internet
              connections to be able to access information resources throughout the state,
              the nation and the world.  The connection will benefit the faculty, staff
              students of these institutions as well as the community in general.
