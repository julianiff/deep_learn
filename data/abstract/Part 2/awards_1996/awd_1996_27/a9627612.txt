Abstract    :
              9627612  Carlos Ordonez  This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)
              for the development of the first analytical and computational description of a
              nested well Penning-Malmberg plasma processing reactor. The new nested well
              configuration may allow confinement of overlapping ion and electron plasmas
              within inner and outer electric potential wells, which provides a means for the
              confined ion density to exceed the severe ion density limit which occurs within
              the traditional single well Penning-Malmberg trap.  When arranged in this novel
              nested well configuration therefore, Penning-Malmberg traps become potentially
              suitable for use as materials processing plasma reactors in microelectronics
              and other areas.  The potential advantages of this type of reactor over
              existing reactors are significant: improved control of the physical to chemical
              etching rates with near perfect control of the plasma ion flux to processed
              surface, cleaner plasmas, equilibrium flat plasma density profiles for near
              uniformity in processing and low power requirements even with improved plasma
              confinement control. The design of a proposed follow-on experiment for
              verifying the operation description is included, in addition to the detailed
              theoretical analysis which forms the main body of the work.  ***
