Abstract    :
              9627306  Combs    The California Museum of Science and Industry (CMSI) will
              develop  a new exhibit "Body in Balance: Developing Integrative Life Science 
              Exhibits."  This will be a 3000 sq. ft. component in the new 17,500  sq. ft.
              World of Life Exhibit Hall when the CMSI opens its new  facility in 1997 and
              becomes the California Science Center.  The  World of Life is organized around
              several key science concepts  which emphasize the commonalties among living
              things and their life  processes.  One of the major ideas to be communicated in
              this area  is homeostasis as it applies to human beings.  Homeostasis has been 
              chosen because it is the unifying theme of system physiology.  The  exhibit
              will include seventeen exhibits (with a total of sixty-  seven interactive
              elements) as well as a "The Body in Balance"  theater presentations and
              bilingual (English/Spanish) exhibition  books.  This integrative view of body
              functions is consistent with  recommendations from Benchmarks for Science
              Literacy and the  Science Framework for California Public Schools Grades K-12. 
              A  broad menu of complementary formal education materials will be  developed.
