Abstract    :
              Abstract  EEC-96-27936, National Technological University, Lionel V. Baldwin,
              Principal Investigator    This award provides funding to the National
              Technological University for support of the 1996 National Engineers Week
              Teleconference for Middle and High School Students.  This seventh annual
              Discover Engineering teleconference will be delivered nationwide during
              National Engineers Week, on Feb. 21, 1996.  The purpose of this teleconference
              is two-fold.  First, the program provides U.S. middle and high school students
              and their teachers with an interesting insight into the work and career
              opportunities of engineers in a novel teleconference setting.  Secondly, the
              Discover Engineering telecast serves as the centerpiece of open houses at many
              industrial, government and college locations.  The telecast series is central
              to many local activities wherein engineers welcome students and teachers to the
              workplace, providing tours and wraparound discussion which are stimulated by
              the telecast.
