Abstract    :
              9627773  Lopez-Garriga  The goal of this project is to investigate the molecular
              basis for oxidation-reduction and ligand selection process of hemoglobin, (Hb1)
              isolated from Lucina pectinata.  This hemoglobin, produced by a symbiotic
              interaction between the clam and a bacteria, transports H2S to the bacteria and
              binds O2.  Dr. Lopez-Garriga will examine how reduction/oxidation of the metal
              center affects the porphyrin ring, and the ligand interaction with nearby amino
              acids.  Regarding this, the ligand binding properties of Hb 1 may be influenced
              by the low distal pocket polarity resulting from the array of phenylalanyl
              residues surrounding the heme.  Studies on monomeric hemoglobins, such as Hb 1,
              with extreme hydrophobic heme pocket environments can provide useful models for
              heme proteins to answer questions such as: How does ligand selection occur? 
              Which ligand-protein conformational and structural changes are important?  What
              controls ligand reactivity in these proteins?  How do the heme pocket aromatic
              residues contribute or modulate the association and dissociation ligand rate
              constants?   To answer these questions, Resonance Raman, FTIR, Time-Resolved
              Infrared Spectroscopy and Vibrational Analysis studies of Hb1 and ligand
              complexes (i.e. H2S, O2 and CO) are planned in order to probe the relation
              between the active site structure, oxidation-reduction reactions, Hb1
              conformation, and the function of the protein.  %%%
