Abstract    :
              9627800  Spera      The PIs propose to use fluid dynamical modeling techniques
              to study  the role of viscous heating in magmatic systems and will study  these
              effects in the generation of melts in mantle plumes and in  the formation and
              ascent of granitic diapirs.  They hypothesize  that viscous dissipation will
              prove important for understanding  both processes.  ***
