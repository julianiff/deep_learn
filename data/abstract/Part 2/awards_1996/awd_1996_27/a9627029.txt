Abstract    :
              9627029  Goudy    Five small science museums will form "TEAMS (Traveling
              Exhibits at  Museums of Science) Collaborative".  The partners include the 
              Montshire Museum of Science, Norwich, VT; The Catawba Science  Center, Hickory,
              NC; Sciencenter, Ithaca, NY; Discovery Center  Museum, Rockford, IL; and the
              Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum, Ann Arbor,  MI.  Each museum partner will develop a
              1500 sq. ft. (140 m2)  traveling exhibit that will include ten to fifteen
              interactive  units and supporting graphics and will circulate to all members of
               the partnership.  The exhibition topics are: AirPlay (Montshire  Museum of
              Science, Dirt (Catawba Science Center), You Can Count On  It (Sciencenter),
              Amusement Park Science (Discovery Center Museum),  and Eureka Labs: Science
              from Head to Toe (Ann Arbor Hands-On  Museum).  Following the circulation among
              the consortium members,  it is anticipated that the exhibits will circulate
              more broadly via  the Association of Science-Technology Centers Traveling
              Exhibit's  Program.  In addition to developing these exhibits, the 
              collaboration has an additional goals 1) focusing on the family  audiences by
              working together to enhance the family science  learning through the
              development of resources that can be used by  families that are related to
              exhibition topics, 2) building  institutional expertise in exhibit design,
              family programming, and  evaluation; and 3) conducting research on family
              learning and  sharing results with the field.  Complementary materials and 
              activities for teachers will also be developed for each exhibit.
