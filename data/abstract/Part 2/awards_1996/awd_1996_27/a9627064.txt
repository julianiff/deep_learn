Abstract    :
              9627064  Hirshon    The American Association for Advancement of Science (AAAS)
              will produce and test a pilot series of twelve 90-second features on science. 
              Aimed at the 12- to 18-year old market, the features are designed to be
              broadcast daily on commercial stations with formats aimed at this age level. 
              Each feature will take one of three forms:  News Features based on current
              research, answers to Audience Questions about science, or Skits and Songs that
              convey basic science concepts.  The AAAS also will begin securing carriage for
              the pilot programs and a potential longer series of programs.    The PI will be
              Robert Hirshon who is currently the Project Director and Executive Producer for
              Kinetic City Super Crew.  Justin Warner, who has been producer/writer for the
              AAAS radio features Science Update and Why Is It?, will be the Producer/Head
              Writer.  The content director will be David Lindley, formerly Senior Editor for
              Science.
