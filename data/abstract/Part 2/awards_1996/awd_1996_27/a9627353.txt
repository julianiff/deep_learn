Abstract    :
              Abstract    The Polar Libraries Colloquy (Colloquy) was founded in 1971 to
              provide an international forum for librarians and others involved in the
              collection, preservation, and dissemination of polar information.  Colloquy
              participants represent the institutions generating and housing most of the
              unpublished and published information about the Arctic and Antarctic. 
              Colloquy's purpose is to bring these specialists together to discuss issues of
              mutual interest and to promote improved and expanded collections, coordinated
              information systems, improved delivery of information and materials, and other
              services.    NSF funding supports production of the 1996 Colloquy proceedings
              which will include the text of presented papers, poster sessions, a summary of
              the business meeting, and a list of participants.  The published proceedings
              provide an invaluable and unique reference and reach a broader audience than
              does Colloquy itself.  They foster collaborative projects, report on the status
              of polar information preservation and dissemination, and aid in identifying
              information gaps.  The proceedings are important as the most comprehensive
              record available concerning polar information management.
