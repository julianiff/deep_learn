Abstract    :
              9627795  Sloan  The purpose of this study is to investigate the issue of 
              continentality (i.e., temperatures associated with large land  masses), from
              the perspective of possible model sources for  discrepancies between model
              results and proxy data interpretations  of Eocene continental temperatures. 
              The issue of continental  interior climate characteristics persists as one of
              the major  questions and most active debates of paleoclimatology.  Inclusion 
              of the correct zonal temperature profile, along with the annual  cycle in model
              calculations, may result in large winter freeze line  displacements, and
              associated changes in other temperature  parameters.  This work will focus on
              (i) the position and locations  of the model-predicted freeze line throughout
              the year (including  isotherms for +2, 0, -2 and -5 degrees C, corresponding to
              various  biologic tolerance limits), (ii) the annual amplitude of  temperature
              change over the continents, (iii) the summer maximum  temperature values in
              continental interior regions.
