Abstract    :
              9627196  LaBar    Explorations is an 8,200 sq. ft. permanent exhibition
              containing  about 70 educational components that will stimulate interest in and
               understanding of the ways that science and technology are extending  the
              ability to examine and understand the Earth, its oceans and the  universe.  The
              exhibit design gives equal priority to science  content and learning via
              high-tech device components, interweaving  experiences to help the public
              understand cutting edge  technologies, the scientific principles behind them,
              and how  technology is used to advance scientific knowledge.  To ensure 
              accessibility to the Hispanic community, graphics and multimedia  programs will
              be presented in English and Spanish.  Strategies for  addressing the language
              needs of other non-English speaking  visitors are employed.  It is expected
              that the engineering designs  and solutions developed for these exhibits will
              advance the  informal science learning profession buy contributing
              significantly  to one of the top challenges faced by science museum exhibit 
              designers today - the interpretation of advanced technological  tools and
              capabilities to a broad museum public with diverse  technical literacy skills.
