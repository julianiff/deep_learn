Abstract    :
              9627222  Hughes  This study will characterize the nature of chemical
              substitutions by precise diffraction data. The project involves three tasks:
              incorporation of REE in titanite, high-precision single crystal and Rietveld
              studies of LaNi5-ySny hydrides, and REE in naturally-occurring perovskite
              phases. Of particular interest in titanite is the accommodation of REE's and
              the concomitant charge-balancing substitution for the Ca+2 ( REE+3 exchange.
              Intermetallic compounds such as LaNi5 doped with varying amounts of Sn, are
              under intense multi-disciplinary investigation for use as hybrid hosts for H
              fuels and electrodes in high-performance batteries. High-precision crystal
              structure studies investigate the disorder in the phase as SN substitutes for
              Ni. Rietveld analysis of the atomic arrangements will be undertaken to overcome
              the pervasive twinning in perovskites that mitigates against
              solution/refinement by single crystal methods.
