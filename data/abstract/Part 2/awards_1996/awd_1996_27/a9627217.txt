Abstract    :
                9627217  Zahniser       This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project will construct and demonstrate an instrument for the detection of
              nitrogen dioxide (NO2), one of the most important components of nitrogen oxide
              species (NOy) in the troposphere. Direct measurements of NO2 are crucial for
              understanding the chemical processes that determine natural levels of
              tropospheric ozone and for assessing potential effects of human-influenced
              emissions. The difficulties associated with direct measurements of NO2 in the
              unpolluted troposphere arise from low (< 100 pptv) concentrations and the
              potential for interferences from other more abundant nitrogen compounds. This
              proposal would demonstrate a direct spectroscopic method using infrared
              absorption with a tunable diode laser light source which would directly detect
              absolute levels of NO2 in the clean troposphere. A key component of the
              proposed research plan is the construction of a long path length, low volume
              absorption cell which would have sufficient length (~500 m) to provide adequate
              sensitivity and yet have a minimal volume (< 10 liters) to enable rapid
              sampling and a minimal instrument response time. Modulation of the trace
              species at the cell inlet using a pulsed W laser will allow real-time
              background subtraction to further increase the sensitivity. Automated signal
              processing using curve fitting to known spectral line parameters will provide
              absolute concentration levels without using calibration gases. The resulting
              instrument will have an NO2 detection limit of 4 ppt with a signal averaging
              time of 100 s.   The instrumentation resulting from this program will be useful
              for   researchers in atmospheric chemistry for measuring concentrations of 
              other trace gases in addition to NO2.  The long path absorption cell  would be
              marketable separately for incorporation into laser absorption  systems for
              monitoring industrial pollutants, toxic wastes, and  combustion emissions.  ***
