Abstract    :
              This research involves investigating the major processes occurring  in the Io
              plasma torus - the sources and losses of material; the  mechanisms of energy
              transfer from Jupiter to the plasma and  between the plasma species and
              radiation fields; and the response  of the torus to changes in the volcanic
              output to Io.    By building on previous models of the torus structure, Dr.
              Bagenal  will combine in situ particles and fields measurements obtained on 
              the initial passage of the Galileo spacecraft through the torus  with remote
              sensing measurements obtained on subsequent orbits to  determine the
              3-dimensional distributions of plasma properties   (density, temperature,
              composition) and their variations with time.   By building on these models of
              the torus chemistry, she will:   model the production of plasma from Iogenic
              neutral material  following the plasma as it diffuses radially; calculate
              sources and  losses of each species through ionization and charge-exchange 
              processes; and compute energy pick-up, transfer and radiation  losses.     
              Interactive activities include running the Space Physics Seminars,  teaching a
              graduate special research topics course, working with  the UCLA Committee on
              Gender Issues, and running a seminar/workshop  on gender issues.
