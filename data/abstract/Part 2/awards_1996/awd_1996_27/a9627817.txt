Abstract    :
              Sikor, Thomas  U. of California, Berkeley   Vietnam's economic reforms have
              produced effects on land use practices that differ by the ecological conditions
              under which they occur.  Villages located in more heterogeneous landscapes show
              a tendency toward more varied land use patterns than those which exist on flat
              land where wet rice agriculture is dominant.  The research will investigate how
              village land endowments shape local responses to reform, as evidenced by
              changing peasant land use practices.  It is hypothesized that the dynamics of
              land use are impacted by changes in local level tenure and credit institutions.
               The research will be carried out through data collection and the comparative
              study of four villages in Northern Viet Nam.  It will provide an empirical and
              theoretical understanding of the ways in which natural conditions are impacted
              by national policy and in turn also shape local responses to national policy.
