Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this research is to investigate the effect  of the in
              vitro culture environment on the cultivation of cell-  polymer constructs in
              bioreactors.  Seeding mammalian cells onto  biodegradable polymer scaffolds and
              growing tissues on these  scaffolds in bioreactors represents a novel approach
              to tissue  regeneration.  Studies have shown that tissue growth and function 
              is affected by environmental forces.  In these studies, cell-  polymer
              constructs are cultivated in three bioreactors with  distinctly different fluid
              dynamic environments.  Measurements are  made using laser doppler and
              ultrasound doppler techniques to  characterize the fluid dynamic environment in
              each reactor.  These  measurements are correlated with structural and
              functional tissue  properties.  Results from these studies will increase our
              basic  understanding of tissue growth and function under various  hydrodynamic
              conditions and contribute to the optimization of  bioreactor systems for
              cultivation of clinically useful tissues.    The interactive activities include
              developing and teaching an  interactive tissue engineering course, coordinating
              a "Brown Bag  Lunch" Series for women and minority faculty and students, 
              coordinating an outreach program for K-12 students, and  participating as a
              Faculty Role Model/Mentor in student activities  administered by the New
              England Board of Higher Education.
