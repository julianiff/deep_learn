Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program supports research on mechanisms of organometallic reactions by   Dr.
              Charles P. Casey of the Chemistry Department, University of Wisconsin   at
              Madison.  Three distinct areas of research will be pursued:    investigations
              of d-0 yttrium and zirconium olefin complexes; development   of pi-propargyl
              metal complexes; and the chemistry of rhenium carbene   complexes.  The systems
              chosen for the first area of investigation will   permit measurement of the
              rate of alkene dissociation and the rate of   inversion at the metal center. 
              This information is important for   understanding the stereochemistry of
              polymerization with chiral   metallocene catalysts.  Three methods of synthesis
              of the pi-propargyl   complexes will be investigated, as well as the reaction
              of nucleophiles   with these complexes, which have been shown to be  useful in
              organic   synthesis.  The stereochemistry of addition of HCl to rhenium carbene
                complexes will be studied, along with the formation of some unusual  
              complexes designed to give information about modes of association of   metals
              with double-bonded carbon compounds and about using variation in   ring strain
              to favor formation of desired products.  Organometallic chemistry has proved to
              be very useful in homogeneous   catalysis and in developing new methods and
              reagents for synthesis of   organic compounds.   The reactions chosen for
              investigation are relevant   to the behavior of commercially important
              processes.
