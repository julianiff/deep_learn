Abstract    :
                          96-27859  Hager    Abstract    The PI proposes to use his newly
              developed modeling method to understand the postglacial  rebound problem and
              its implications for sea level change.  This modeling effort will use  both
              forward and inverse techniques and will determine the possible trade-offs among
               acceptable ice models and acceptable mantle viscosity models and will
              determine the  resulting range of changes in relative sea level due to
              Pleistocene deglaciation.  These  models will include ice history and mantle
              viscosity structure in their parameterization, and  will be constrained and
              tested using physical observations including VLBI (Very Long  Baseline
              Interferometry), GPS (Global Positioning System), and traditional geological
              data.  ***
