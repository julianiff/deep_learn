Abstract    :
                  967265  Euler  This research project is concerned with the development of
              new  thin film strain gages.  Three approaches will be used.  The  first
              employs wide band gap semiconductors as the active sensing  element in a strain
              gage where both resistivity and absorption  spectroscopy can be used to monitor
              the strain.  These materials  are attractive because they have good
              reproductivity, long term  environmental and sensor stability, and large gage
              factors.  The  second approach will use polymers as the sensing element.  The 
              optical response of these materials is also sensitive to strain  with the
              potential to lead to inexpensive, commodity level active  strain elements. 
              Finally, new polymers will be developed that  store the integrated strain over
              time and can be used to measure  accumulated damage to the substrate.  The
              development of this  aspect of the research relies on the ability to monitor
              the  strain response conveniently such as during earthquake, wind, or  vehicle
              induced structural vibrations using the optical  methodology developed in the
              initial stages of the project.  A  successful outcome to the research will lead
              to cheaper strain  gages that, because of the thin film nature, can be applied
              to  buildings and infrastructure materials to monitor the strain and  to assess
              the damage during a catastrophic event such as an  earthquake.  ***
