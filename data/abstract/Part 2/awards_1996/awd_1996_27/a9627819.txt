Abstract    :
                This project studies the computational complexity of  communication problems
              and quantum computing.  Topics  explored include: (1) complexity theories for
              (a) multiparty  communications, (b) probabilistic communications, (c)  quantum
              communications, and (d) quantum circuits; and (2)  complexity questions for
              algebraic decision trees.   The  mathematical techniques employed are drawn
              from such areas  as: (I) combinatorics; (ii) probability theory; and (iii) 
              topology.  ***
