Abstract    :
              9627782  Zuckerman    The proposed research lies in the general area of
              mathematical physics. Previously, the investigator worked on two-dimensional
              quantum field theory, clarifying various aspects of the algebraic structure in
              quantum cohomology theory. The investigator plans to further pursue this,
              incorporating also the more geometric aspects such as mirror manifolds and
              Calabi-Yau theory. Another subproject deals with four-dimensional
              generalizations of quantum field theory using double loop cocycles. Finally,
              the investigator intends to consider possible links between conformal field
              theories and ideal hydrodynamics via the geometry of diffeomorphism groups.   
              Quantum field theory arises in the context of attempting to give a unified
              formulation of basic forces of nature. Two-dimensional 'conformal' formulation
              of this theory is relatively well-understood, at least from a purely
              mathematical standpoint, and the present proposal seeks to further study the
              two-dimensional model with a view towards applying string theory to the
              phenomenology of elementary particles.
