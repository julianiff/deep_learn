Abstract    :
              The second international workshop on computational  differentiation will be held
              on February 12-15, l996 in Santa Fe,  New Mexico.  It is being conducted by
              SIAM with the cooperation  of the special interest group on numerical computing
              (SIGNUM) of  the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM).  The workshop is 
              intended to bring together researchers and students working on  constructive
              and accurate methods for differentiation and their  applications.    The
              workshop attendees will discuss recent advances in theory,  implementation, and
              application of computational differentiation.  The resulting close interaction
              between developers of tools and  their users in applied mathematics,
              computation, science, and  engineering will accelerate progress.  The
              researchers and  developers will be able to focus their efforts on the major 
              issues and users will have a view of what is currently being  developed.  ***
