Abstract    :
              9627299  Goldberg    This award will support a planning visit by Dr. Stephen R. 
              Goldberg of Whittier College to go to Mexico City to work  with Dr. Guillermo
              Salgado Maldonado at the Instituto de  Biologia at the Universidad Nacional
              Automona de Mexico.  They will meet to plan a research project involving a 
              helminthological survey of amphibians and reptiles of  Mexico.  This fauna is
              one of the largest and diverse in the  world.  During their visit, they will
              focus on what  particular group should be examined.  Should it be a  specific
              species, or group, or a single species from a range  of habitats?        Dr. G.
              Salgado Maldonado and his students will collect the  reptiles and amphibians,
              dissect them and collect parasites.  Dr. Goldberg and his Whittier colleague,
              Dr. Charles R.  Bursey will identify these parasites back in the U.S.  Dr. 
              Goldberg will also examine amphibians and reptiles already  collected and
              stored in museums in Mexico.  There is  literature in Mexico that is not
              available in the U.S.  Most  of the data already published in this area has
              involved  western North America.  This project will allow the research  to
              extend southward into Mexico.    ***
