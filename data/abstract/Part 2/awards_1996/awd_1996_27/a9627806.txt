Abstract    :
              9627806  Barazangi   The collision between Africa and Europe in the Western
              Mediterranean region resulted in a complex plate boundary with a broad zone of
              deformation. Mesozoic rift structures have been reactivated by the current
              tectonism, which itself occupies the foreland position of the collisional zone
              extending from Morocco to Tunisia. There are several examples of such
              intraplate mountain ranges but this one is tectonically active, and thus offers
              an opportunity to investigate active deformation mechanisms in this
              environment. The work involves kinematic analysis of microtectonic data and
              earthquake focal mechanisms. This project is a joint research effort with
              Moroccan institutions, principally the Geological survey of Morocco. Results
              are expected to be applicable to similar tectonics problems elsewhere.
