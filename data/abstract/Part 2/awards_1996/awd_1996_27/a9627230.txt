Abstract    :
              9627230  King      The PI proposes to utilize newly developed formulations for
              viscous  faulting, non-Newtonian rheology, and phase transitions to focus on 
              the deformation and thermal structure of subduction zones from  dynamically
              self-consistent convection models.  The proposed models  will focus on
              questions at intermediate length scales, and will  result in a set of thermal
              models of subduction zones with more  physically realistic temperature
              profiles.  The models will be used  to ray-trace through and calculate seismic
              residual sphere anomaly  patterns and starting models for slab tomograpy, and
              will also be  used to develop more realistic geotherms in subduction zones.
