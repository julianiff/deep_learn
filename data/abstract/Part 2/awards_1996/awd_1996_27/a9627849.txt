Abstract    :
              9627849 Shu   This project is a continuation of the research supported by NSF
              Grant ECS-9214488.  The object is to study the modeling, mathematical analysis,
              and in particular numerical approximations using recently developed, accurate
              and stable finite difference and finite element algorithms, for semiconductor
              device simulations.  The emphasis is on simulating the hydrodynamic (HD)
              models, the energy transport (ET), and the quantum hydrodynamic (QHD) models,
              and investigating their physical implications.  Special attention will be paid
              to time dependent problems, such as the multi-valley Gunn oscillator, which
              require robust algorithms with high order accuracy both in space and in time. 
              Collaborations with device physicists, device engineers, and applied
              mathematicians will be maintained, to investigate device simulation problems
              form both physical, mathematical, and numerical points of view. ***
