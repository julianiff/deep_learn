Abstract    :
              9627045 de Acosta  The investigator proposes to contribute to the study of basic
               questions in Large Deviations related to some important  stochastic sequences
              or ppocesses.  This includes the development  of suitable abstract mathematical
              tools, the identification of  models which lead naturally to interesting large
              deviation  questions, and the computation of the analytical expression of 
              specific rate functions.  The scope of the project includes the  following
              situations:  (i) trajectories of Markov processes (ii)  trajectories of certain
              classes of semimartingales (iii)  empirical measures under various dependence
              conditions.  A  fundamental theme in Probability Theory and its applications is
               the study of situations in which a sequence of averages  constructed from a
              stochastic sequence converges in some sense to  a deterministic limit.  Large
              Deviation theory deals with the  problem of estimating the small probabilities
              that the averages  will deviate from the "typical behavior" represented by the 
              limit.  Here are two situations to which the proposed research  has direct or
              potential relevance; (a) Probabilistic models are  increasingly used in
              analyzing the performance of complex  communication systems and computer
              networks. Large Deviation  theory (in particular, large deviations of certain
              Markov  processes) is a powerful tool in the analysis of rare events  (that is,
              deviations from "normal behavior") in large systems of  those types. (b) Large
              Deviation theory is very useful in the  analysis of rare events associated to
              thermodynamic limits in  several important models in Statistical Mechanics.
