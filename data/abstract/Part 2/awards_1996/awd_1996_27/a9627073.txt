Abstract    :
              The carers of nonacademic scientists and engineers remain poorly  understood,
              especially why few women have technical careers in  industry.  Guided by
              multidisciplinary theories about careers, this  project compares technical
              careers to other white collar careers  and examines how gender influences
              careers.    The research design is a case study of General Motors' engineers 
              and scientists, including those in its high-tech electronics  division.  A
              longitudinal database is used to examine job  sequences, including promotions,
              quits and lateral moves.    The research contributes to public policy debate
              about a  recommendation that graduate programs produce more versatile 
              scientists and engineers.  A 1994-5 survey of all GM employees is  used to
              examine the link between graduate education and diverse job  experiences.   
              Interactive activities include teaching two innovative course on  applying
              demography to business and government issues, speaking in  a campus-wide series
              about Women Leading Technology, and mentoring  and counseling students,
              especially about nonacademic careers.
