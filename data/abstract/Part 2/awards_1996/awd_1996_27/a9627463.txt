Abstract    :
              9627463  Hart  Organism-flow interactions are potentially important in a wide
              variety of ecological settings.  Unfortunately, it is often difficult to
              quantify the complex flow fields in which organisms actually live, thereby
              limiting our understanding of the direct and indirect effects of flow on
              various ecological processes and patterns.  This collaborative research, which
              combines expertise in aquatic ecology and mechanical engineering (simulation
              and measurement of flow and transport processes), will apply recent
              methodological advances in engineering to describe the flow environments
              inhabited by stream benthic animals.  Specifically, the research will use
              computational fluid dynamic models t o simulate benthic flow fields, and will
              validate the predictions using recently developed acoustic Doppler velocimeters
              as well as hot-film anemometers.  These validated models can provide detailed
              descriptions of spatial and temporal variations in flow field characteristics. 
              The effects of different flow fields on pattern of feeding, habitat selection,
              and distribution of suspension-feeding stream insects will then be examined via
              experimental studies in laboratory flumes and in the field.  How such
              organism-flow relationships vary with spatial scale will also be examined.   
              This 'Small Grant for Exploratory Research' will demonstrate the value of this
              interdisciplinary approach for ecological studies in streams and rivers.  It
              can ultimately lead to major advances in the study of organism-flow
              interactions in a wide variety of ecological systems.
