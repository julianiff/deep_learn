Abstract    :
              9627890  Arritt   The goal of this project is to understand and estimate
              quantitatively the linkage between large-scale atmospheric circulation
              anomalies and the atmospheric component of the regional hydrological cycle
              associated with Midwestern summertime floods and droughts.  Between 1979 and
              the present, there were four major flood and three major drought years.  For
              those year, the principal investigators will carry out (1) diagnostic analyses
              of global circulation patterns in National Centers for Environmental Prediction
              (NCEP) global reanalyses, supplemented by rain-gauge precipitation data for the
              midwestern region and (2) simulations with NCAR's MM5 regional model, run in
              climate mode and driven by large-scale forcing from the NCEP analyses, focused
              on exploring regional water vapor fluxes and the mechanisms relating them to
              the large-scale forcing.  Special attention will be given to the role of the
              southerly low-level jet in defining the water vapor transport and flux
              divergence.  For one of the years of interest, an important additional source
              of high resolution data will come from specially processed wind profiler data. 
                 These studies are critical to understanding the hydrological cycle and will
              contribute to the goals of the Global Energy and Water Experiment (GEWEX) of
              the World Climate Research Program.  This project is supported under NSF's
              Water and Energy:  Atmospheric, Vegetative, and Earth Interactions (WEAVE)
              Initiative of the Global Change Research Program.  ***
