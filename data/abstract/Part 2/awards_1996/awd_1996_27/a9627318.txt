              Title: Developing an Absolutely-Dated Holocene Tree-Ring Chronology  from
              Subfossil Huon Pine in Tasmania for Paleoclimatic and Isotopic  Studies    This
              award supports research within the Earth System History  Program (USGCRP) to
              develop a Holocene-length, absolutely-dated  annual tree-ring chronology from
              Huon pine wood in Tasmania.  This  chronology will be used to provide
              dendrochronologically-dated wood  for developing an independent radiocarbon
              calibration for the  Southern Hemisphere.  This will be used to compare for
              comparing  with and extend the calibration curve developed from Northern 
              Hemisphere wood alone.  The wood will also be used to characterize  the
              inter-hemispheric offset in atmospheric radiocarbon throughout  the Holocene. 
              In so doing, periods of unusual thermohaline  circulation and ocean ventilation
              may identified.  This project  will also provide dated wood for stable isotope
              studies and develop  multi-millennial annual tree-ring chronologies for
              dendroclimatic  studies.  Thus, these data will provide high-resolution,
              precisely-  dated estimates of climate variability for most of the Holocene in 
              this sector of the Southern Hemisphere.  This will be the longest  tree-ring
              chronology in the world and will provide a wealth of  information about
              high-resolution climate and radiocarbon  variations back to the late-glacial
              period.
