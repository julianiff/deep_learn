Abstract    :
              9627085  Mattei    The Louisville Science Center will develop "The World We
              Create",  a 13,000 sq. ft. exhibit which will transform their second floor to 
              an active learning environment where visitors can explore the  simplest element
              of the creative process to the most sophisticated  networks available to our
              society.  The activities will be  organized into five core exhibit areas: New
              Way Tunnel, Think Tank,  Inventor's Garage, Chemistry Kitchen, and Tech World
              and will  reinforce educational reform activities in math, science, problem- 
              solving, team cooperation, and decision making.  In addition to the  large
              number of interactives, there is a substantial  technology/telecommunications
              component known as the Tech Forum.   This will serve at the home site for the
              Kentucky TeleLinking  Network (KTLN).  The educational objectives of the
              exhibit were  developed under the guidance of prominent formal educators in the
               state and they address both the education reform goals of the state  and
              national science and math standards.  The exhibit has also been  developed with
              direct participation of a number of private sector  partners.  It is an
              impressive community effort.  The exhibit is  scheduled to open in March, 1997.
