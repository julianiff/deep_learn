Abstract    :
                            Spilhaus  9627219   The objective of this project is to make
              possible the participation of approximately 7 researchers, from the United
              States in the International Geological Congress (IGC).  The 30th IGC will take
              place August 4-14, 1996 in Beijing, China.  This venue will highlight the
              demands of massive populations and evolving economies on the resources of the
              earth and the environment.  It will also offer unparalleled opportunities for
              U.S. scientists to learn about the unique geology of China and the progress
              made by Chinese geoscientists.  The scientific contacts and new perspectives
              that U.S. scientists will find at the technical sessions and field trips of the
              Congress will be invaluable for advancing understanding of the dynamic earth
              system.
