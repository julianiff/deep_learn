Abstract    :
              ***  9627270  Grahn    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              takes a crucial step towards making manufacturing more flexible by reducing or
              eliminating the need for specialized end-effectors in many applications.  This
              will be achieved by endowing general-purpose end-effectors with triaxial force
              sensing arrays.  Information from these arrays.  Information from these arrays
              can be used to facilitate object grasping, manipulation, and slip detection and
              correction, as well as increasing productivity and product quality through the
              monitoring and feedback controlling of these forces during the robot task
              cycle.    Phase I established the feasibility of the proposed triaxial force
              sensing concept and  sensor construction was greatly simplified along with
              making the se nsor more robust and more economical to fabricate.  In Phase II
              of this project, a small, high-density prototype triaxial force sensor array
              will be designed and fabricated for use on robot end-effectors.  Rubbers for
              use in the sensor's pad will be extensively evaluated.  Support electronics for
              the force sensor array will be designed, fabricated, and integrated into an
              existing electronics uni-axial tactile sensor system.  System software will be
              developed for operating the sensor and displaying the normal and shear force
              data.  Once the triaxial force sensor system is fully operational, its
              performance will be evaluated.    Arrays will find use in flexible
              manufacturing, industrial automation, telerobotics, tire tread testing, foot
              force distribution, gait analysis, development of handles on sporting goods,
              industrial tools, and surgical tools.  Single-element sensors will be used in
              computer cursor control, as accelerometers, and triazial forceplates.  ***
