Abstract    :
              9627479  Sack  This project is composed experimental studies, theoretical
              studies and petrologic applications of sulfosalts/sulfides in the system
              Ag2S-Cu2S-ZnS-FeS-As2S3-Sb2S3-S and Bi-, Mn-, Cd-, and Hg- substituted
              supersystems. The experimental studies will characterize the net transport
              equilibria of low variance assemblages critical for developing an internally
              consistent thermodynamic database, and exchange and net transport equilibria
              critical for extending the database for Ag2S-Cu2S-ZnS-FeS-As2S3-Sb2S3-S
              sulfosalts/sulfides to Mn-, Hg-, Cd-, and Bi-bearing supersystems. Theoretical
              studies will: (1) obtain an accurate model for the Gibbs energy of (Zn,Fe)S
              sphalerites with explicit provisions for strong short-range order on its
              metallic sublattice utilizing a variation of Kikuchi's cluster variation
              techniques, (2) an internally consistent thermodynamic database for
              Ag2S-Cu2S-ZnS-FeS-As2S3-Sb2S3-S sulfosalts/sulfides from analysis of published
              calorimetric, crystallographic, and phase equilibrium studies, thermochemical
              models previously developed by the PI, results of activity and of net transport
              experiments, (3) thermodynamic mixing properties of Mn-, Cd-, and Hg-bearing
              tetrahedrite-tennantites and sphalerites, and (4) non-idealities,
              activity-composition relations, and standard state properties associated with
              the Bi-Sb substitutions in stibnite-bismuthinite  (Sb,Bi)2S3  solutions and
              coexisting sulfosalts Ag(Sb,Bi)S2 myargyrite-matildites, Cu(Sb,Bi)S2
              chalcostibite-emplectites, and Pb(Sb,Bi)2S4 zinkenite-bonchevites. The
              petrologic applications include the recalibration of sphalerite cosmobarometer
              to obtain formation pressures, masses and dimensions of asteroids parental to
              IAB, IIIAB and IIICD iron meteorites and for application to  terrestrial
              sulfide deposits, and application of composite thermochemical database to
              develop ore deposition models for zoned polymetallic base metal deposits
              involving multicomponent sulfosalts in southern India and Peru.
