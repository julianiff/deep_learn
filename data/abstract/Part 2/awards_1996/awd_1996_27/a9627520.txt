Abstract    :
              This action funds a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral  Research
              Fellowship in Biosciences Related to the  Environment for 1996.    The
              fellowship supports research and training in the area of  prokaryotic genetics.
               The title of the research and  training plan is "Identification of genes
              involved in  environmental and physiological stress resistance of  Pseudomonas
              fluorescens."    Soil bacteria grown to stationary phase in culture are more 
              tolerant to environmental and physiological stresses than  are
              exponentially-growing cells.  Sigma factor serves as a  central regulator of
              stationary-phase gene expression in E.  coli.  This study focuses on
              Pseudomonas fluorescens in  which a gene coding for sigma has recently been
              cloned.  Genes preferentially expressed by P. fluorescens in  stationary phase
              will be identified.  These studies will  expand the current knowledge of
              genetic factors involved in  bacterial stress response and contribute to our 
              understanding of the molecular basis of interactions between  a soil bacterium
              and its physical environment.
