Abstract    :
              The long term goal of this research is to use thio derivatives of  RNA bases and
              phosphate diesters to explore or to exploit metal ion  binding on nucleic
              acids.  The first project uses a single  phosphorothioate modification to
              direct a metal ion cross-linking  agent to a Tetrahymena ribozyme for the
              purpose of studying  ribozyme structure and selective inactivation of RNA.  The
              second  project examines metal ion binding to 4-thiouridine and 6- 
              thioguanosine and incorporate a 4-thiouridine into a Hammerhead  ribozyme in
              positions thought to be important in metal ion binding.   Metal-ion-RNA
              interactions are a key component of RNA structure and  are important in the
              development of therapeutic agents for the  inactivation of RNA.    Interactive
              activities in the classroom and in the research  laboratory involve both
              undergraduate and graduate female chemistry  students.  A graduate level
              interdisciplinary course in  bioinorganic chemistry is being taught, and a
              seminar series is  being run on careers in the physical sciences in order to
              induce  female students to consider physical science degrees.
