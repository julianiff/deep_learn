Abstract    :
              9627281  Dickey     The University of California- Santa Barbara will continue a
              project  initiated earlier to facilitate development, testing, and  calibration
              of new and existing sensors and systems for ocean  science research on a
              testbed mooring near Bermuda.  The goal of  this project is to test various
              sensors for long-term deployments  as part of the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series
              (BATS), JGOFS, and  GLOBEC global change research projects.  The project will
              make use  of an existing mooring, Altomoor II, that is sponsored by the  Office
              of Naval Research.  The testbed mooring will serve two  important functions: 1)
              to provide a platform for developing and  testing emerging interdisciplinary
              sensors and systems and 2) to  provide high frequency, long-term
              interdisciplinary data to sample  variables relevant to upper ocean physics,
              optics, biology,  biogeochemistry, and carbon fluxes at a site regularly
              sampled  using ships and sediment traps.
