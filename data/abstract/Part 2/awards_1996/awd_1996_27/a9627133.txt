Abstract    :
                  This action funds a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral  Research
              Fellowship in Biosciences Related to the  Environment for 1996.    The
              fellowship supports research and training in the area of  ecology.  Ecological
              diversity in the montane meadows of the  Sierra Nevada altered by livestock
              grazing is being studied  to determine the causes and consequences of spatial 
              variation in the re-establishment of native graminoid  species.  A rule-based
              model will incorporate site-specific,  qualitative, and anecdotal information
              to predict shrub-  graminoid dyanamics at a given site.  A series of field 
              experiments will investigate the interplay between causal  processes regulating
              graminoid recovery and physical  conditions, such as water availability, known
              to be  important in determining ecological parameters.  This study  bridges the
              gap between ecology and resource management by  combining quantitative and
              qualitative knowledge to  determine the information necessary to evaluate the 
              ecological consequences of alternative management options.
