Abstract    :
              COBURN  DMS-9627455  The Department of Mathematics at the State University of
              New  York at Buffalo will purchase a configuration of a server  and nine
              workstations which will be dedicated to support  research in the mathematical
              sciences.  The equipment will  be used for several research projects:  problems
              associated   with receptors in sensory physiology; a computer program 
              implementation of an algorithm of Bestvina and Handel for  the Nielsen-Thurston
              classification theorem; fluid particle  and porous media flows, and modeling of
              island morphologies  in strained solid films.
