Abstract    :
              9627984  HARDIN    The Department of Mathematics of Vanderbilt University will 
              purchase a dual processor DEC UNIX AlphaServer 2000/250 with 256  MB of memory
              and 6 GB of storage, 6 NCD HMX20 X-Terminals,  licenses for Fortran 90 and C++
              compilers which will be dedicated  to the support of research in the
              mathematical sciences.  The  equipment will be used for several research
              projects, including  in particular:  investigation of conservation laws using
              by  Professor John Ahner, research on conjectures in graph theory by  Professor
              Mark Ellingham, developing applications of local  orthogonal bases by Professor
              Doug Hardin, investigating the  controllability of connected plates and beams
              using numerical  methods by Professor Mary Ann Horn and research into splines
              and  their applications by Professor Larry Schumaker.  These research  projects
              are all currently limited by the computational resources  now available to the
              investigators.
