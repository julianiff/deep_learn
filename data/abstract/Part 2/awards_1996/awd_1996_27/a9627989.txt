Abstract    :
                HRD-9627989  University of District of Columbia    "Behavior of Stratified
              Sand-Gravel Composites Under Seismic  Liquefaction Conditions"    The proposed
              research is to provide an investigation of the  behavior of stratified
              sand-gravel composites under seismic  liquefaction conditions.  The behavior of
              stratified soils will be  evaluated for different gravel contents.  The effect
              of variation  of confining pressure on the liquefaction parameters of
              sand-gravel  composites will be investigated for two methods of sample 
              preparation, namely pluviation through air (representing uniform  soil
              conditions) and sedimentation (representing layered soil  conditions).  The
              stress-controlled automated cyclic triaxial tests  at the University of the
              District of Columbia will be used for the  purpose of evaluating liquefaction
              potential.    The primary objective of the proposed study is compare the
              behavior  of stratified and homogeneous sand-gravel composites under seismic 
              liquefaction conditions for various gravel contents and confining  pressures. 
              Such comparison will enhance our understanding of soil  behavior under seismic
              liquefaction conditions.  As a result, a  conceptual framework for analytical
              studies can be made.    The proposed project will only provide a fundamental
              advancement  for modelling these layered soils, but also improve the research 
              capability of the civil engineering program at the University of  the District
              of Columbia.  Student exposure to the experiments will  enhance the
              representation of minorities in engineering  disciplines.  ***
