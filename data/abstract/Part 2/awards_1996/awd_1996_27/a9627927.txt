Abstract    :
              9627927  Hoffman   The PI proposes to continue his studies of the earth's most
              recent magnetic polarity reversal, Matuyama-Brunhes (M-B) in lavas in Tahiti,
              and to integrate this record into a global model of the M-B reversal process
              using available data sets from other lava flows and reliable sedimentary
              sequences worldwide.   The study of geomagnetic field reversals is rapidly
              evolving in its degree of sophistication with recent successful 3D
              computer-assisted simulations of the dynamo process.  These advances make
              essential an understanding of actual field behavior at Earth's surface obtained
              from the paleomagnetic record.  Available data of the Matuyama-Brunhes reversal
              obtained from lavas from 4 sites about the globe and recent 40Ar/39Ar age
              determinations on these lavas support not a singular process in which the
              virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) migrates along a south-to-north geographic
              track, but rather a more complicated process involving a series of dynamo
              events and long-standing field configurations.   The PI requests funding to
              continue his effort over the next two years to (1) sample several parallel
              sections recording the reversal, (2) develop further a composite chronological
              picture of the reversal process as experienced on Tahiti, (3) perform
              paleointensity determinations on these rocks whenever possible using a
              newly-modified multispecimen technique, and (4) construct a global model for
              the Matuyama-Brunhes reversal process using available data from sediments.  
              This RUI will continue to involve a number of undergraduate physics majors at
              California Polytechnic.
