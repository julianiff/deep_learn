Abstract    :
              9627216  Chandler    The New England Aquarium (NEAq) will develop a traveling
              exhibit  and associated programs to focus on parallel scientific and 
              environmental issues facing Lake Victoria (East Africa) and North  American
              fisheries.  The NEAq is working in partnership with the  national Museums of
              Kenya (NMK).  This project results from NSF  supported research on Lake
              Victoria biodiversity crises and a  workshop that involved 70 scientists,
              policymakers, and resource  managers.  A 5,000 sq. ft. exhibit "Lake Victoria:
              Mukasa's Tear"  will be developed that will present both the Lake Victoria and 
              North American fisheries issues in six modules including:  Biodiversity Then
              and Now; Changing Life Styles; Lake Victoria  Timelines; Fisheries Technology;
              Global Markets; and Towards the  Future.  Complementary educational programs
              will include on-site  interpretation, special programs for K-12 classes,
              teacher  workshops and curriculum materials, special events.  The exhibit  will
              open at NEAq in 1998 and will begin its national tour in 1999.   A second
              version of the exhibit (which will be funded separately),  will be shown in
              Kenya.
