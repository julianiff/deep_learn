Abstract    :
                9627333 Edgar  This research project aims for fundamental understanding of
              factors controlling the polytypes and phase stability of epitaxial multilayers
              and alloys of SiC combined with AlN and GaN. Vapor phase epitaxy of layered
              structures and alloys such as SiC/AlN/SiC, (AlN)x(SiC)1-x  and (GaN)x(SiC)1-x
              of  high crystalline perfection, controlled compositions, polytypes, and
              interfacial quality will be studied. The approach is oriented to relating basic
              chemical and processing conditions associated with epitaxial growth to the
              multilayered structures or polytypes realized.  X-ray diffraction techniques
              will be used to study dependence of thin film crystal quality, strain, local
              atomic configuration, and polytype on the processing conditions, substrate
              material, orientation, and composition.  Additionally, thermodynamic factors
              stabilizing these structures and alloys, and kinetic barriers preventing
              decomposition to bulk stable forms will be evaluated. %%% The research will
              contribute basic materials science knowledge of technological relevance to
              advanced electronic/photonic materials synthesis and processing.  Additionally,
              the knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is expected
              to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced devices
              and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing
              and processing more advanced materials.  An important feature of the program is
              the integration of research and education through the training of students in a
              fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***
