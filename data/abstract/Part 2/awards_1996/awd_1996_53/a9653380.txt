Abstract    :
                                                           Project Summary:  This course
              presents 25 undergraduate teaching faculty with the principles and applications
              of optics in engineering. A mixture of lectures demonstrations, hands-on
              laboratory experiments and projects, represents the core of this proposed
              enhancement program. Participants will be provided with a prepared  set of
              notes on most topics which will be covered, including Fourier analysis,
              diffraction theory, interferometry, geometrical optics, fiber optics,
              holography, photoelasticity, shearography, Moir  methods, optical data
              processing methods, nondestructive testing, and digital image processing. 
              Participants will have intensive work experience with the latest in optical
              equipment and related instrumentation, much of which is computer controlled.
              Oakland University possesses outstanding applied optics facilities, which will
              enable participants to work with the modern instrumentation. In addition, the
              very latest equipment available will be borrowed from manufacturers and
              suppliers and set-up in Oakland's laboratories for participant use. As a
              follow-on effort, the investigators will assist the participants to implement
              applied optics programs and laboratory experiments at their home institutions.
