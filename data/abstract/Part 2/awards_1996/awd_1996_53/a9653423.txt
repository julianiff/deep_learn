Abstract    :
                         All college and university science faculty, not just the "thin chalk
              line" of science educators, should be prepared to make science more inclusive
              and engaging; all science education faculty should maintain a strong science
              background and a high level of research enthusiasm. The purpose of this two
              year project is to facilitate reciprocal science success for college/
              university science faculty who have taught less than five years and science
              education faculty who have taught five or more years, in order to improve
              preparation of future teachers, especially for urban environments. In all, 24
              participant pairs will attend four day workshops, plan and implement
              collaboration for at least one full semester at their home institution, and
              assisted by project staff, conduct an outreach activity on their own campus.
              Participants will have on-site urban science experiences at the elementary,
              secondary, and collegiate level and instruction in strategies to engage
              minorities in active learning, the use of AAAS science standards, and
              assessment techniques. Teams will construct rubrics and performance assessments
              to evaluate their own home-based collaboration and outreach projects with
              particular attention to ways that science education faculty can become more
              connected to local science research activities to improve science education for
              future teachers. Collaboratively, science and science education faculty will
              design strategies to enhance the active participation of minorities in science
              and teacher preparation on home campuses.
