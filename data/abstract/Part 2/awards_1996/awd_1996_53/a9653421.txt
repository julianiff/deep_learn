Abstract    :
                         The grant application proposes a conference to be held at the
              University of Pittsburgh, in association with the Journal of Economic
              Education. The conference aims to advance the integration of new instructional
              technologies into the teaching of economics at the undergraduate level which,
              for reasons outlined in the project narrative, has been slow to take advantage
              of new and innovative teaching methods. The proposed conference will review
              recent applications of new technologies and ways of overcoming institutional
              and other obstacles that have slowed the pace of innovation. Presenters will be
              carefully screened to assure that the teaching methods discussed have either
              demonstrated effectiveness or built-in capabilities for monitoring
              contributions to student learning.      The conference proceedings will be
              disseminated in a topical issue of the Journal of Economic Education and
              abstracts of the papers will be available at the JEE's web site. The organizers
              propose to follow-up the conference by working with participants to apply and
              evaluate the teaching methods featured in the program.
