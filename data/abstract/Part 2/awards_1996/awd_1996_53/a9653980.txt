Abstract    :
              This pilot program provides a beginning model for systemically reforming and
              improving undergraduate content courses, with particular attention to the
              teaching models they provide for students preparing to be teachers.  The
              courses are being redesinged by Action Based Research Teams (ABRT). There are
              three ABRTs, each composed of a scientist/mathematician, a science/mathematics
              educator, a pre-service teacher, and an in-service teacher.  Each team is
              resposible for a specific course.  The three courses being redesigned are: a
              two semester introductory chemistry course (about 2000 students, approximately
              20% intend to become teachers); a year long biology course (about 250 students,
              approximately 80% intend to become elementary school teachers); and a one
              semester introductory geology course (about 50 students) designed specifically
              for students preparing to become K-8 teachers.  Courses are being restructured
              to help students better understand the concept of the science while at the same
              time providing models for activities that can be used for teaching these same
              concepts to elementary or high school students.
