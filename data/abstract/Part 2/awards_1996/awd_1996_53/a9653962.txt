Abstract    :
              This project will develop a framework for implementing a statewide plan to
              improve the preparation of science and mathematics teachers in Texas.  Led by
              Dr. Mauro Castro, Chair of the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M
              University-Kingsville, it will 1) design and develop a series of
              inquiry-driven, technology-infused modules to be concurrently integrated into
              the science and mathematics curriculum at the nine partner universities; and 2)
              organize a subset of Texas Presidential Awardees, comprised of Texas' nominees
              for the NSF Presidential Award for Excellence in Science and Mathematics
              Teaching, to serve in an advisory capacity to the Collaborative and to assist
              in developing the Texas Presidential Awardees Alliance, comprised of all 168 of
              the state's Presidential Awardees.      These two interrelated activities will
              involve teams of university faculty from science, mathematics, and education
              representing nine universities; teams of exemplary science and mathematics
              teachers from approximately 20 school districts; and administrators from K-12
              schools, community college and university partners.  Importantly, these
              objectives will be integrally tied to the continued development of a full
              implementation plan to improve science and mathematics teacher preparation
              programs across the state.
