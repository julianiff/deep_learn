Abstract    :
                 This project is supporting the design and construction of interdisciplinary
              student projects for the three semester calculus sequence. This builds on
              Rockhurst's four years of experience as a major implementation site for Project
              CALC, the calculus reform program from Duke University. The focus of the
              development efforts is on the creation of well-defined projects which are more
              authentically connected (through introductory readings and carefully sequenced
              analytical activities) to their scientific disciplines. Additionally, projects
              emphasize the collection as well as the analysis of data using  technologies
              such as computer algebra systems, universal lab interfaces, and the Internet.  
               Dissemination of the projects and support of instructors using the materials
              are being accomplished by (1) a three-day summer faculty workshop entitled
              Interdisciplinary Projects for Calculus, (2) a dissemination network which
              includes distribution of the projects via FTP and the creation of an
              Interdisciplinary Student Projects for Calculus Website, (3) commercial
              publications, and (4) presentations and workshops at regional and national
              meetings.    These activities add quality interdisciplinary student projects to
              the collection of materials currently available for revitalized courses in
              calculus. The projects are distinguished by their careful attention to placing
              applications of calculus in their scientific context and by encouraging
              students to become more involved in problem solving through the collection and
              analysis of data.
