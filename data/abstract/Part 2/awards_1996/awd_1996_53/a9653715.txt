Abstract    :
                The traditional presentation of mathematics and science requires that students
              reason their way to the connections between these fields.  This expectation is
              particularly challenging for many urban high school students and nontraditional
              college students. New York City Technical College, of the City University of
              New York, is building on its successes as a partner in CUNY's Alliance for
              Minority Participation and as a principal in the NYC Urban Systemic Initiative
              with a project that helps students make these connections and succeed.    The
              project team, including engineering technology, math and science faculty is
              revise the ten math and science courses in the core curriculum.  They are 1)
              explicitly identifying the mathematics and science connections in and among
              these courses; 2) developing problems that integrate science and math in
              experiential contexts and cultivating well-developed critical thinking skills;
              3) identifying the most effective pedagogical strategies and technologies; 4)
              reviewing the sequencing of topics in the core mathematics, science, and
              introductory engineering technology courses students typically taken
              concurrently; 5) creating a database of common concepts and terminology, and 6)
              designing a program of training for full-time and adjunct faculty which
              includes video tapes.    This project is institution-wide, systemic and
              significant for much of the nation's higher education community, especially its
              technical colleges.
