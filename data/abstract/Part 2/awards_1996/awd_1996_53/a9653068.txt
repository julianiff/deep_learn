Abstract    :
                This project will develop, refine, and investigate a calculus learning
              environment, called CalcLab, which is based on a set of interactive physical
              devices, with computer interface. In this environment, students will be guided
              by written materials in activities that involve exploration, experimentation,
              and problem solving around the central concepts of calculus and thereby enrich
              their understanding of these concepts. Such a learning environment will be
              helpful in giving access to calculus to those students who have traditionally
              not been well-served by courses in the subject, as well as deepening the
              understanding all students have of it. This project builds on themes underlying
              the current calculus reform movement and implements research findings of the
              Principal Investigators on a research project funded for the last four years by
              the National Science Foundation. In addition to those students in college
              calculus courses who will be helped by the CalcLab learning environment,
              pre-service and in-service high school mathematics teachers will benefit
              through the opportunity to think more deeply about the central concepts of
              calculus than they have in their past training. The principal activities over
              the 2 1/2 year funding period are that the CalcLab devices will be made more
              robust, materials that will guide students in the use of these devices will be
              written in collaboration with college calculus teachers, an instructor's manual
              will be written based on these collaborations, in-depth studies of students'
              learning in this environment will be carried out and published, and
              instructors' professional development in connection with the use of such
              environments will be undertaken.
