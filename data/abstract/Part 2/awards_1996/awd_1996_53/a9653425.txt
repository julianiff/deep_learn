Abstract    :
              The American Physiology Society (APS), in collaboration with the National
              Association of Biology Teachers (NABT) and the Human Anatomy and Physiology
              Society (HAPS), are fostering improvement of undergraduate life sciences
              education by supporting the formation of collaborative working relationships
              among life sciences faculty at 2- and 4-year colleges (including community
              colleges), physiology research faculty, and physiology teaching faculty. 
              Specifically, the project is promoting the creation of ongoing working
              relationships among triads of faculty from the three groups noted above through
              research and curriculum development experiences, and computer networks; and
              promoting the adoption of national reforms for undergraduate content and
              effective pedagogical techniques among undergraduate faculty through curricular
              materials and in service activities developed collaboratively by these triads.
              The project is promoting the establishment of long-term collegial relationships
              that benefit all members.  Initially, the 2- and 4-year college faculty members
              work with a physiology research faculty member on a summer research experience,
              attend sessions on effective pedagogy during a summer institute at the HAPS
              annual meeting and, subsequently, work with the other members of the triad to
              collaboratively develop new curricular materials for the undergraduate life
              sciences classroom.  Interested triads will then go on to develop and conduct a
              local professional development workshop for life sciences faculty in their
              geographic area.  Curricular materials developed during the project will be
              field-tested, edited, and published by NABT.  The project is designed to allow
              the continuation of these activities as a part of the long-term activities of
              the APS Education Office.
