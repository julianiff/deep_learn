Abstract    :
              During the past three years, a lecture/laboratory course on the Chemistry of Art
              has been developed with support from NSF (DUE/CCD). This is a materials-science
              course on the fabrication, examination, conservation and authentication of
              artifacts and it is an attractive and effective means of teaching science to
              non-scientists.  Experience gained during the development and initial
              dissemination of the course structure and content are being used to develop a
              text.  Case studies for the course (e.g., on the Sistine Chapel ceiling) are
              being completed for publication on CD-ROM. The first CD-ROM will present, in
              collaboration with the National Gallery of Art, a restoration archive for The
              Feast of the Gods, by Bellini/Dosi/Titian,, a famous "triple Decker" of three
              paintings on a single canvas, one on top of the other. The development of these
              course materials will be guided by formative and summative evaluation. The
              pedagogical program has spontaneously spawned an attractive research program,
              involving undergraduates... and this will continue to be developed. Projects
              underway include (i) tracing artistic influence through pigment analysis, (ii)
              authenticating a disputed Impressionist painting, and (iii) assessing
              restoration rough computer imaging.
