Abstract    :
                 This proposal addresses the problem created by the lack of geometric
              computing in the curriculum. The lack of interdisciplinary foundation courses
              in geometric computing affects student success in subsequent graphics,
              engineering design, or mathematics courses, as well as student retention and
              employability in product design and manufacturing related software development.
                The primary objective of the project is to design a comprehensive geometric
              computing course to address interdisciplinary issues for second-year students
              in computer science, engineering, and mathematics. Furthermore, this project is
              developing the courseware (textbook, lab manual, videos, and web-site
              applications) and interactive animation software systems to explore aspects of
              geometric computing.   The impact of this project is to provide students with
              the basic skill for handling geometric problems, understanding the limitations
              of finite precision on geometric problem solvers, and to prepare students for
              geometric applications in science and engineering. The impact of this project
              is also expected improve the retention rate of students and the employability
              of graduates in product design and manufacturing related software development.
