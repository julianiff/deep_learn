Abstract    :
               Building on classroom materials developed for the National Weather Service
              (NWS), the COMET Program will create an innovative pilot module of interactive,
              laboratory investigations for undergraduate introductory atmospheric science
              courses. This pilot module entitled: "Weather Satellites: Types, Imagery and
              Applications", is developed in collaboration with educators experienced in
              curriculum, course, and materials development.  It  engages non-science majors
              in active and visual representations, replacing existing, static laboratory
              materials with four-dimensional illustrations of atmospheric sciences concepts
              and weather phenomena.   The project provides interactive data collecting
              activities, and related field experiment guidelines.  Additionally, it provides
              imbedded K-12 classroom activities for the estimated (up to) 20% of
              introductory course students who will go on to teach.  Materials are developed
              in the context of "best teaching practices" and science content standards
              published by the National Research Council (1996).    Project is the initial
              step toward the creation of a series of comprehensive, contemporary laboratory
              activities for introductory weather and climate courses.
