Abstract    :
              Eight of the universities that prepare over 80% of all K- 12 science and
              mathematics teachers in Puerto Rico have formed an alliance with the Puerto
              Rico Department of Education, through the Resource Center for Science and
              Engineering to carry out a strategic planning process for the reform of science
              and mathematics teacher preparation programs as part of the ongoing K-16
              systemic educational reform. Building on the Puerto Rico Statewide Systemic
              Initiative and the Puerto Rico Alliance for Minority Participation, a Blueprint
              for Achieving Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teacher Preparation in
              Puerto Rico will be developed through the collaborative efforts of these eight
              institutions and K-12 teachers participating in the standards-based reform.
              Three island wide conferences will be implemented during a six month period to
              facilitate and strengthen the inter-institutional strategic planning process.
              The main topics of the three conferences will be: I) defining and building
              consensus on the central issues and specific changes needed to align Teacher
              Preparation Programs (TPP) with Content and Professional Standards for science
              and mathematics; 2) facilitating a strategic planning process at the
              institutional level to reform TPP, that will ensure a highly participative
              process that harnesses the creative capabilities of faculty; and 3) the
              elaboration of a Blueprint for Achieving Excellence in Science and Mathematics
              TP in Puerto Rico, which will integrate the diverse institutional strategic
              plans. Broad participation in these conferences will be promoted to ensure the
              involvement of stakeholders at all levels and from all institutions, including
              faculty, students and administrators, staff from the Department of Education
              and K-12 teachers participating in the reform, and representatives from the
              local chapters of the National Council of Mathematics Teachers (NCTM) and the
              National Science Teachers Association (NSTA). Up to 200 participants are
              expected to be directly involved in this endeav or, who will impact others
              within their institutions. PR-SSI/PR-AMP staff will be in charge of the
              implementation of the project and will support the institutional planning
              process at each institution and promote inter-institutional collaboration and
              articulation through periodic meetings between conferences. The Blueprint
              produced through this project will serve as the basis for the reform of science
              and mathematics teacher preparation in Puerto Rico, fostering their alignment
              with standards of excellence, and ensuring high quality in the preparation of
              the future instructional workforce needed to sustain the reform.
