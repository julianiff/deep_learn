Abstract    :
              Industry-Education Conference on Workforce Development for the U.S.
              Semiconductor Industry    Developing a competitive, world-class technical
              workforce for our nation's  semiconductor industry is a big challenge facing
              our country today. Major expansions in this critical industry are occurring in
              Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico, Virginia and Maine.  Community colleges and
              secondary schools in these states are ramping up programs to prepare the needed
              workforce.       This project continues a successful national conference on
              advanced technological education in semiconductor manufacturing that has served
              as a forum for educators and industry people to share best practices, learn
              about industry needs, and enhance faculty capability through presentations and
              workshops.  The project funds annual conferences in 1997 and 1998.
