Abstract    :
                                This project will establish a consortium to promote
              incorporation of molecular modeling into the undergraduate chemistry
              curriculum. The consortium will be initiated by summer workshops in molecular
              modeling for college chemistry faculty. The workshops will make use of computer
              hardware and software purchased In 1995 with the help of funding from the
              National Science Foundation. College faculty will sign up for a week of study
              in the theory and application of molecular modeling as it applies to the entire
              chemistry curriculum. The workshops will emphasize links between laboratory
              experimentation and modeling on the computer as well as the use of modeling in
              various lecture courses. After the workshops, participants will communicate
              through the Molecular Modeling Consortium. The follow-up and dissemination of 
              participant's results will be conducted electronically by use of the Molecular
              Modeling Home Page (www.molecules.edu) which is already in place.         The
              project will be directed by individuals having 10 years experience in molecular
              modeling and 20 years of experience using computers in chemical education.
              Dissemination of modeling experiments already developed is underway and will
              continue as other new experiments are refined.
