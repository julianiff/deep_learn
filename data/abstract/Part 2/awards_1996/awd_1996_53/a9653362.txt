Abstract    :
              Summer Institute in Demography    The College of Arts and Sciences at
              Fayetteville State University requests support for a week-long Summer Institute
              in Population Studies with a focus on African American demographics. The
              Institute is intended to enhance the teaching of selected sociology faculty
              from undergraduate colleges and universities particularly those from
              Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The Summer Institute
              offers intensive seminars and programs to improve faculty participants
              knowledge on social demography with special emphasis on African Americans.
              Faculty members in sociology and related fields in the social sciences who
              teach in undergraduate programs will be selected to participate in the summer
              Institute.      The major objective of the Institute is to encourage the
              participants to incorporate demographic methods and data into the undergraduate
              curricula. This will enhance the teaching effectiveness of demographic and
              population studies courses, and introduce a multi-cultural framework to the
              curricula by using a comparative perspective with focus on African Americans. 
              An earlier workshop conducted in the summer of 1992, with a 2-day follow-up in
              the summer of 1993 was very effective in achieving this objective.
