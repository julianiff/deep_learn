Abstract    :
                                                    PROJECT SUMMARY    During the two-year
              span of this project, a two-week faculty seminar on Teaching  Introductory
              Physics Using Interactive Methods and Computers will be held at Dickinson 
              College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. These seminars will be part of a series that
              began in 1990.    The goal of the seminars is to help introductory physics
              teachers develop pedagogical  approaches that enable their students to learn
              physics using guided inquiry and computer  tools to explore "real world"
              phenomena. The two-week seminar will be offered in the  summers of 1997 and
              1998 for thirty invited participants.    Topics covered will include:
              interactive instructional strategies based on outcomes of  educational
              research; assessment of student learning gains; laboratory design; computer 
              interfacing; use of spreadsheets and graphing packages; data and error analysis
              techniques;  the application of laboratory interfacing and real time data
              analysis to laboratories and  lecture demonstrations; numerical problem solving
              and modeling; and digital video  frame capture and analysis for the study of
              motion, heat and temperature, and  electrostatics.
