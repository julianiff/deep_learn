Abstract    :
              This is an 18-month planning project to continue the work that has begun on the
              ND-CoMSTeP project.  The goals of the planning project are to improve the
              original ND-CoMSTep project through increased involvement of scientists and
              mathematicians in preservice teacher preparation.  A two-day summer conference
              will be held for North Dakota scientists and mathematicians.  Those wishing to
              take a more active roll in teacher preparation will be given time at the
              conference to develop plans for their own institution. Two other trial
              initiatives will be a part of this planning grant. The first of these is the
              establishment of three teams, each consisting of a preservice mathematics
              teacher and a university mathematician.  They will work together to teach a
              university calculus class at a local high school. The second initiative
              involves undergraduate science majors working for approximately ten hours per
              week as teachers' assistants to master teachers at a local junior, or senior,
              high school. Each science major will meet with his/her academic science
              advisor, and science educator, once every two weeks.  These meetings will be an
              opportunity to talk about teaching, its rewards, its challenges, and the
              possibility of preparing for dual careers in science and science teaching.
