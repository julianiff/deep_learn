Abstract    :
                         The proposed work would expand the implementation and dissemination
              of a successful strategy to foster interdisciplinary research perspectives
              among undergraduates at an urban university. Results from a prior NSF CCD award
              showed how to respond to challenges from 1) nontraditional students with weak
              academic skills, 2) widespread environmental degradation, 3) employers seeking
              graduates with multidisciplinary and highly technical skills and 4) a
              compartmentalized university curriculum. This program is called Cognitive
              Apprenticeships in Environmental Studies (CAES) as students practice their
              understanding in the content of its professional use. A series of exercises are
              placed throughout the traditional science curriculum. Although in disparate
              courses, the exercises are unified by 1) a focus on a specific, local
              environmental catastrophe and 2) the exchange of samples  and data collected by
              students. In effect, students in different courses become part of the same,
              interdisciplinary research team investigating problems that potentially affect
              their lives. To these experiences are added student participation in internship
              programs, advisement services and other activities that build a student
              community aware of environmental science. Proposed activities emphasize 1)
              development of more course materials, 2) broader implementation in the
              curriculum, including modules in courses for nonmajors and future teachers, and
              3) wider dissemination of the CAES strategy through presentations at
              professional societies and Internet publications. A strategy is devised to
              address changes in the social, academic and biological communities of Los
              Angeles, but many other institutions of higher education are experiencing
              similar changes and would benefit from wider dissemination of our efforts.
