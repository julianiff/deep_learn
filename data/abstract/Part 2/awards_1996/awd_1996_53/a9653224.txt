Abstract    :
                   This project is providing a model for curriculum reform that focuses on
              problem-solving and real world applications in introductory mathematics at
              two-year colleges. The courses of focus are college algebra and statistics, two
              courses of great importance for the technical workforce. Three objectives are
              being accomplished: 1) revision of the mathematics curriculum, incorporating
              work-based experiences technology, an interactive learning environment, and
              traditional curriculum development activities; 2) expansion of faculty dialogue
              throughout the mathematics community (secondary, two- and four-year
              postsecondary); and 3) provision of faculty development opportunities to
              support collaborative teaching methodology, student engagement in learning, and
              curriculum development. Methods used to accomplish these objectives include: 1)
              interaction with local businesses and industries through site visits,
              shadowing, and internship opportunities; 2) participation in professional
              development activities to increase teamwork and interaction; 3) increase in
              understanding of learning styles, collaborative learning, and use of technology
              as a tool for problem-solving; and 4) team efforts to develop, pilot, refine,
              and implement new teaching methods, work-based problems, and student
              interaction. Diaries of math applications in the workplace are being kept by
              faculty participants as they visit, shadow, and intern with local businesses
              and industries. Teaching portfolios are being developed by faculty participants
              for dissemination, detailing the types of learning activities and methodologies
              introduced into classes, what was successful and why, and students' reactions.
