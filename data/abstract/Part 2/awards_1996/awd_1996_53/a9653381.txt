Abstract    :
              This proposal is broadening the horizon of mathematics educators in the region
              and in the nation through the production of twelve workshops, four during each
              of the summers from 1997 through 1999, for college faculty. The workshops are
              focusing on technology and applications in undergraduate mathematics. Each
              summer features a one-day overview workshop, a three-day workshop on
              calculators in undergraduate mathematics emphasizing applications in entry
              level mathematics, a three-day workshop on computer algebra in undergraduate
              mathematics with participation by professional engineers showing working
              applications of mathematics, and an Internet workshop which enables
              participants to learn about all forms of electronic communication and
              facilitates establishment of their own presence on the Internet. Each of the
              three-day workshops accommodates 25 participants. Of particular note is the
              involvement of secondary school teachers in the workshops, and recruitment
              strategies and workshop activities that target faculty involved in pre-service
              teacher preparation courses and programs. Additionally the project is hosting
              two three-day conferences during the summers of 1998 and 1999 on the
              applications of computer algebra systems to education and research in the
              mathematical sciences. The research portion of the conferences is supported by
              Oklahoma State University. These conferences feature a strong interaction among
              mathematics educators and researchers.
