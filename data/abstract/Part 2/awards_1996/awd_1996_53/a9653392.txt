Abstract    :
              A short course is being offered during the summers of 1997 and 1998 focussing on
              laser technology and its applications to solving chemical problems. The
              offering consists of an eight day exposure to both the theory and practical
              applications of lasers to all branches of chemistry. The course includes (1)
              lectures on the fundamentals of lasers and related topics including their
              applications to chemistry, (2) laboratory experiments done by all participants
              illustrating the principles presented in the lectures, including the
              applications.  A major feature of these short courses is that the materials
              presented and experiments done are directly transferable to the participant's
              home institution. All aspects of the course are appropriate for inclusion in
              the undergraduate curriculum.
