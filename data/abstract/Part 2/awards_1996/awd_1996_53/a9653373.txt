Abstract    :
                The project is providing opportunities for Missouri undergraduate mathematics
              faculty to review and consider the implications of emerging secondary and
              undergraduate curriculum reform/materials. Four conferences serve as the forum
              in which faculty can learn about and discuss reform. In two of these
              conferences, teams of high school mathematics teachers and college faculty are
              participating to further systemic efforts at mathematics reform across multiple
              levels.  Significant follow-up activities are taking place to encourage and
              support reform efforts across the state that will help faculty and teachers
              develop and implement curriculum changes in both new and existing courses.  The
              specific objectives of the project are facilitation of:    1. 
              College/university mathematics faculty in their review of NSF-sponsored
              undergraduate curriculum materials and the development of related instructional
              materials for courses they teach.    2.  Discussion and study of undergraduate
              curriculum-related issues including new mathematics content, new instructional
              approaches, and emerging technologies.    3.  College/university mathematics
              and high school mathematics faculty and teachers in their review of
              NSF-sponsored secondary curriculum materials and the development of related
              instructional materials for courses they teach.    4.  Discussion and study of
              secondary curriculum and examination and revision   of Missouri mathematics
              teacher preparation programs.    Monographs generated from each conference are
              being provided for each participant and each mathematics department chair in
              the state of Missouri.
