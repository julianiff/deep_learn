Abstract    :
              9653966  Sternheim     The Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
              Teacher Education Collaborative (STEMTEC) links the members of the Five
              Colleges, Incorporated consortium - the University of Massachusetts Amherst and
              Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke and Smith Colleges - with the three area
              community colleges, Springfield Technical, Holyoke, and Greenfield, and the
              neighboring school districts in a collaborative effort to promote reform in the
              science and mathematics preparation of teachers.  PALMS, the Massachusetts NSF
              State Systemic Initiative program, and the Continental Cablevision Corporation
              are also participating.  In order to improve the preparation of pre-service
              teachers, stimulate the interest of undergraduate science and mathematics
              majors in the teaching profession, and increase the educational effectiveness
              of science and mathematics courses, the collaborative draws on its expertise to
              make use of effective active-learning strategies: cooperative learning,
              investigation-based teaching, educational technology, new assessment
              techniques, and opportunities to teach.  Teams including college science,
              mathematics, and education faculty members are re-designing existing college
              courses and creating new ones.  The teams include K-12 teachers who
              participated in earlier NSF supported collaborative ventures to improve teacher
              preparation, and who have adopted these teaching strategies in their own
              classrooms.  The project is developing strategies to attract students to
              science and mathematics teaching, especially women, under-represented
              minorities, and rural and inner city residents.  Strong assessment and
              dissemination components are accompanying a comprehensive program of course
              reform and preservice teacher education that can serve as a national model.
