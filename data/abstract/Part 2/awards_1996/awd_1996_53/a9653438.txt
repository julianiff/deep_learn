Abstract    :
              The project is holding a Summer Conferences on Faculty Scholarship: Combining
              Excellence in Research and Innovation in Physics Education. This two-week long
              conference will be held in the summers of 1998 at Harvard University and be
              open to about 35 participants. Priority will be given to young faculty, faculty
              who teach (or will be teaching) introductory physics, and women and minority
              faculty. The goals are to:    1. Help narrow the gap between the research and
              education communities in physics;  2. Introduce faculty to educational
              innovations that can be readily implemented;  3. Develop curricular materials
              for a new approach to teaching introductory physics.    The conference will
              include presentations on leading edge research and educational innovation,
              workshops on educational technologies, and group work on curriculum
              development. Research talks will be by members of the  faculties of Harvard
              University and MIT, with a preference for faculty who are not only active in
              research but also have an interest in education. For the presentations on
              education we will draw from a broader national pool of speakers. An important
              criterion for these talks will be that the pedagogies, innovations, or
              educational technologies presented must be ready and easy to implement at the
              participants' home institutions. The participants will receive detailed
              materials to take home. Lastly, to make the participants stakeholders in the
              process of educational innovation, they will collectively work on the
              development of tutorial worksheets, conceptual questions, and a variety of
              problems for a new conservation-law based curriculum for introductory physics.
              A number of activities are planned to evaluate, and follow up on, the
              conference.
