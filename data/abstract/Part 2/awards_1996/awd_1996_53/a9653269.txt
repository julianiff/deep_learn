Abstract    :
              The Trainer System is a novel way to teach programming to beginners. This unique
              approach stresses the development of programming fluency at a rudimentary
              level. The Trainer system was designed to help even the weakest students master
              the fundamental skills of algorithmic expression. Students who have used the
              Trainer system consistently report that it was more helpful to them in learning
              programming than anything else - more helpful than lectures, more helpful than
              textbooks, more helpful than traditional programming homework. The Trainer
              system includes closed lab software and a lab text. These components are
              carefully integrated so that students get immediate practice with simple
              programming constructs, as soon as those constructs are covered in the text. 
              We believe that systems developed from the current Trainer will be useful to
              other four-year colleges, two-year colleges and high schools. The project will
              benefit many students; not only computer science majors, but students from any
              of the many different scientific and engineering disciplines that require
              elementary computer programming competence.
