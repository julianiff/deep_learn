Abstract    :
              A collaboratory is the logical generalization of the laboratory in the age of
              telecomputing.  It unites scientists to do science together, even if apart in
              space and time.  A collaboratory for education unites faculty, students, and
              scientists to work together to learn science by doing science.  A collaboratory
              for undergraduate education will give faculty and students access to science
              resources - instruments, experts, and information - for instruction and
              research, and is the logical generalization of the student laboratory for
              colleges and universities.    A consortium of higher education institutions -
              the Northwest Educational Collaboratory Consortium (NECC) - and the
              Environmental & Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) of the Pacific Northwest
              National Laboratory (PNNL) will follow a recent planning workshop         The
              EMSL-Collaboratory in the Undergraduate Classroom  with a week-long, in-depth,
              exploratory workshop for NECC faculty and EMSL scientists, Exploration of an
              EMSL-Collaboratory for Undergraduate Science Education at the EMSL in September
              1996.  This workshop is to explore the feasibility of a full-scale, model
              development project.
