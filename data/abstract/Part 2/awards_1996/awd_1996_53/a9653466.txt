Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary Summer Institutes on Puget Sound    The proposed project
              focuses on Puget Sound, a 200 mile waterway extending from Vancouver Island and
              the Canadian border to Olympia, Washington. This waterway has a rich history
              and provides an ideal environment for studying a variety of interdisciplinary
              topics and issues.    The purpose of the project is to upgrade the technical
              content of faculty from two- and four- year colleges in Washington State
              relative to the cultural history, current environmental issues, and the ecology
              of Puget Sound; to provide the opportunity to learn about new interdisciplinary
              curricular designs, and to learn and try out new field techniques and new
              pedagogical approaches.    Three six- or seven-day interdisciplinary summer
              institutes focusing on Puget Sound will be offered over the two-year period of
              the grant. The three institutes will have a total of 75 faculty participants
              from two- and four-year colleges. Follow-up activities after the institutes
              include a small seed grant program, follow-up sessions, an end-of-project
              symposium on Puget Sound, and communication among the participants via Internet
              and a newsletter. Various end products include a slide set, an annotated
              bibliography and a resource guide.    The Summer Institutes, which are the core
              of the project design, are miniature versions of some of the most successful
              interdisciplinary programs in the state. They provide a "high challenge"
              curriculum and are based upon pedagogical principles that are recommended by an
              increasingly convergent literature on improving education in the sciences.
