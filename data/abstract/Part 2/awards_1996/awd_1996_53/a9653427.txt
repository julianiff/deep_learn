Abstract    :
               Free molecular visualization software of truly excellent quality became capable
              of running "movie" scripts (RasMol) and web-based tutorials (Chime) during the
              past year.  This makes it feasible for every student of the biological sciences
              at the high school level and beyond to produce colored, space filling, 3D
              images of biological macromolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, etc.) on PC's/Macs,
              whenever they are studying them or have an interest. Faculty can now accompany
              lectures with attention-getting projections from the PC screen, showing
              scripted tutorials of real molecular structures, and students can later review
              them.  Rotation of the structure effectively conveys 3D relationships without
              the need for stereo images or special glasses. Student and faculty responses to
              lectures accompanied by pilot scripts have been extremely positive, with
              immediate demand for scripts covering a wider range of topics.    The goals of
              this project are to (1) hold 3-day workshops in the Northeast to prepare
              undergraduate faculty to use molecular visualization in their classes; (2)
              demonstrate "movie" scripts and web tutorials at large national meetings of
              biological scientists/educators; (3) develop a series of new tutorials on
              topics designed by faculty for use in large undergraduate classes; and (4) to
              make the resulting resources freely available through Internet web sites. 
              Workshop participants will be given follow-up support, encouraged to share
              experiences and educational methods through an email listproc.  Each
              participant will be required to mentor two additional faculty at their home
              institution in the use of educational molecular visualization.
