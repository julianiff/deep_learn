Abstract    :
                The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) proposes a three-year plan to
              improve the teaching of undergraduate microbiology at the nation's two- and
              four-year institutions. This proposal will also support new faculty and/or
              postdoctoral fellows with a commitment to undergraduate teaching. The proposed
              program builds on previous experience of the Society in supporting
              undergraduate faculty.    The project will:  Increase faculty members'
              understanding of recent advances in the microbiological sciences and their
              familiarity with the Society's core content recommendations for the first
              course in microbiology; increase the number of faculty who are able to
              incorporate active learning into their classroom and laboratory instruction;
              improve the career development of new faculty and postdoctoral fellows who are
              considering academic careers which will involve significant teaching of
              undergraduate students; and facilitate sharing, disseminating, and evaluating
              resources available to improve the teaching of microbiology in the lecture hall
              and the laboratory.    The project will culminate in  a forum (the
              Undergraduate Microbiology Education Conference) for the development,
              dissemination, and assessment of effective learning strategies for the teaching
              of the microbiological sciences at the undergraduate level.  Activities prior
              to the forum will increase access to this forum by faculty from two-year and/or
              minority-serving institutions who might not otherwise be able to participate
              due to financial, disciplinary, or geographic barriers.
