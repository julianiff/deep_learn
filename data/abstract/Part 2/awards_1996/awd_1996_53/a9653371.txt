Abstract    :
              An Engineering Faculty Enhancement Workshop on:           THE ECONOMIC
              PRINCIPLES OF ENGINEERING DESIGN         It is widely accepted that 70-80
              percent of a product's total costs over its life cycle are determined during
              conceptual/preliminary design. Yet the impact of the design activity upon the
              ultimate success (or failure) of a product is not fully integrated with
              economics in most engineering curricula across the United States. The mission
              of this workshop is to address this shortcoming by "educating the engineering
              educators" in how to integrate economics and design in the undergraduate
              curriculum.     Our central purpose, therefore, is to provide a workshop to
              transfer knowledge regarding the economics of engineering design to all
              engineering faculty who teach design-intensive courses. This knowledge was
              gained, in part, from a three-year multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional
              National Science Foundation grant entitled, "Integration of Economic Principles
              with Design in the Engineering Science Component of the Undergraduate
              Curriculum" (DUE-9155917).      During 1996 two three-day workshops and a
              one-day follow-on workshop were funded by NSF's UFE program.  In view of the
              strong reception for our 1996 workshops dealing with "The Economic Principles
              of Engineering Design," we will offer two more workshops in 1997 (each 2 days
              in duration). Participation in each will be limited to 25 individuals in order
              to encourage dialog and in-depth interaction with the workshop instructors.
              These workshops will be followed by a one-day colloquium in 1998 during which
              teaching experiences and curricular issues associated with courses presented in
              the workshop will be discussed by participants who have implemented these ideas
              at their respective institutions.
