Abstract    :
              The objective of our NSF grant (USE 91-56112) was to support the development and
              evaluation of a new curriculum and supporting materials focused around the
              practice of computing. The keystone of our new curriculum is a four-course core
              sequence which incorporates closed laboratories. Lecture materials and content
              are supportive of the laboratories rather than the other wayaround. We are
              presently in our fourth year of development with the first three core courses
              firmly in place and with the fourth course taught for the second time this
              Spring, 1996 semester.    We are ready to begin active dissemination efforts.
              We are conducting a Workshop for Course Curriculum Change Using C++ and the
              Closed Laboratory Model this Summer, 1996 (NSF-DUE-9554715). Based on the
              overwhelming response we received, we propose to offer this workshop again and
              other dissemination efforts during Summer, 1997.      This proposal requests
              support for a more aggressive dissemination effort. Specifically, we propose a
              four-prong approach:    1. A Mini-Workshop for the participants of this year's
              (1996) NSF UFE Summer Workshop for Course  Curriculum Change Using C++ and the
              Closed Laboratory Model (DUE-9554715) to assess the impact of the Summer, 1996
              workshop.     Two new workshops for Summer, 1997:    2. the first one (Workshop
              for Course & Curriculum Change Using C++ and the Closed Laboratory Model) will
              be similar to the Summer, '96 workshop for faculty who have a working knowledge
              of C, but not C++ and are interested in implementing the closed laboratory
              model in their CS curriculum.  3. the second workshop (Workshop for C++ Syntax
              and Course and Curriculum Change Using the Closed Laboratory Model) will focus
              more on the specific needs of Community College faculty, high school Advanced
              Placement Computer Science teachers, and faculty from colleges and universities
              who do not know C or C++.    4. Panel Presentations at regional small college
              computing conferences by workshop participants and UVA faculty.      We believe
               these efforts will enable the participants' schools to enhance their computer
              science curricula in a contemporary and efficient manner and will help other
              schools to begin thinking about their curricula needs.
