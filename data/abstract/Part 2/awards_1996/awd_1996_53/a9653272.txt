Abstract    :
                 Many of today's chemistry students, particularly in community colleges, are 
              nontraditional. They are older, economically disadvantaged, they work many
              hours off campus, and often come from under represented minorities.
              Unfortunately, they are also under prepared to succeed in college. The
              application of computer technologies can help us shape new strategies that
              promote learning, achievement and retention of these students and thus increase
              our educational productivity.     The goal of this project is to improve the
              learning of chemical concepts through the increased use of computer
              visualization. A team, consisting mainly of undergraduate students from our
              college, will produce chemical visualization software in a highly modularized
              form and will disseminate it at very low cost through both the Internet and
              CD-ROMs. We will test the viability of this approach as a learning experience
              for students.     These software products will also benefit students nationwide
              by supplementing traditional instruction with the power of visualization. They
              will help chemistry and biology teachers make the transition to instruction at
              a higher level of technology and could be useful in constructing course
              materials for distance education.
