Abstract    :
              Parallel Computing for Undergraduate Faculty    The purpose of this project is
              to prepare undergraduate faculty to teach parallel computing. When participants
              have completed the course which we will  offer, they will be prepared to add
              parallel computing to their curriculum, either by integrating topics on
              parallel computing into existing courses or by teaching one or more courses
              specifically on parallel computing. In addition, participants will be ready to
              assess the feasibility of establishing a parallel computing laboratory at their
              own college. The course will begin with an intensive two-week session in the
              summer of 1997. This course will include lectures surveying the broad scope of
              parallel computing and instruction on the design and implementation of parallel
              algorithms. About half of the course time will be spent on hands-on development
              and implementation of parallel programs using the parallel computers at
              Colgate. During the fall, participants will work on projects, with site visits
              from the instructors where possible. At the follow-up session in January or
              February, 1998, participants will present their project results and will have
              an opportunity to discuss the practical aspects of teaching parallel computing
              to undergraduates.         A second group of participants will follow a similar
              pattern with a course in  the summer of 1998, project work and a follow-up
              session early in 1999.
