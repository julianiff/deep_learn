Abstract    :
              Abstract: The City College of the City University of New York proposes an
              initiative to reform the undergraduate experience of science and engineering
              students. The project builds upon the experiences of several curriculum
              development projects at the College, using their methods as widely applicable
              curricular models and their faculty as mentors to colleagues. A central aim of
              the proposed initiative will be to increase the engagement of faculty in
              undergraduate education. Strategies will include: changing the reward structure
              for faculty in support of innovative teaching; formal faculty training in
              curriculum design, assessment, uses of technology and other topics; a
              faculty-to-faculty mentoring and support system; and providing immediate
              opportunities to participate in cross-disciplinary curriculum development
              teams. The following outcomes will be achieved: a college-wide plan for
              curricular reform in SEM will be defined; an active SEM faculty teaching caucus
              will meet regularly to promote, advise upon, and evaluate curriculum reform
              initiatives; a faculty resource center, the Center for Teaching and Learning,
              will be operational and serving as a stimulus for specific curricular reform
              activities; model curriculum modules and other instructional innovations will
              be in place in five science and engineering courses; an increased number of
              science and engineering faculty will have expertise in curriculum reform; and a
              new system for developing faculty members' expertise in teaching and for
              assessing their candidacieq for tenure and promotion will be in effect. The
              institutional reform project at City College is expected to significantly
              enhance the College's success in the recruitment and retention of SEM
              undergraduates, substantially improve the number and quality of SEM
              baccalaureates, better prepare graduates for the SEM professional workplace,
              establish the administrative structures necessary to ensure the long-term
              operation of new programs and activities, and provide an SEM educational mode l
              which can be replicated at other institutions.
