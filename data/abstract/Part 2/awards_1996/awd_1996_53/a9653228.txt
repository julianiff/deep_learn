Abstract    :
                In response to increasing evidence as to the ineffectiveness of the
              traditional introductory physics course at improving students' conceptual
              understanding of physics and problem-solving ability, a series of workbooks,
              SPIRALPhysics, have been developed and used in place of a standard textbook in
              the introductory physics course sequence at Monroe Community College (MCC) for 
              the past several years. These workbooks, designed for use in an active learning
              environment, arrange topics such that students receive repeated exposure to
              concepts over an extended time interval, each time with an incremental increase
              in complexity. The workbooks make extensive use of alternative problem types,
              such as ranking tasks, goal-less problem statements, and critical analysis
              tasks.    This project proposes the expansion and modification of the workbooks
              to make them a more attractive and viable alternative to traditional physics
              instruction at other institutions. In addition to the increased flexibility
              afforded by an expanded workbook series, support materials, including an
              instructor guide, student guide, and textbook, will be developed as part of the
              project. Revision of the workbooks and support materials will continue
              throughout the length of the project, under the supervision of an advisory
              committee drawn from both the two-year college physics community and the
              physics education research community.  The project also gives special emphasis
              to community college students in Advanced Technological Education (ATE)
              programs to ensure that they are provided learning opportunities using the
              spiral notebooks.
