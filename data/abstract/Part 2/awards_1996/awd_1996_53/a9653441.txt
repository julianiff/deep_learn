Abstract    :
              Enhancing Undergraduate Psychology: A Program for Faculty from Two-Year and
              Small Four-Year Colleges    Prince George's Community College, Largo, MD (PGCC)
              will develop and conduct a four-day workshop for 24 psychology faculty from
              two-year and small four-year colleges in the mid- Atlantic states during summer
              1997. Workshop topics, developed from a survey distributed to two-year faculty
              in four states, include: biopsychology, research methodology and statistics,
              implementation of technology in psychology courses and its effect on student
              performance, and the integration of multiculturalism into the curriculum.
              Follow-up activities include the development of teaching modules based on
              workshop topics and a one-day return workshop at PGCC during spring 1998.   
              Some of the speakers who have agreed to address these topics and work with the
              faculty in developing their teaching modules include: Thomas V. McGovem,
              Arizona State West; Douglas A. Bemstein, University of Illinois at Urbana-
              Champaign; Virginia Andreoli Mathie, James Madison University; Kent Norman,
