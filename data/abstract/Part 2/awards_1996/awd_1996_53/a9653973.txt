Abstract    :
              The purpose of the New Mexico Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher
              Preparation (CETP) is to improve the science, mathematics, and technology
              preparation of future K-12 teachers and their effectiveness as educators in
              these vital areas.  The goal will be achieved by accomplishing five exciting
              objectives:    Reforming content and teaching by designing an innovative,
              integrated curriculum    Developing policies which require improved math and
              science preparation of teachers    Supporting novice teachers through a strong
              support system during critical early years    Increasing diversity in the
              teachin profession through innovative recruiting, retention, and instruction
              which serve diverse groups, particularly American Indians    Disseminating
              results - including innovative materials - to instutions nationwide    The New
              Mexico CETP represents a partnership of five universities, four community
              colleges, 11 public school districts, two state agencies, and two national
              laboratories.   This proposal is the result of a two-year planning effort by
              these partners.    Among the innovative features of the New Mexico CETP are
              novel plans for:  1) Science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET)
              departments to integrate future teachers into their culture; 2) Teacher
              placement in the schools and early professional development, and 3) Mechnisms
              to recruit individuals who already have degrees but either are not certified to
              teach or lack a strong SMET background.    The collaborative's partners believe
              this program will provide a grand change in teacher education in New Mexico by
              improving the preparation of teachers in SMET fields.
