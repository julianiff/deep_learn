Abstract    :
              Project Kaleidoscope (PKAL) is sponsoring a series of workshops that continues
              the current focus on programs that work, and incorporates a more intentional
              focus on institutions that work. Our intent is to build networks of individuals
              and institutions, regionally and nationally, that are committed to working
              together to transform science, mathematics, engineering, and technology
              programs in institutions of all kinds, in all parts of the country.    Building
              on the similar prior activities, the project will host workshops during 1997 -
              1998. Each workshop will involve 10 - 14 presenters who are recognized within
              their disciplinary and educational community as reflective practitioners in the
              field of educational reform. Teams of approximately three people, from 20 - 24
              different institutions, will participate in each workshop; host sites for each
              of the workshops will be institutions that are demonstrably seeking to
              transform their undergraduate SME&T programs. Topics to be covered by the
              series of workshops include the wide range of issues that must be addressed by
              faculty and administrators in the process of achieving institutional and
              programmatic reform that succeeds over the long-term.    These workshops fit
              into the larger goals of PKAL: to facilitate comprehensive reform at over 500
              colleges and universities across the country, by equipping institutional teams
              for their leadership role; to provide leadership opportunities for the PKAL
              Faculty for the 21st Century network; and to encourage national action
              supportive of local efforts to enhance and improve undergraduate SME&T.
              Extensive activities have been planned to disseminate materials from the
              workshop (particularly through the World Wide Web) and to evaluate the impact
              of PKAL activities on participating campuses.
