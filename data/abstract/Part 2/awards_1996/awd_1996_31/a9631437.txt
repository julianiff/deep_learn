Abstract    :
              Elmore, David  Purdue U.   This research will use cosmogenic nuclide techniques
              to address a classic issue in mountain geography-the spatial pattern of
              valley-scale glacial erosion.  The debate which centers about the mechanics of
              process in the formation of glacial landforms is unresolved.  A constraint has
              been the lack of reliable knowledge of the pre-glacial form.  Cosmogenic
              radionuclides in rock do provide information about past erosion of material
              from the rock surfaces.  This information coupled with approaches that predict
              the spatial pattern of erosion as a function of erosion mechanisms and controls
              can provide new understanding of valley-scale erosion patterns and processes. 
              To test the approach, cosmogenic nuclide techniques will be used to measure
              bedrock loss at study sites in the Middle Popo Agie drainage basin, Wyoming and
              the South Yuba River Gorge, California.  The research will demonstrate how
              cosmogenic nuclide approaches can be used to reconstruct large-scale patterns
              of bedrock erosion.  The results will enhance our understanding of valley-scale
              topography and provide new information on the role of landscape development in
              altering the relationship between climate change and glaciation.
