Abstract    :
              This award supports a one-and-a-half day workshop to develop a  policy framework
              for deploying security technologies on the  Internet. The workshop was
              recommended at the Federal Networking  Council Advisory Council meeting in
              October, 1995 to provide  guidance for Internet planners. This followed the
              recommendation  for such a workshop made by the Federal Networking Council
              Security  Working Group. Workshop participants include industry, Federal and 
              user community representatives. Specific topics addressed include:          *
              Security technologies now available and in development        * Security
              requirements of Federal, industrial, educational             and foreign
              networks and users        * Requirements for creation or enhancement of
              existing             institutions to handle crisis response, public keys, etc. 
                   * Need for research in security techniques       The result is a report
              detailing the workshop conclusions, and is  available in printed form and on
              the Internet.
