Abstract    :
              9631708  Conrad    The  goal of this research planning grant is to provide  the 
              investigator  with knowledge of the operation  of  the  High  Resolution   Low 
               Energy  Electron   Diffraction   (HRLEED)  instrument and the analysis of the
              diffraction line shape to  determine the long range order and defect morphology
              of both  metal and insulating surfaces.  Preliminary study of diamond  and
              stepped tungsten surfaces will carried out.  %%%  The  goal of this research
