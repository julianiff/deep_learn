Abstract    :
              9631897  Castro    This Americas Program award will fund travel and related 
              expenses for five U.S. mathematicians to participate in the  1996 Summer School
              in Partial Differential Equations to take  place in Bogota, Colombia, July
              22-August 2, 1996.  Organizers are Dr. Alfonso Castro, University of  North 
              Texas and The Summer School will emphasize Elliptic Partial  Differential
              Equations, Quantic Groups, Mathematical Biology  and special Functions.  Each
              course ranges from introductory  background to state of the art research
              problems.    The aim of the activity is to establish relationships  between
              U.S., Colombian and foreign mathematicians,  discovering and encouraging young
              talent interested in  graduate work and fostering research collaboration among 
              different groups.  Participants in the school include,  besides U.S. and
              Colombia, other countries in the Americas:  Mexico, Venezuela, and Brazil, as
              well as participants from  Spain, New Zealand, Holland and Germany.  Thus, this
               presents an excellent opportunity for multi-national  cooperation in research
              and education.    ***
