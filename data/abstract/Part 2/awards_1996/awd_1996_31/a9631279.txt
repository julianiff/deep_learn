              Weitz    The  proposed research will develop a novel, general purpose  and 
              widely applicable method to use light scattering to non-evasively  measure  the
               elastic  properties of 'soft' materials.  This  new  technique will extend
              significantly the range over which  elastic  properties  an be measured and
              will directly relate the  response  of  the  medium to its internal dynamics.
              The technique  will  be  exploited to obtain new insight into the origin of the
              elasticity  in   a  variety  of  disordered,  or  glassy,  'soft'  materials, 
              including  colloidal  suspensions near  their  glass  transition,  polymer  
              solutions  and  polymer  melts,  compressed  emulsions,  networks of
              bio-polymers such as DNA and actin, and slowly  aging  systems.  %%%  The
              proposed research will develop a novel, laser-based method to  non-invasively 
              probe essential properties of  a  wide  class  of  materials,  including  gels,
              and biomolecules  such  as  DNA  and  actin,  a  fibrous molecule that imparts
              strength to  cells.  The  technique   will  measure  the  mechanical 
              properties   of   the  materials, thus determining whether their behavior is
              more 'solid-  like'  (as  in  gelatin) or fluid-like (as in  honey),  and  will
               significantly  extend the range of applicability  of  traditional  methods. 
              The knowledge gained by these studies will provide  new  insight  into
              underlying origins of the mechanical properties  of  the   materials 
              investigated..  It  will  also  facilitate   the  application of the materials
              in commercial or medical areas.  ***
