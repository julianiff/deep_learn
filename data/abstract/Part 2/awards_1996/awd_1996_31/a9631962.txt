Abstract    :
              9631962  Etzel  The overall goal of this proposal is to develop an 
              experimentally based model that describes the sorption of  proteins from
              complex biological fluids, e.g., human blood,  onto affinity membranes, and
              from this model, the elution  process that follows.  The sorption
              characteristics of the four human IgG proteins  on an immobilized protein G
              membrane will be determined, a  model developed, and experimental breakthrough
              times  compared with model predictions for each protein.  The second aim of the
              proposal is to determine the effect of  naturally-occurring components of human
              plasma on the  sorption model.  Components such as other proteins, sugars, 
              salts, and lipids may have much lower affinities but are  generally present in
              larger quantities.  Finally, the proposal aims to develop a mathematical model 
              of the elution of the protein from the affinity ligand.  This model will be
              valuable in optimizing the process  variables, e.g., pore size, flow rate, etc.
