Abstract    :
              9631072  Terns    RNA transport and localization are required steps in the gene
              expression pathway essential for the growth, differentiation and development of
              all eukaryotic cells.  This research will determine how specific cellular RNA
              molecule is targeted to the distinct subcellular compartments by testing to
              hypothesis that the intranuclear maturation and targeting of U3 small nucleolar
              RNA to nucleoli is the result of specific interactions between discrete
              sequence domains of the U3 RNA and specific proteins and other intranuclear
              structures.  Important U3 RNA nucleotide sequences will be identified by
              microinjecting "tagged" variant U3 RNAs and hybrid RNAs into Xenopus oocytes
              and assaying the ability of these RNAs to become localized to nucleoli.  The
              intranuclear distribution of radioactive or fluorescent-tagged U3 RNAs in
              oocyte nuclei will be determined by both subnuclear fractionation and light
              microscopy.  The general significance of observations of U3 RNA will be tested
              by similar analysis of the closely related U8 small nucleolar RNA.    RNA
              transport and localization are required steps in the gene expression pathway
              essential for the growth, differentiation and development of all eukaryotic
              cells.  This research will determine how a specific cellular RNA molecule is
              targeted to the distinct subcellular compartments by testing the hypothesis
              that the intranuclear maturation and targeting of U3 small nucleolar RNA to
              nucleoli is the result of specific interactions between discrete sequence
              domains of the U3 RNA and specific proteins an other intranuclear structures. 
              U3 RNA is required for the processing of pre-ribosomal RNA into mature
              ribosomal RNA in the nucleolus; failure localize U3 RNA in the nucleolus will
              prevent ribosome production and result in cell death.  This research will
              provide general insight into the mechanisms that direct trafficking of RNA to
              subcellular sites of function.
