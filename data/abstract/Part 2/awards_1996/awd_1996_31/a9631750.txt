              Earth Observatory  Title; Climate Change in Mongolia and its Role in Global 
              Environmental Change    This awards supports a paleoclimatic study in Mongolia.
               This is a  remote nation which has only recently become accessible to western 
              scientists, and from which there is paleoclimate information to  date. 
              Forests, particularly in montane regions, are largely  undisturbed.  Tree-ring
              analysis of samples from living trees and  subfossil material is likely to
              produce time series of millennial  length with annual and seasonal resolution. 
              With samples from high  -elevations and lower-elevation dry sites; tree-ring
              analysis will  yield time series to reconstruct both temperature and
              precipitation  respectively.  These reconstructions will be important long-term
               climatic information from near the central portion of the world's  largest
              continental region.  The resulting climatic reconstructions  and evaluations
              will make strong contribution to climate history of  this important region to
              evaluations of climate change in Mongolia.
