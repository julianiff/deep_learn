Abstract    :
              The purpose of the project is to refine several inequalities and  to extend some
              theorems pertaining to Nielsen extensions of  finite Riemann surfaces and to
              obtain moduli for surfaces which  remain constant in the Nielsen extension
              process.  These results  would lead to a better understanding of the
              relationship between  a surface and its Nielsen extension and the
              classification of  conformal structures on Riemann surfaces.    Numerical
              methods using mathematical software such as Mathematica  and Geomview will be
              utilized in investigating the problems by  obtaining numerical and graphical
              approximations of a conformal  function mapping a Nielsen convex region onto
              the upper half-plane.
