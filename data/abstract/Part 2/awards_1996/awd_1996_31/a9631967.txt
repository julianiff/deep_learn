Abstract    :
              9631967  Walker   This work will involve the molecular cloning and
              characterization of the R-mb complex of maize. The organization of the complex
              as a whole will be determined through the production of derivatives of the R-mb
              complex that have lost one or more genes through unequal crossing over. The
              number, identity and expression of each individual gene of the complex will be
              determined. The specific regions of the complex involved in paramutagenicity
              will be determined and a more limited structural characterization of a diverse
              collection of R geographic alleles will be made.  Undergraduate students will
              be introduced to basic biological research by working on the described
              projects.   %%%  Epigenetic inheritance, nuclear inheritance that is not based
              on DNA sequence, has been recognized in all of the eukaryotic kingdoms. To
              approach the question of why certain genes are subject to epigenetic regulation
              while others are not, the structures/sequences of epigenetically regulated
              genes must be determined. The R paramutation system of corn is ideal for an
              analysis of this phenomenon because the important components have been
              localized to the R locus itself and there are a diverse set of alleles with
              different phenotypes available. Detailed structural analysis of the paramutable
              R-r complex suggest that a small region of only about two kilobases out of 200
              kb is involved in the paramutation process.  ***
