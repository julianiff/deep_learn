Abstract    :
              Eddy  9631248  This is a project for training pre-doctoral and young
              post-doctoral statisticians in  cross-disciplinary research and teaching. 
              Training of Ph.D.-level statisticians for effective service should emphasize
              these two central elements of statistical activity.  There will be project     
                                        six on-going  cross-disciplinary research projects:
              in cognitive psychology; in functional magnetic resonance imaging; in genetics
              and psychiatric statistics; in statistical physics; in criminology,
              governmental statistics, and public policy; and in environmental statistics. 
              These will serve as the subject matter portion of the research program.      
              Effective teaching accommodates the needs of the learner; thus, the
              collaborative research in cognitive psychology is an essential part of the
              teaching element.  The program has three components: research that will guide
              training, the training program itself, and a plan for evaluation of the success
              of various components of the training program.
