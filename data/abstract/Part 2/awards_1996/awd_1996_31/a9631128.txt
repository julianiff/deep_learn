Abstract    :
              9631128  Snyder    Cytochrome P450 enzymes are perhaps the most diverse family
              of proteins in nature.  They are found in all organisms thus far examined and
              have extensive abilities to metabolize foreign chemicals (xenobiotics) and
              endogenous molecules such as steroids and fatty acids.  One of the driving
              forces for P450 diversification is thought to be the appearance of toxic
              chemicals in the diet, the so-called  plant-animal warfare" hypothesis.  In
              mammals, one hundred or more P450 forms may exist in a single individual, each
              with its own metabolic capabilities. Likewise, insects appear to have a  large
              number of P450 forms, some involved in insecticide and dietary plant
              allelochemical resistance. Marine invertebrates also have demonstrable P450
              enzymatic activities that are inducible by exposure to pollutants, though
              virtually nothing is known about the role of detoxification enzymes in marine
              invertebrate to dietary chemicals.  New information on this group of enzymes
              may help explain aspects of individual species diet and metabolism as well as
              identify factors that affect tolerance to other xenobiotic exposures.    The
              investigator proposes to utilize molecular cloning approaches to isolate and
              identify new cytochrome P450 genes from several marine invertebrate species
              representing three different Phyla (Aim 1).  Those data will provide the first
              estimate of the diversity of this large protein superfamily among marine
              invertebrates. The induction of gene expression for selected new proteins
              belonging to this family will be studied in both field collected species and in
              controlled laboratory feeding experiments (Aim 2).  Antibodies will be produced
              to several new forms for the design of sensitive immunological assays to
              measure P450 induction in response to toxin exposures (Aim 3). Since there are
              currently no marine invertebrate P450 sequences known, these studies will
              provide much needed information about the diversity of these important enzymes.
               The results will allow comparisons concer ning the evolution and functions of
              detoxification enzymes between marine and terrestrial organisms.  An eventual
              goal is the development of methods that will test species-specific responses
              following exposure to natural and artificial toxicants.
