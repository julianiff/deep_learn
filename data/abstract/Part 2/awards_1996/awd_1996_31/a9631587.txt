Abstract    :
              9613587  Blanchard  The goal of this research is to provide opportunities for 
              senior students in the Biological and Agricultural  Engineering (BAE)
              Department at North Carolina State  University to design, build, and deliver
              projects to aid the  disabled.  The completed projects will be given to
              specific  clients or groups of clients to the Tammy Lynn Center (which 
              provides residential and educational programs for children  and adults with
              developmental delays) and the Governor  Morehead School (the only
              state-supported school in North  Carolina specializing solely in comprehensive
              educational  and residential programs for students with visual  impairments),
              both in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Through this  effort, BAE students will be
              able to directly improve the  quality of one or more lives while gaining
              valuable design  experience for themselves.  They will also be exposed to new 
              possibilities for future study and work in rehabilitation  engineering. 
              Twenty-one potential projects have been  identified by the staff at the Tammy
              Lynn Center (e.g.,  outdoor swing for an adult wheel chair, voice-activated 
              multi-sensory toy with interchangeable parts, low cost bath  chair for raising
              and lowering a 100%-assisted person,  etc.), while six additional projects have
              been proposed by  the staff at the Governor Morehead School (e.g., balanced 
              ball that makes a sound or plays music only when triggered  by a remote device,
              combination locks that can be used by  the visually impaired on their school
              lockers).   The  proposal anticipates the design, building, and delivery of  an
              average of 12 projects per year over a 5-year period.  ***
