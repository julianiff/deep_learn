Abstract    :
              9631321  Barbieri  Robotic welding's success has primarily been limited to
              repetitive  and taught-welding tasks.  This project seeks to apply robustness 
              and adaptability to the welding process so that the robot can  successfully
              complete changing tasks while minimizing human  intervention.  The proposed
              research employs proven advanced design  techniques in Nonlinear Control
              skillfully adapted to handle the  complexity of a robotic welding process in a
              very innovative manner  which has not been previously reported elsewhere.  The
              industrial  participation by Laitram coupled with the investigators' expertise 
              present the two ingredients necessary for a successful project.   Results from
              this research will have immediate positive  implications in several industries
              such as Ship Building  (Avondale), Rig Building (McDermott), Manufacturing
              (Laitram), and  other sheet metal and structural fabrication.  ***
