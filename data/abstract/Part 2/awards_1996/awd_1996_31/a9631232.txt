Abstract    :
              9631232  Baumgartner    Interest groups have long been seen as important actors
              in the policymaking process  and yet scholars remain deeply divided about the
              means by which interest group influence is achieved.  Prior studies have
              disagreed about whether interest groups act as pressure groups or service
              bureaus, and about the reasons why one group plies the issue networks of
              Washington while another turns to the grass roots beyond the beltway. 
              Methodological difficulties have prevented past studies from testing theories
              of how different political circumstances affect the lobbying tactics groups
              choose, and have created conundrums such as why mass media tactics are used
              equally by insider and outsider groups.    This Doctoral Dissertation Research
              project resolves the methodological problems of past research by linking data
              on many groups to data about specific issues.  The project, involving a mail
              survey of 2,500 interest groups and corporations and in-depth phone interviews
              with a subsample of 200 survey respondents, is methodologically innovative in
              that questions about tactic choice will be linked to specific issues selected
              by the respondents themselves.  Tactic use is linked to particular sets of
              political circumstances, making it possible to test a context-sensitive theory
              of strategic choice of lobbying tactics.  ***
