Abstract    :
              9631049  Makowski  This grant requests funding for a conference to explore the
              principles underlying our understanding of the structure and activity of
              macromolecular assemblies.  The conference will take place in the second week
              of January, 1997, in Tallahassee, Florida.  There will be two full days of
              scientific sessions with talks from approximately 25 speakers.  We expect an
              attendance of 100-150 scientists.    In 1962, Caspar and Klug introduced the
              concept of quasi-equivalence to explain the arrangement of proteins on the
              surface of icosahedral virus particles.  The concept has played an important
              part in shaping our study and understanding of viruses and other macromolecular
              assemblies for the past 30 years.  In those 30 years the amount of information
              that we have obtained about proteins has exploded, and the original concept,
              based on electron microscope studies, has been refined to take into account the
              remarkable results on the structure of crystalline viruses and other
              protein-protein interactions.  Nevertheless, it survives as a philosophical
              basis for much of how we think about macromolecular assemblies.    By
              organizing this conference, we seek to bring together the individuals who were
              involved in the development of the concept from its origins, and those who have
              generated high resolution information about macromolecular assemblies and
              viruses over the past 30 years.    Most of the principal speakers have already
              agreed t participate in this conference.  This may be one of the last chances
              we have to bring together the originators of the concepts with so many
              scientists who have contributed to its development.  It is an opportunity to
              summarize the principles underlying our understanding of macromolecular
              assemblies, and to define the questions we need to continue asking about the
              movement and adaptability of macromolecules.  %%%
