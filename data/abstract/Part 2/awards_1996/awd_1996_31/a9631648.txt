Abstract    :
                9631648  Gottlieb     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              addresses The need for stable sensors suitable for long term measurement of
              dissolved oxygen in seawater.  Measurement of   the dissolved oxygen in
              seawater is critical to understanding   mixing processes and oceanic
              circulation as well as for the description of water  masses.  At present there
              are no   stable sensors suitable for long-term monitoring of dissolved  
              oxygen.  A need exists for stable long term sensors and the   development of a
              reagentless optical oxygen sensor.   Commercial potential includes industrial
              applications such   as monitoring boiler water and bioreactors, automobile
              emissions testing, and environmental applications such as monitoring waste
              water.
