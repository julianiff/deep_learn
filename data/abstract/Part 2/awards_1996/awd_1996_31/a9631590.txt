Abstract    :
              9631590  Hu   This GOALI award is for the development of an
              industrial-university cooperative relationship between Variation Systems
              Analysis, Inc. (VSA, Inc.), and the University of Michigan in jointly
              developing manufacturing process simulation methodologies for deformable part
              assembly.  A Ph.D. student from the University of Michigan, under the guidance
              of an academic advisor and an industrial mentor, will   (1) gain experience in
              manufacturing process simulation;   (2) develop a new, generic mechanistic
              variation simulation methodology for deformable part assembly;   (3) validate
              the newly developed variation simulation methodology by comparing with of the
              art techniques; and   (4) apply this methodology to assembly fixture
              configuration design.   Manufacturing process simulation, in particular,
              variation simulation, can provide valuable knowledge about the characteristics
              and capability of the process, thus helps manufacturers design better processes
              to deliver quality products in a timely fashion.  However, currently available
              variation simulation methodologies are not applicable to deformable part
              assembly processes because these methodologies are based on rigid body
              assumptions.  Deformable part assembly processes are widely used in
              manufacturing automobiles, aircraft, furniture, and appliances.  The
              mechanistic variation simulation methodology will greatly enhance the
              scientific understanding of deformable part assembly product/process design.
