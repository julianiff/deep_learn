Abstract    :
                  9631166  Gallagher      A number of chemical reactions occur in cells
              affected by the loss of oxygen and by reoxygenation which occurs upon
              resumption of blood flow. One by-product of these cellular reactions is the
              formation of a highly reactive form of oxygen, known as an oxygen free radical.
              Oxygen free radicals produce alterations in DNA, the genetic material, which
              may affect the ability of cells to carry out their normal biological functions.
              Since a single change in DNA structure may be harmful, it is not surprising
              that a diverse array of mechanisms for repairing DNA evolved at the cellular
              level. The experiments outlined in this proposal are designed to examine an
              enzyme, redoxyendonuclease, that repairs oxidative damage to DNA. The levels of
              this enzyme will be quantified in the oxygen-deprived (ischemic) kidney and the
              reoxygenated reperfused) rat kidney and compared to the levels of this protein
              in the undamaged tissue. Specifically, the tissue will be examined for 1) the
              level of the oxidative DNA repair enzyme activity; 2) the cellular repair of
              oxidized DNA damage; and 3) the levels of specific oxidized DNA base damages
              formed during the ischemic or reoxygenanon event. Results from these
              experiments will provide new insights into the regulation of the cellular
              mechanisms that repair oxidative DNA damage and the ability of tissues to
              withstand conditions of oxidant stress.
