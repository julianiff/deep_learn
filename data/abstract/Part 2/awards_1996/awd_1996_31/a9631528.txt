Abstract    :
              This award in the Environmental Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry Program   is
              made to Dr. Susan L. Brantley, Department of Geosciences, and Dr.   Carol G.
              Pantano, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, both   of
              Pennsylvania State University, for research on weathering of   hornblende.  The
              work is jointly supported by the Division of Chemistry   and the Division of
              Earth Sciences.  The rate of etch pit development and   the rate of dissolution
              of hornblende under laboratory conditions will be   studied and compared to
              hornblende etching rates observed in soils.  The   effects of bacteria on
              hornblende dissolution will also be investigated   in order to isolate direct
              and indirect microbial interactions with the   mineral surface.  Changes in the
              surface will be analyzed using x-ray   photoelectron spectroscopy and secondary
              ion mass spectrometry.  Not only   will the rate of hornblende weathering be
              determined, but the role of   oxygen, acidity, pit formation, and bacterial
              reactions will be   determined.    Dissolution of hornblende is the principal
              source of iron and magnesium   to natural waters from soils developed on
              granite lithologies and is a   contributor to reduction of atmospheric carbon
              dioxide reduction through   silicate weathering.    Methods from geochemistry,
              materials and microbiology will be used to   achieve an integrated
              understanding of the nature of hornblende   weathering in the field and to
              develop a model that can be used in   laboratory investigations.
