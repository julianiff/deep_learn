Abstract    :
              Steven Durlauf  Santa Fe Institute  SBR-9631610    This research will
              investigate several topics in the area of  inequality and segregation, focusing
              on a theoretical and  mathematical model.  These topics include:  poverty,
              out-of-  wedlock births, dropping out of high school, and affirmative  action. 
              An econometric model will be developed which allows for  spillovers in
              neighborhood influences relative to these topics.   The work will attempt to
              identify the effects of changes in the  distribution of individual choices and
              the social interaction  effects of individuals and peer groups. The affirmative
              action  part of the research will look at the intergenerational  consequences
              of affirmative action.
