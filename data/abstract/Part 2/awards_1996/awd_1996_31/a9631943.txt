Abstract    :
              9631943  Gavin     In previous work under NSF support, this laboratory was the
              first to identify a myosin gene from the ciliated protozoan, Tetrahymena.  In
              this short-term continuation project, the cloning and characterization of the
              gene, termed TETMYO, will be continued and a construct will be prepared for a
              gene replacement experiment.  ***
