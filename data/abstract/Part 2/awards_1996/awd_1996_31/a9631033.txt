Abstract    :
              9631033  Dickinson  The proposed conference will provide a dynamic forum for the
               presentation and discussion of new work on laser interactions  with materials
              and applications to a number of new technologies.  This is an interdisciplinary
              conference with strong connections  to the communities of physics, chemistry,
              materials science, and  materials engineering. The conference format involves
              primarily  invited speakers with approximately one-half of each session 
              devoted to an in-depth discussion.  In addition, a poster session  will be held
              that will enable other attendees to present their  work.  %%%  The proposed
