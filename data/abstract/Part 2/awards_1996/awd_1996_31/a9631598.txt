Abstract    :
              The horizontal pressure gradient force, Coriolis force, flux divergence of
              momentum (the friction term), velocity tendency, and advection are all dominant
              forcing terms in the horizontal momentum equation important to a dynamical
              description of the Great Plains Low Level Jet (LLJ).  Efforts under previous
              grants with the PI have enabled an accurate estimate of all forcing terms
              associated with the LLJ, including friction.  The scientific objective of this
              research is to employ a fully-instrumented research aircraft as an
              observational platform to measure the forcing terms in the horizontal momentum
              equation responsible for the diurnal behavior of the LLJ.  The PI will
              emphasize the evaluation of the friction term during the period of decoupling
              attending the cessation of turbulent mixing around sunset, and the subsequent
              adjustment of the horizontal windfield.
