Abstract    :
              9631107  Beauge    Calcium (Ca) ions act as transducers of the information 
              reaching the cell surface into a language known by the cell  interior in nearly
              all animal cells.  Changes in  intracellular calcium concentrations is the
              signal that  activates functions like hormone secretion, muscle  contraction,
              and nerve-cell communication. The actual signal  is a large increase in the
              concentration of the  intracellular Ca, after which the Ca concentration
              returns  rapidly to the "resting" levels.  The research funded by  this grant
              is directed at one of the mechanisms responsible  for the "recovery" of resting
              Ca concentration levels -  sodium (Na) ion/calcium ion exchange.  The emphasis
              is on  the control of this exchange system by  two phosphoryl group  donors: 
              ATP and phosphoarginine. This work is carried out  on a giant axon in the squid
              where the internal and external  environments can be controlled by the
              experimenters..    Understanding the mechanisms by which Na-Ca exchange is 
              regulated is crucial for understanding the mechanisms that  underlie neural
              signaling in all animals.  In addition, it  is crucial for understanding muscle
              contraction.
