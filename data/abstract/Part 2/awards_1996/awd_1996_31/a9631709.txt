                                                       w:\awards\awards96\*.doc  9631709 
              Murphy    This Research Planning Grant will provide support for research to 
              investigate  the  possibility of using the newly  developed  high  mobility  
              Si/SiGe   heterostructures  (by  others)    to   study  skyrmions.  These
              skyrmions are topological many-body excitations  in  a  two dimensional
              electron system (2DES) and have at present  been  observed  in  high  mobility
              GaAs  material.   The  Si/SiGe  material  has  potential  for integrated 
              circuit  use  and  this  planning  grant will attempt to control the valley 
              splitting  in  Si/SiGe  and  tune  it  to  near zero in  order  to  enhance 
              the  prospects  to observe skyrmions.  Demonstration of tunability  is  the
              primary goal.  %%%  A  predicted new type of electron excitation in a planar
              electron  system  (two-dimensional) called skyrmions has been  observed  in 
              gallium  arsenide  material that can be made with  high  electron  mobility.
              This high electron mobility has recently been  produced  in  a 
              silicon/silicon-germanium multilayer  structure  and  this  Research  Planning
              Grant will support the investigation  of  this  new  material  in  which
              skyrmions can be identified.  Since  the  silicon/silicon-germanium material
              has potential  for  commercial  use in the electronics industry the
              understanding of the behavior  of  the  excitations  that affect the electron 
              transport  is  of  considerable interest.  ***
