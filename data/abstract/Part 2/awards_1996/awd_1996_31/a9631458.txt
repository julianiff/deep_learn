Abstract    :
              9631458  Bowman    Cereals, legumes, nuts, and fruits of angiosperms provide a
              large portion of the food that is consumed by both humans and livestock.  Each
              of these products is ultimately derived from carpels, the female reproductive
              organs of the flower.  Carpels are generated in developing flowers through the
              action of many genes.  The aim of this project is to identify the basic
              molecular and genetic mechanisms by which the development of carpels is
              directed.   Since all angiosperms are likely to utilize a common set of
              regulatory genes, by cloning and characterizing the relevant genes in the model
              species Arabidopsis, Dr. Bowman can apply the knowledge gained to commercially
              important crop species.  Genetically engineered changes in sizes, numbers,
              structure and rate of maturity of carpels will eventually be possible.  Such
              manipulations in crop species may lead to improvements in the amount and
              diversity of our food supply.
