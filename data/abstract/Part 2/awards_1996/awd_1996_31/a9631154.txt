Abstract    :
              9631154  Lim  A laboratory strain of Drosophila melanogaster produces Notch
              mutations at a rate exceeding 5% with a few sub-strains exceeding 20%. This
              exceptionally unstable genetic locus in the X chromosome is though to be due to
              an insertion of the hobo transposable element in a region of the gene that is
              not essential for expression. The hobo element interacts with other such
              elements in the X chromosome to create structural changes of two types;
              deletions or inversions which, in essence, restructure the chromosome. An
              hypothesis has been suggested to explain this remarkable high rate of
              chromosome restructuring and experiments are suggested to test the hypothesis.
              Although one hobo element from the Notch locus has been cloned, the other has
              not. That effort will be circumvented by modifying a hobo element in vitro so
              that it can be easily detected and to insert a single copy into the Uc-1 X
              chromosome. DNA sequences corresponding to both elements before and after
              inversion will be isolated, characterized and compared in order to analyze the
              mechanism involved in the molecular process of inversion production.
              Undergraduate students will be introduced to basic biological research by
              becoming involved in this research.  ***
