Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to provide a class of adaptive  nonparametric
              procedures similar to Hogg's procedures, but for  more general situations,
              including (I) testing for ordered  alternatives in the c-sample location
              problem (c>2), (ii) testing  for ordered alternatives in the c-sample scale
              problem, (iii)  testing in the c-sample location - scale problem, (iv) testing,
               estimation and multiple comparisons in the one-way layout, two-way layout and
              multi-way layout analysis of variance (ANOVA)  models.  In addition, we will
              resolve the practical problem of  handling ties.    Based on the theoretical
              arguments as well as some extensive  Monte Carlo studies, the supremacy of the
              procedures over (I) the  usual (non-adaptive) procedure of working only with
              the ranks and  the resulting statistics, such as Wilcoxon, and (ii) the usual 
              parametric procedure (based on the assumption of normality of the  underlying
              distribution function) will be established.    This project will broaden the
              knowledge and explore new  techniques related to the study of the adaptive
              distribution free  procedures in several problems in the analysis of variance 
              (univariate as well as multivariate), multiple comparisons,  estimation of
              contrasts, among others.  It will enhance the  existing techniques and assist
              the future research projects in  the related fields.
