Abstract    :
              Nicholas M. Kiefer  David Easley  Maureen O'Hara  Cornell University 
              SBR-9631583    The operation of markets and the determination of prices are 
              central issues in economics.  The research will look at financial  market
              microstructure, shifting the focus away from price  information alone. 
              Instead, the research will examine the  information contained in order flows
              with market makers.  The  assumption is that not all information is contained
              in price  data.  Information between market makers and traders is 
              asymmetrical.  The market maker changes his beliefs about the  value of the
              underlying asset as orders come in from traders,  reacting by changing his
              posted bid and ask rates.
