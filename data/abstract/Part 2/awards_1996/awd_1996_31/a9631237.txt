Abstract    :
              9631237  Grizzle  This proposal describes basic research in the modeling,
              analysis  and control of advanced technology, spark ignition engines.  The 
              goal of the research is to develop, adapt and apply system  theoretic notions
              to the problem of reducing emissions in  automobile engines while meeting
              performance and drivability  requirements.  Federal regulations are driving the
              development of  advanced engine technology to meet the ever increasing demands
              for  lower emissions.  These engines are fundamentally described by  nonlinear,
              hybrid (mixed continuous and discrete time) mathematical  models, and require
              sophisticated control systems for their proper  functioning.  The PI will
              partner with engineers at Ford in order  to have access to engine dynamometers
              for collecting the data  required to construct and validate the engine models,
              and for  evaluating modern, model-based feedback design concepts.  This is  a
              unique university-industry cooperative research arrangement for  developing and
              applying advanced system theory and control methods  to problems important to
              society.  ***
