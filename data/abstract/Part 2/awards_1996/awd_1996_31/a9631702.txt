Abstract    :
              This project involves a Career Advancement Award to Julia E. Fulghum,  
              Associate Professor of Chemistry at Kent State University.  The PI is a  
              recognized expert in X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and the   purpose
              of this award is to enable her to spend a sabbatical leave at the   National
              Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Denver, Colorado, to learn   sample
              preparation and data analysis for time-of-flight secondary ion   mass
              spectrometry (TOF-SIMS).  Both XPS and TOF-SIMS are surface analysis  
              techniques and the information they provide is complimentary.  The PI   will be
              able to expand her XPS technique development to encompass   TOF-SIMS imaging
              with emphasis on organic and insulating samples.  Part   of the work at NREL
              will involve studies on photovoltaic materials   development.  In addition, the
              PI will be able to add TOF-SIMS capability   to her on-going research work on
              the surface chemistry of materials.  The   long-term goal is to add TOF-SIMS
              instrumentation capability in her own   laboratory.  The project is supported
              by the Analytical and Surface   Chemistry Program and the Special Projects
              Office in the Chemistry   Division.  This project will enable Professor Julia
              E. Fulghum to examine the   surface chemistry of important technological
              materials such as liquid   crystals and photovoltaics using two complementary
              techniques: X-ray   photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight-secondary ion
              mass   spectrometry.   Little work is available in the literature regarding
              such   a comparison.  Imaging is one aspect of the work and correlating  
              information from both techniques will aid in understanding the artifacts   and
              limitations of each of them.  The results of the work will contribute   to the
              development of solar cells for energy conversion and the   technology of
              optical materials.
