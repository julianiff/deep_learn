Abstract    :
              Previous research has involved the application of a  reformulation-linearization
              technique of Adams and Sherali (1986,  1990) to the Quadratic Assignment
              Problem.  The goal of this  project is to investigate, identify, and classify
              different types  of specially-structured Quadratic Assignment Problems and
              other  general classes of problems that possess a similar structure.  In  this
              process the determination will be made as to which appear  most promising in
              terms of the application of this same  reformulation-linearization technique
              for the purpose of devising  optimal solution strategies.
