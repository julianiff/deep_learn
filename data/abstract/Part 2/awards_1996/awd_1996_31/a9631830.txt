Abstract    :
              9631830   Mou   This GOALI/Faculty in Industry award will explore ways to
              increase the precision and functionality of prismatic type machining centers. 
              The technical approach links analysis methods and the technology of on-machine
              and post process measurements.  In this way it is possible to enhance both
              manufacturing and inspection accuracy and precision.  This award will enable
              the principal investigator to go to Ford Motor Company's labs and collaborate
              with Ford on determining the most appropriate on-machine probing techniques,
              and defining ways to use probing data to diagnose machine tool errors.  The
              methods for identifying and diagnosing errors include on machine probing and
              compensation methods, post process inspection and analysis of systematic
              machine errors, and adaptive sensor fusion  for compensation and controlling
              precision machining processes.     This research will help approach closed loop
              control for discrete parts manufacture.  If selected production parts that are
              measured off-line by coordinate measuring machines, and this data is fed to
              machine tools with sensors and compensation algorithms on board, then it
              provides a way to continuously and adaptively improve the precision and quality
              machined parts.
