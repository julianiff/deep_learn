Abstract    :
                      Abstract  9631051  Stith    Fertilization involves a series of membrane
              lipid fusion events, however the role of lipids as intercellular signals during
              the process of fertilization is largely unexplored.  The PI has shown that
              sperm increases the amount of inositol -1,4,5-triphosphate in the Xenopus egg,
              produced by the action of phospholipase C.  the Pi has evidence that
              phospholipase D also plays a role in fertilization. Choline, the product of
              this enzyme, increases at fertilization, and an inhibitor  of the enzyme
              inhibits fertilization.    The  experiments in this grant will pursue studies
              on the action of phospholipase D in various fertilization events.   This
              research will increase knowledge of the changes in lipids that occur during
              fertilization.   ***
