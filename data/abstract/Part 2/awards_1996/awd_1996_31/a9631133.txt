                This  experimental  research project is  concerned  with  surface  phenomena
              of adsorption and  wetting, which play an important role in many physical,
              chemical,  and  biological processes. The research is based  on  a  recently 
              developed ellipsometric microscope. This instrument, developed in  the PI's
              laboratory, will be used to determine size and shape  of  droplets under
              experimental conditions. The data will be compared  with appropriate
              theoretical models. This study will enhance  our  understanding  of  how
              uniform wetting layers  form  via  droplet  growth  and  coalescence, how ions
              in the solution influence  the  phenomena of wetting and adsorption, and will
              clarify whether  or  not  orientational order is important at the surfaces of
              critical  ionic mixtures.  %%%  The  composition at the surface of a solution
              frequently  differs  from  that  in  the bulk because surface interactions 
              create  an  adsorbed layer or a wetting layer at the interface. These surface 
              effects  are  important in many  processes such  as  lubrication,  catalysis, 
              and  fluid  flow, through  biological  membranes  and  porous  media.  The work
              will use an ellipsometric microscope  to  study  the dynamics of coalescence
              and growth as wetting droplets  combine  to  form  a uniform wetting film at 
              the  surface  of  a  critical  non-ionic binary liquid mixture. The dynamics 
              will  be  studied as the temperature is varied. The influence of ions  will 
              also be studied. This work will enhance our understanding of  the  complex 
              interplay  between bulk critical phenomena  and  surface  processes, in the
              presence and absence of ions in solution.  ***
