Abstract    :
              9631396  Fischer    Lifelong learning integrates and mutually enriches the
              cultures of work and education. This integration should not be interpreted as
              "adult education," nor as giving children "jobs;" rather, it frames a vision in
              which people learn continually in the course of authentic, self-directed, and
              creative activities. Central to this vision is the notion of design activity, a
              model of work that is open-ended and long-term in nature, incorporates
              personalized and collaborative aspects, and combines technical and aesthetic
              elements. The communality that crucially binds design activities together is
              that they are centered around the production of new, publicly accessible
              artifacts.    Our proposal is focused around a vision of  how education and
              work may be seen as interwoven elements of creative design activity. We offer
              six specific hypotheses as vehicles to attain and sustain this vision, and we
              present a framework for computational domain-oriented design environment that
              reflect these hypotheses and offer a means to assess them. The research will
              develop theories about lifelong learning, will create computational
              environments necessary to support lifelong learners, will contribute to the
              restructuring of our national educational infrastructure, and will  provide a
              unique opportunity for extending not only technological developments but also
              the societal networks of working, learning and collaborating.  ***
