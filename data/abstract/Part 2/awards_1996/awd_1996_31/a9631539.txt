Abstract    :
              Databases for spatial graph management are very important for a large number of
              applications including transportation, utilities (e.g. gas, electricity) and
              urban management. This project addresses the needs of spatial graph management
              in the areas of physical database design and query processing. The main
              objective is to develop, evaluate and implement a novel spatial graph storage
              and access method, called Connectivity-Clustered Access Method (CCAM), based on
              graph-connectivity.  CCAM assigns the nodes of a graphs to disk pages via the
              graph partitioning approach to maximize the Connectivity Residue Ratio, i.e.,
              the chances that a pair of connected nodes are allocated to a common page of
              the file.  Another objective is to develop scalable spatial graph-clustering
              algorithms as well as incremental reorganization strategies to enhance CCAM. 
              This project also explores strategies to enhance existing geometric access
              methods for managing connectivity properties along with proximity properties.
              The techniques developed in the project are evaluated with benchmark graphs
              from Advanced Traveler Information System applications
