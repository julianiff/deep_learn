Abstract    :
              9631229  Francisco    New methods for collecting data on domestic conflict are
              necessary in order to extend research beyond its current boundaries.  In this
              investigation the researcher will collect domestic conflict data from 1980
              through 1995 on all European countries using new methods to satisfy the demands
              of recent dynamic models and new research programs.    Current data on domestic
              conflict suffers from age, low density and questionable validity. Yet the need
              for data on coercion and protest continues to grow.  This project uses a set of
              new organizing principles for data collection on domestic conflict and presents
              a data set that will be used widely by those interested in domestic political
              conflict.  ***
