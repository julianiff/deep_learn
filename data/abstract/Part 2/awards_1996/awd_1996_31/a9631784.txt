Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    This award supports the dissertation research of the co-principal
              investigator.      The research project will assess the influence of federal
              institutions on congressional politics in Brazil where subnational politics
              play an important role in national politics.  This award will be used to
              construct a database of electoral statistics at the national, state, and local
              levels in Brazil.  The study's central hypothesis is that, contrary to common
              expectation, electoral multipartism is not a function of district magnitude and
              timing of presidential elections but rather the concurrence between national
              and state electoral cycles and the electoral formula for gubernatorial
              elections.  By establishing a theoretical comparison between these two models
              of party competition that will be tested with empirical data, the research
              promises to make a valuable contribution not just for area specialists but for
              the comparative study of electoral systems.  The research will promote an
              understanding of federalism, the dynamics of executive-legislative relations in
              presidential systems, and the influence of subnational actors on national
              politics.
