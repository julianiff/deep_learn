Abstract    :
              9631719  Petersilia  Public opinion polls have indicated that the public's fear
              of crime is rising and people are taking behavioral precautions to avoid being
              victimized by serious crime. According to police reports, gang-related crime is
              also escalating and becoming more violent. However, crime rates are not
              increasing at a level to warrant the degree of fear currently being seen in the
              public. This research proposes to study the congruence between levels of
              gang-related crime, community characteristics (i.e., social and physical
              "disorder," community decline, racial heterogeneity) and the public's fear of
              gangs in Orange County, California. Methods will include analysis of
              officially-recorded crime statistics, focus group discussions on the fear of
              gangs, and videotaping of actual community characteristics which may predict
              gang-related fear (e.g., graffiti the presence of loitering youths). At the
              completion of the project, there will likely be a deeper understanding of the
              factors that drive fear of crime, and the research will likely have immediate
              theoretical and practical importance. Specifically, it will attempt to further
              refine the four dominant theories in the fear of crime literature and will
              inform those who are attempting to devise sensible justice policies.  %%%%
