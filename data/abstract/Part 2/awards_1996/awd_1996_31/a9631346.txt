Abstract    :
              ***  96-31346  Dhar    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              proposes to build one marketable prototype of the self-humidified PEM (proton
              exchange membrane) fuel cell stack using the deposit of solubilized Nafion
              membrane as the electrolyte.  During the Phase I project, the feasibility of
              using this electrolyte was demonstrated in small single cells and one
              multi-cell stack.  The research objectives of the Phase II include the
              optimization of performance of self-humidified PEM fuel cells, operation of
              larger fuel cells, and design and operation of one 1 kW fuel cell stack.  The
              best possible fuel cell performance will be solubilized forms of electrolytes
              that can be used as proton exchange membranes in fuel cells.  Fuel cells will
              be operated with reactant combinations H2/air and H2/O2.  Emphasis will be
              given to the operation of fuel relationships, calculations of kinetic
              parameters, efficiencies of platinum utilization, and reactant cross-over
              currents.  Larger single fuel cells of areas up to 400 cm2 will be evaluated,
              and one multi-cell stack of capacity 200 W will be built and evaluated to gain
              experience at the level of a large cell stack performance, and other important
              issues such as effectiveness of manifolding, thermal and water management.  As
              the final outcome of this project, one 1 kW fuel cell stack will be designed
              and evaluated.  The anticipated results include the availability of developed
              technology for a high performance, simplified PEM fuel cell at substantial
              savings of the amount of electrolyte material, and a low cost alternative
              energy source.  The PEM fuel cell will be most suitable for use in electric
              vehicles.  The fuel cell will be equally suitable as a power source for use in
              homes, various industries, defense applications, and space missions.  As a
              standby power source the fuel cell will be useful for the utility and remote
              site operations.  The proposed project will make the fuel cell simplified and
              cost effective- important criteria for commerc ial viability.  ***
