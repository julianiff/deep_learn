Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:   CTS-9631352     Principal Investigator:  Johari  
                This is grant to support a collaborative effort between Worcester Polytechnic
              Institute and Physical Sciences Inc. to investigate the concept of vortex
              generator jets for turbulent boundary layer control.  Detailed flow
              visualization experiments will be performed to probe the near field of a pulsed
              vortex generator jet embedded in a turbulent boundary layer.  Studies will be
              made in both a water tunnel and a wind tunnel.  Data obtained from this study
              will be used to model the interaction of the pulsing jet and the boundary layer
              flow.  Information  of this type will be useful in developing improved boundary
              layer control systems with a variety of applications including flow control on
              airliner wings.  The project will utilize experimental facilities at Physical
              Sciences and WPI.   This research has the potential to significantly enhance
              the performance of jet injection vortex generators in comparison to
              conventional vane generators that have inherently higher parasite drag. The
              concept is quite important to the success of MEMS technology. The blending of
              the academic and industrial research facilities greatly enhances the overall
              capability for carrying  out the proposed research.  This project will be cost
              shared with Physical Sciences Inc. under the GOALI program.
