Abstract    :
              Wright  9631316    Search theory provides a new way to think about many issues
              in monetary economics.  This project contributes to the foundations of monetary
              economics by extending in several directions some recent development in the
              literature that use search theory to formalize the role of money and related
              assets in the economy.  The major recent development in this literature has
              been the use of bargaining theory to determine prices endogenously in the
              models, while previous versions more or less assumed that prices were fixed
              exogenously in order t focus on the process of trade (who exchanges with whom,
              using which objects as media of exchange, and so on).  In terms of methods, the
              current proposal has three parts.  First, it is argued that by using a simple
              special case of bargaining theory, one may derive such stronger results and one
              may therefore use the model to address more complicated questions than would
              have been possible in general.  Second, it is suggested that there is
              potentially interesting new way to analyze government policy in these models. 
              Finally, there are several technical or mathematical issues that need to be
              addressed.  This research should eventually contribute to the analysis of
              currency reform, e.g., what are the costs and benefits of European currency
              integration.
