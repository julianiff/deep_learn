Abstract    :
              One goal of this research is to study model selection in ARMA  models by
              utilizing parametric and non-parametric fits of the  spectral density function.
               A measure of discrepancy is to be  developed which compares directly the
              parametric estimate in the  ARMA model with a kernel non-parametric estimator
              of the spectral  density,  as opposed to fitting the model and then looking at 
              spectrum estimates involving the residuals.  The particular  nonparametric
              estimator to be used is a Gasser-Muller   estimator which applies kernel
              weights to the periodogram and  utilizes a local bandwidth choice.  Optimal
              bandwidth choices for  this estimator will be addressed. Theoretical properties
              will  be obtained for the selection method, and performance of this  criteria
              will be assessed by comparisons with current methods as  well as extensive
              simulation studies.    Another goal is the collaboration with a colleague,
              Jeping He, in  the Bioengineering Department at Arizona State University.  He 
              has a significant amount of data on a project entitled:  "Adaptation in Posture
              and Muscle Tone in Anticipation of  Perturbation" which appears to be
              nonstationary time series data  but shows segments of stationarity.  We then
              have the opportunity  to use standard techniques in analyzing the segments
              including  those developed in the previous paragraph.  In addition we hope  to
              develop new techniques for analyzing similar nonstationary  data using, for
              example, the evolutionary spectrum.
