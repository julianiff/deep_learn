Abstract    :
                9631642    This award supports a consortium of three laboratories located at 
              Stanford University, U.C. Berkley, and University of Pennsylvania. The  long
              term goal of this project is to determine the total DNA sequence  of the
              Arabidopsis thaliana genome. For the next three years, the  specific goal of
              this consortium is to produce at least 5.2 Mb of  finished sequences of DNA
              from chromosome 1. Additional important goal  of this project is to apply the
              new high throughput DNA sequencing  technologies to Arabidopsis genome
              sequencing. All sequences will be  deposited in GenBank upon completion of each
              BAC or YAC clones.  Unfinished sequence data will be made available on a WWW
              site to be set  up at Stanford. Clones and other materials will be made
              available  through the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio State.   
              This award is one of the three awarded by the triagency (Department of  Energy,
              National Science Foundation, and US Department of Agriculture)  Arabidopsis
              thaliana genome research program. The activity of this  consortium will be
              coordinated with the other groups engaged in large  scale sequencing of the
              Arabidopsis genome. The results will contribute  to determining the overall
              strategy for the completion of the sequence  of the entire Arabidopsis genome.
              More importantly, the information and  data produced will be useful to the
              general research community and will  contribute to a rapid advance in plant
              biology.
