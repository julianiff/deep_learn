Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9631916    Principal Investigator:  Charles
              Falco/University of Arizona    Title:  Advanced Multilayer Coatings in the
              Extreme Ultraviolet      Abstract    This research will develop techniques for
              producing new kinds of multilayer mirrors suitable for several applications in
              the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelength region: projection lithography, soft
              x-ray microscopy, astronomy and lasers.  The approach involves mirror formation
              by layer-by layer molecular beam epitaxy of materials combinations which is a
              substantial departure from the use of diffractive optics/zone plates. 
              Interface roughness is the central problem for these short-wavelength
              multilayers; therefore emphasis is placed on characterizing and controlling
              roughness. transmission electron microscopy scanning tunneling microscopy
              atomic force microscopy and low angle x-ray diffraction experiments are planned
              to study how the interface roughness evolves from the substrate up through the
              multilayers.  Reflectance high-energy electron diffraction and low-energy
              diffraction will be used in-situ to study the roughness evolution for the
              MBE-grown samples.  Development of the multilayer mirror technique is a very
              flexible approach , which can be implemented widely for many applications.
