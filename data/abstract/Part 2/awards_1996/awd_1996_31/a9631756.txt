Abstract    :
              9631756  Cline  During the Development of the nervous system, neurons growth
              processes and form synaptic connections.  These two events, process outgrowth
              and synapse formation may be controlled by the electrical activity in the
              neurons.  We propose to examine the influence of synaptic activity on the
              development of neuronal growth and the formation of synaptic connections in the
              developing visual system of the frog.  This system has been used extensively to
              study the influence of neuronal activity on the development of the brain.  We
              can now label single tectal neurons in the intact animal and observe their
              morphological development for up to five days by taking time-lapse confocal
              images.  In addition, we have developed a preparation in which we can record
              the synaptic connections from developing neurons.  Results from the proposed
              experiments on brain development will be integrated with tour previous results
              on the dynamic actvity-dependent growth of retinal axons to provide a more
              comprehensive understanding of the development of a neuronal circuit in the
              intact brain.
