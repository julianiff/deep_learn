Abstract    :
              CTS - 9631202  William Koros  U of Texas Austin      ABSTRACT      The GOALI
              project deals with characterization of hollow fiber membranes prior to
              downstream processing.  The objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of
              using aqueous based dyes to evaluate the surface porosity of polymeric fibers. 
              Dye uptake measurements will be correlated with O2/N2 permeation data to
              determine if the technique can be used during processing to predict final fiber
              properties.  A graduate student will be supported to perform the research in an
              industrial location.  Potential applications of the technique include
              industrial fiber production, separations and characterization of porous
              surfaces in general.
