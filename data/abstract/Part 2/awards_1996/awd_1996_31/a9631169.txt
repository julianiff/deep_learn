Abstract    :
              9631169  Filipowski   This GOALI project supports a faculty-student team working
              with engineers from the Collins Avionics and Communications Division of
              Rockwell International Corporation to develop a system for accurately and
              quickly predicting required labor hours for a new project.  Predicted labor
              hours are part of a work measurement system, and are used to plan, schedule,
              budget, establish cost estimates, and measure an employee's performance. 
              Inaccurate prediction can lead to increased costs and decreased productivity. 
              Current labor hour prediction often involves complicated procedures that are
              expensive and time-consuming.  This project will develop simple and efficient
              methods for predicting required project labor hours that use historical
              estimates of normal and standard times for similar projects, as well as
              allowances for project complexity, manufacturing inefficiencies, learning, and
              labor performance.  Two systems will be developed, one to provide quotes of
              acceptable accuracy within an hour or less, and another to provide more
              accurate quotes within a day or less.       The results from this project can
              be used to improve customer serviceability by providing quick and accurate
              quotes for new product development costs.  As part of an overall budgeting
              system, they will also be useful in operational planning, budgeting, and
              cost-control.
