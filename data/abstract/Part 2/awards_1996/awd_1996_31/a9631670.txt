Abstract    :
              9631670  Wu  This project should lead to a fundamental understanding of  the
              marrow microenvironment, the role of neurotransmitters,  and the genes and
              molecules regulating hemopoiesis and  lymphopoiesis.  The information obtained
              will be used to  formulate strategies for engineering ex vivo bone marrow 
              mimicry.  It will ultimately lead to a novel bone marrow  technology for
              clinical applications in treating  hematological disorders.  Moreover, design
              of a bone marrow  bioreactor based on this information should be an extremely 
              valuable tool for further delineating the hemopoietic  microenvironment, and
              for examining drug efficacy, toxicity,  and pathogenicity.  ***
