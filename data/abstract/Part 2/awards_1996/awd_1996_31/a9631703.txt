              Zimmerman    Experiments  during  the last decade on the  flow  of  superfluid 
              liquid 4He through micron and submicron size apertures have given  new  insight
              into the first appearance of dissipation in the flow  at  the  critical
              velocity. In particular, discrete  "phase-slip"  events  have  been identified
              which are thought to represent  the  creation  and  evolution  of  single 
              quantum  vortices  in   the  superfluid.  The present work is intended to
              supply some  of  the  additional information needed to test models of the
              creation  and  evolution processes. Further, it will study the transition  to 
              a  different  type of critical velocity behavior that is customarily  observed 
              in  apertures  and tubes appreciably  larger  than  one  micron in diameter. 
              %%%  This  work  is  directed at understanding  the  fundamental  flow 
              properties  of  superfluid  liquid  helium.  The  study  requires  temperatures
               near  absolute zero, where physical  systems  often  show  simpler and
              sometimes unusual properties. In  the  case  of  liquid  helium,  its  purity 
              and molecular  simplicity  and  the  appearance of a remarkable degree of order
              in its flow have  made  it  a  superb  system  for testing fundamental  ideas 
              about  the  properties  and  behavior of fluids. The present studies  concern 
              the first appearance of disorder in the flow and the accompanying  dissipation 
              of  energy  as the velocity  is  increased  above  a  certain  level, phenomena
              analogous to the onset of instabilities  and  turbulence in the flow of
              ordinary fluids. An integral  part  of this work is the training of graduate
              students in physics in a  broad range of experimental and research skills.  ***
