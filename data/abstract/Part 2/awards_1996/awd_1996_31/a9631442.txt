Abstract    :
              9631442  Wolpert  Victoria blight of oats is caused by the fungus Cochliobolus
              victoriae.  This fungus is pathogenic because it produces the host-specific
              toxin, victorin.  In the host, sensitivity to victorin, and thus,
              susceptibility to the pathogen, is conditioned by the dominant allele at the Vb
              locus.  It has been hypothesized that the Vb gene conditions susceptibility by
              coding for a toxin "receptor" (site of action) which is functional in
              toxin-sensitive lines (susceptible lines) and either absent or altered in
              toxin-insensitive lines.  Biologically-active, labeled derivatives of the toxin
              have been used to identify and 100 kDa protein that binds victorin only in
              toxin-sensitive (susceptible) genotypes of oats and a 15 kDa protein that binds
              victorin in both susceptible and resistant genotypes.  The 100 kDa
              victorin-binding protein (VBP) has been identified as the P-protein component
              of the nuclear-encoded, mitochondrial multienzyme complex, glycine
              decarboxylase.  Results have also indicated that the 15 kDa H-protein component
              of the glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC) is a VBP.      This research will
              test a biochemical model that toxin specificity is regulated by the interaction
              of the two victorin binding proteins, the P- and the H-protein components of
              the GDC.  The results will provide new information about the nature of
              Host-specific toxin dependent plant disease, which may lead to a new crop
              protection strategy.
