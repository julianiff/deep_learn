              Abstract  ATM-9631673  Porter, Stephen C.  University of Washington  Title: High
              Resolution Paleomonsoon Records from Central China    The Loess Plateau of
              central China contains a nearly continuous  record of paleoenvironmental change
              spanning the last 2.5 million  years.  Studies over the past two decades have
              described and  attempted to date the long loess/paleosol sequence that mantles
              the  plateau, but only during the past several years has attention been 
              directed toward obtaining high-resolution time-series of the last 
              glacial/interglacial cycle in order to understand the factors that  influenced
              the East Asian Monsoon system during the late  Quaternary.  This award supports
              a paleoclimate investigation in  the climatically sensitive boundary zone
              between arid and semi-arid  climates of central China where the changing
              monsoon effects are  pronounced and well documented in sedimentary strata. 
              Sampling of  loess/paleosol profiles along the desert margin will help to
              assess  temporal and regional variations in winter monsoon strength during  the
              last glacial cycle and the Holocene.  Data derived from this  study also will
              be relevant to addressing problems of erosion,  decertification, natural
              resource exploitation, and agricultural  productivity in the densely inhabited
              transition zone between arid  and semi-humid climates.
