Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funding to conduct a pilot study to establish the
              operational feasibility of an International Regimes Database (IRD), a large
              scale computerized information system under development in cooperation with
              IIASA (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis).   This database
              will allow analysts to conduct systematic quantitative and qualitative studies
              answering a wide range of questions about the role of international regimes in
              environmental issue areas.  Ultimately, the generalization of this database
              will allow social scientists to formulate answers to major questions about
              international regimes:  Do they matter?  What conditions control the formation
              of regimes?  Why are some regimes more effective than others?       The project
              staff will create both paper and computerized data forms as well as instruction
              guidelines for the use of the protocol codes.  Twelve to 24 cases will be coded
              during the grant period.  This project falls within the scope of the Human
              Dimensions of Global Change initiative.  It will be jointly funded by the a
              grant from the TransCoop Program of the German-American Academic Council
              Foundation.
