Abstract    :
              9631511  Gilly    Research on the giant axon system of the squid during the 
              past 50 years has provided the foundation for our  understanding of 
              communication within and between neurons -  nerve impulse conduction and
              synaptic transmission.  The  basic mechanisms governing these processes are
              shared by all  organisms with nervous systems, from jellyfish to humans.  Much
              remains to be learned about the dynamic interactions  that occur between
              individual nerve and muscle cells and how  these interactions change during the
              acquisition of new  behaviors.  Background work indicates that giant and non- 
              giant motor systems in squid can act independently to  achieve a large range of
              jet velocities or, in close  concert, to achieve super-charged jetting. 
              Experiments  funded by this grant are designed to examine the  interactions
              between these two motor systems during escape  behavior and to describe changes
              in these interactions that  occur shortly after hatching.  Preliminary work has
              shown  that these developmental changes are strongly linked to the 
              experience-dependent acquisition of prey capture behavior.    It is expected
              that this work will provide new insights into  how activity of specific motor
              nerve cells is coordinated by  the brain to produce complex behavioral outputs
              and how  development of this motor coordination is influenced by  experiences
              early in life.
