Abstract    :
              9631175  HEBERT  This project will examine turbulent mixing on Georges Bank as
              part  of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Studies, Phase 2  program.
              Research will be conducted to determine if there are  relationships between
              turbulence and predator/prey distributions  in the context that turbulence
              levels affect the patchiness of  prey and predators. Three different objectives
              will be pursued:  1) to investigate the processes and dynamics responsible for
              the  vertical structure of mixing rates; 2) to determine bottom stress  at each
              location and formulate a parameterization to explain the  variability of the
              stress; and 3) to define the relationships  between biological patchiness and
              turbulent mixing rates.  ***
