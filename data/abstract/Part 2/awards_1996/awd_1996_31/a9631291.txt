              Abstract  ATM-9631291  Jordan, Teresa  Cornell University  Title: Collaborative
              Research: Andean Climate History: Geochemical  Proxies from a Holocene
              Pleistocene Salt Core, Salar Del Hombre  Muerto, Argentina    This award
              supports a paleoenvironmental study of a 50+meter salt  core from Hombre Muerto
              salar, a dry lake in the southeastern  Altiplano/Puna plateau of the Central
              Andes.  The core is a  register of the history of fill and desiccation of the
              lake, and is  thus a record of the changes in hydrology and climate extending 
              back through time.  In South America, the climate history of the  Last Glacial
              Maximum and the Holocene is controversial, and prior  to the Quaternary, it is
              virtually unknown.  Paleoclimate data  extracted from this core will address
              the relative timing of  northern and southern hemisphere climate cycles, and
              the temporal  phase relations between precipitation cycles and temperature
              cycles  in the Andes.
