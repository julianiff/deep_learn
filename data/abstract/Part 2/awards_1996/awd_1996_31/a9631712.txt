Abstract    :
              Alberto J. Trejos  Northwestern University  SBR-9631712    This research will
              undertake three monetary search theory related  projects.  The first project
              will examine the purchasing power of  money and the determination of exchange
              rates for countries whose  currency circulates abroad.  The second project will
              study the  strategic interaction between a group of central banks, where  each
              has to decide a monetary policy.  The decisions of the  central banks are
              linked by the common realm of circulation of  their currencies.  The third
              project will undertake exploratory  research on a computable search model with
              divisible money.
