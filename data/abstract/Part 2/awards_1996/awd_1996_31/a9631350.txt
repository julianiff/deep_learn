Abstract    :
              Wingfield  9631350    The environmental factors, such as daylength, temperature
              and  humidity, play an important role in the regulation of reproductive 
              success in animals in the wild.  These factors affect neural and  endocrine
              function that facilitate adaptive behaviors of animals to  their environment. 
              Dr. Wingfield is conducting laboratory and  field studies to determine how
              environmental signals interact with  social cues to regulate neuroendocrine and
              endocrine secretions  that orchestrate reproductive development and success.  
              Identification of sensory modalities and neural pathways by which 
              environmental information impinges upon the brain are also under 
              investigation.  These studies represent a highly integrated blend  of field
              investigations coupled with mathematical treatment of  natural history data
              that will then interface directly with  physiological, cell and molecular
              mechanisms.  The results will  provide crucial new information on how organisms
              interpret  environmental information which in turn could have practical 
              application as to how animals, particularly vertebrates, may  respond to global
              change in the near future.
