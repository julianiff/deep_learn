Abstract    :
              Over the past century scholars have commented on the incursion of organized
              political interests into the judicial process.  Based on this work, we have
              accumulated a good deal of descriptive data about the type and frequency of
              interest group participation in judicial proceedings.  Most of the existing
              research, however, is not theoretically informed but rather largely descriptive
              and idiographic.  The largest barrier to the development of
              theoretically-oriented work is the lack of uniform, systematic, and
              comprehensive data, a failing this project intends to remedy.  This
              collaborative project will create a multi-user database on the participation of
              organized interests as amici curiae ("friends of the court") in federal
              appellate courts and in state courts of last resort.  For all cases containing
              at least one amicus curiae brief, the database will house information on the
              identity of the amici, their reasons for participating, and the position they
              urged the court to adopt.  This database will be linked to existing databases
              including, the NSF-supported U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Courts of Appeals
              Databases.  The database will be updated annually by the investigators.
