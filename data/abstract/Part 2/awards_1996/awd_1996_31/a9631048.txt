Abstract    :
              9631048  Hays  An understanding of mutagenic and antimutagenic processes in
              plants will be enhanced by knowing the baseline rates of somatic mutation,
              before modulation by any internal selection process and by understanding more
              about how plant genome-fidelity activities reduce mutational loads. Those
              insights will be gained by developing in Arabidopsis thaliana a versatile
              somatic-mutation assay system, based on reversion of reporter-gene alleles, by
              initiating searches for Arabidopsis "mutator" mutants, by isolating and
              analyzing plant mismatch-repair genes, and by beginning to study the effects of
              UV mutation and mismatch-repair on recombination in Arabidopsis.  %%%  The
              fixed locations, obligatory exposure to sunlight and oxygen-producing
              metabolism subject plants to a variety of environmental mutagens. Nevertheless,
              estimated somatic mutation frequencies in trees and annuals do not suggest
              ongoing error catastrophes. Thus, plants may employ unusually powerful
              genome-fidelity functions. This study will begin to investigate those
              mechanisms.  ***
