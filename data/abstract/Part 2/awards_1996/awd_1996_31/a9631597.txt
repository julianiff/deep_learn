Abstract    :
              9631597  Bohs  This proposal involves the development and support of student 
              projects to aid the disabled, to be undertaken within the  framework of a new
              course in the Biomedical Engineering  Department at Duke University.  The
              objectives of the proposed  projects are to enhance engineering education,
              provide students  with insight into careers in working with the disabled, to 
              improve the quality of life of people with disabilities, and to  serve the
              community.  Students will be paired with health care  professionals who will
              suggest assistive or therapeutic  technologies to develop for a specific user
              or group.  The  student, health care professional and course instructor will 
              formulate a plan for implementation with the goal of producing a  completed
              project that meets the need of the disabled person, as  well as providing a
              challenging design experience for the  student.  Five or six projects are
              expected to be completed each  year, involving students working individually or
              as small teams.  In addition to project development, the course will involve 
              formal lectures on topics such as engineering design and ethics,  as well as
              numerous student presentations and written reports.  ***
