Abstract    :
              9631289  Brower    The incidence of completed suicide in adolescents and young
              adults, age 15-24 more than tripled between 1957 and 1989.  Suicide ideation is
              common with as many as 60 percent of adolescents reporting they have thought
              about suicide.  Suicide attempts by adolescents are reliably associated with
              depression, mood variability and impulsivity.  Research on "self concept"
              explains mood variability and impulsive behavior and links them to suicide
              ideation and attempts.  In this Dissertation Improvement research, adolescent
              suicide ideators (SI) and suicide attempters (SA) are hypothesized to be two
              distinct groups with different cognitive structures of self concept.  Assessing
              the different aspects of self concept will not only enable us to distinguish SI
              adolescents from SA adolescents but also help identify youth most at risk for
              suicide attempts.  The convenience sample for this study consists of 120
              adolescents, age 14-16, recruited voluntary from a pool of inpatients and
              outpatients who receive mental health services through a number of mental
              health providers in Dane County and the City of Milwaukee.  Demographic data
              will be collected as well as information from several tests given to
              participants to measure levels of impulsivity, suicide ideation and threats,
              and depression.   ***   ??
