Abstract    :
              9631153  Bustamante  This application describes a series of experiments designed
               to investigate the response of DNA, proteins, and their  complexes when
              subjected to mechanical stress.  These  studies are a continuation of previous
              effects by this  laboratory to employ methods such as Optical Tweezers and 
              Scanning Force Microscopy (SFM) to investigate the  mechanical response of
              single molecules.  The proposed  studies are divided into three main groups: 
              i) Studies of  the elastic response of single dsDNA molecules; ii) Studies  of
              the elastic response of RecA-DNA filaments; and iii)  Studies of the mechanical
              denaturation of single molecules  of T4 lysozyme and titin.  %%%  The results
              of these studies will provide completely new  insights into the nature and
              magnitude of the intramolecular  forces that hold together biological
              structures.  In fact,  previously published work on the elasticity of single
              dsDNA  molecules has already resulted in the characterization of  three
              distinctive regimes of DNA elasticity.  These three  regimes are likely to play
              different roles in the process of  recombination in vivo.  The experiments
              proposed here will  extend these studies to directly investigate the mechanical
               properties of the recombinant filaments and the denaturation  of single
              protein molecules.  ***
