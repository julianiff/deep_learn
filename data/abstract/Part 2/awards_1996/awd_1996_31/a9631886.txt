Abstract    :
              Girls RISE (Raising Interest in Science & Engineering) is a model  program that
              will showcase how an informal, non-competitive  learning environment that
              includes hands-on, reality-based  applications of engineering principles and
              teamwork, can build  confidence and encourage girls to develop an interest in
              science,  engineering and mathematics and related careers.  Project  objectives
              are:  (1) to build competent, confident, enthusiastic  learners equipped with
              an array of advanced computer and technology  skills; (2) to expose girls to a
              variety of engineering careers  through interaction with professional women
              employed in science and  engineering related fields; (3) to increase girls
              confidence in  their ability to perform in traditionally male dominated
              technical  and engineering arenas while improving their problem solving and 
              information processing skills; (4) to foster sustained  participation in
              engineering-related studies, reducing the  attrition that occurs as girls move
              from the middle school to the  high school level.    The project builds upon
              the work the Miami Museum of Science  conducted with under-represented youth,
              and includes several key  components that have proven successful in related
              projects.  These  include:  the acquisition of advanced computer skills; the
              use of  college level mentors as instructors; interaction with  professionals
              in their workplace; project based, active learning;  and paid internships.
