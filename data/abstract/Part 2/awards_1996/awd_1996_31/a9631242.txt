Abstract    :
              This program is addressing the lack of participation in science, engineering,
              and math endeavors  by rural middle school girls, and should serve as a model
              for programs in rural settings  throughout the nation.    It will provide rural
              Mississippi girls with hands-on experiences with computer hardware and 
              software, a nurturing environmental in which to build problem-solving skills, a
              network of other  girls interested in SEM studies, and exposure to a variety of
              female role models who are  pursuing SEM careers.  Program activities feature
              an intensive weeklong stay on the University  of Mississippi campus; monthly
              programs at the girls  schools continuing through the school  year; electronic
              mentoring form university women in computer science, and a capstone weekend 
              back on campus.  A complementary program for teachers will emphasize the need
              for gender  equity in science and math teaching; and establishing a support
              network of middle school  teachers and university faculty committed to
              inspiring girls to succeed at SEM    Major program goals are that: 
              participants will understand SEM concepts, and develop  improved critical
              thinking abilities and problem-solving skills through cooperative, discovery- 
              oriented activities, participants will gain self confidence in their science
              and mathematics abilities  and their overall competence, participants will be
              motivated to participate fully in science,  engineering and mathematics
              education and to consider SEM careers, and teachers will develop  contacts, and
              revitalize and recommit their efforts to promote gender equity in SEM at their 
              schools    Significant spill-over effects should be expected on other groups: 
              teachers who participate along  with the girls; families of girls involved in
              the program, and other girls at the participating  schools.
