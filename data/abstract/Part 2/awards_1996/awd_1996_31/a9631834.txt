Abstract    :
              9631834  Marchand  The PI proposes to hold a workshop on the topic of wavelength
               division multiplexing (WDM) in free space optical systems,  particularly
              processing systems that use smart pixel as the  processing element and optics
              for the interconnection.  The goal of  the workshop is to bring together
              members of the scientific and  engineering community that work in systems and
              device related areas  such as free space optical systems, smart pixels,
              optoelectronic  devices, and wavelength division multiplexing to discuss and
              access  the potential impact of WDM on free space optical architecture and 
              related applications.  ***
