Abstract    :
              S. Shen    9631982        Changes in ionic activities, especially intracellular
              calcium activity ( Ca2+ i), have been linked to a wide variety of signal
              transduction pathways mediating the actions of growth factors, hormones and
              other extrinsic ligands. A model cell system for studying ionic events is the
              fertilization reaction in sea urchin eggs. Changes in ionic activities in the
              sea urchin egg during fertilization are necessary and sufficient for activation
              of the developmental program. Central to the ionic changes is a transient rise
              in  Ca2+  i, which has been extensively characterized. The egg is similar to
              many somatic cells by having both conventional Ca2+ release mechanisms, that
              are sensitive to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and ryanodine. The egg also
              contains a recently discovered novel Ca2+ release that is induced by nicotinate
              adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). Despite the significance of the rise in
               Ca2+ i during fertilization, how the response is triggered by the sperm is
              still unknown. Based on pharmacological studies, the two conventional Ca2+
              release mechanisms were considered to be redundant for triggering the
              fertilization response. But more recent pharmacological studies suggest that
              the IP3 receptor Ca2+ channel is the primary and required mechanism for Ca2+
              release during fertilization, rather than equal redundant mechanisms. As with
              all pharmacological studies, the conclusion is limited by the specificity of
              the agents utilized. The objective of this proposal is to define the required
              mechanism(s) for the rise in  Ca2+  i during fertilization. The experiments in
              this proposal are designed to establish the significance of inositol
              phospholipid hydrolysis during fertilization. Rather than block the activity of
              IP3 receptor Ca2+ channel, the requirement of IP3 production will be directly
              assessed by inhibiting inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. The significance of
              IP3 production is also evaluated indirectly by further characterization of the
              ryanodine and NAADP Ca 2+ release mechanisms.
