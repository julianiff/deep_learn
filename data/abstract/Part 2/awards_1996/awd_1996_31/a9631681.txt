Abstract    :
              9631681  Jensen    This Americas Program award will support collaborative 
              research between Dr. Richard G. Jensen of the University of  Arizona and Drs.
              Omar Pantoja and Bronwyn Barkla of the  Instituto de Biotecnologia of the
              Universidad Nacional  Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) in Cuernavaca, Mexico. The 
              objective of this project is to focus on the biochemical and  regulatory uptake
              of sodium through potassium channels of  halophytic plants.    The two research
              groups share an interest in higher plant  salinity tolerance, and in comparing
              mechanisms identified  in the halophyte Mesembryanthemum crystallinum (ice
              plant)  with corresponding mechanisms in glycophytes. They plan to 
              characterize the AKT/KAT and HKT transcript complement in  the ice plant; study
              cell-tissue development and stress  specific expression of genes; characterize
              the  channel/transporter proteins expressed in suspension culture  cells and in
              Xenopus oocytes; and investigate protein  responses to external stimuli and
              pharmacological agents.  The joint work will be complementary and offer an 
              opportunity for students and researchers to explore concepts  and techniques
              relevant to each laboratory.  ***
