Abstract    :
              9631665  Atema    The mechanisms by which animals detect objects by their  sense
              of smell are largely unknown.  In natural settings  odor plumes are broken up
              by turbulence into many  discontinuous odor patches, hence locating an odor
              source is  a very hard problem.  Computational approaches, using  artificial
              neural nets have proven highly effective in  recognizing complex patterns. 
              Although most studies of  animal pattern recognition are based on visual or
              acoustic  inputs, the research funded this grant is focused on  recognition of
              temporal odor patterns.  It is proposed that  the rapid concentration
              fluctuations that animals encounter  in turbulent odor plumes contain spatial
              information and  that animals use such dynamic patterns to guide them to the 
              source of the odor.  The computational research funded by  this grant explores
              candidate search strategies for such  gradients and tests these strategies
              under various plume  conditions.    In addition to increasing our understanding
              of how animals  use their olfactory systems, the results obtained by this 
              study are expected to be applicable to robot guidance in  underwater search
              missions, such as locating sources of  pollution in the natural environment.
