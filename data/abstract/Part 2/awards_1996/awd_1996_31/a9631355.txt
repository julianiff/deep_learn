Abstract    :
              9631355  Grodzicker      Computational Neuroscience represents a timely approach
              to  viewing the nervous systems of animals.  Such computational  approaches to
              neuroscience have generated many important  advances in our understanding of
              nervous system function.  This grant provides fund for a 2-week course at the
              Cold  Spring Harbor Laboratory.  Through a combination of lectures  and
              hands-on experience in a computer laboratory this course  presents current
              concepts in feature extraction, motion  analysis binocular stereopsis, color
              vision, higher level  visual processing and visual neuronal networks.  The 
              underlying theme of the course is that an understanding of  computational
              problems together with the constraints on  solutions provide necessary help in
              the guidance of research  in neuroscience.
