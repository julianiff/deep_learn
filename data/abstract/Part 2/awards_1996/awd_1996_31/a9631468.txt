Abstract    :
              9631468  WIEBE  This project is part of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field
               Studies, Phase 2 program and  provides the program services and  data
              management necessary to conduct this large multi--  disciplinary multi-PI
              program. The Program Service and Data  Management Office is responsible for
              providing basic services,  logistical support, and data management required by
              scientific  investigators as they conduct their field research, analyze the 
              data from their individual efforts, and integrate these results  with the
              various research components of the GLOBEC program.  During the research period
              the office will: 1) manage several data  sets (CTD, biomass, meteorological,
              satellite, model, etc.) and  make these data available via an on-line, World
              Wide Web based,  data management system; 2) work with principal investigators
              on  quality control; maintain an inventory and program thesaurus;  support
              field operations; 3) distribute program documentation  including cruise and
              data reports as well as data acquisition  procedures and protocols; 4) ensure
              final submission of data to a  national data archive center; and 5) facilitate
              national and  international exchanges of data and program-related information.
