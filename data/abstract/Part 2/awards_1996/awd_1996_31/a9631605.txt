Abstract    :
              Dr.  Karen Goldberg, Department of Chemistry, University of Washington,   is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program   of the
              Chemistry Division under a Career Advancement Award to study the   energetics
              and mechanisms of reductive elimination reactions from Pt(IV)   metal centers.
              Reductive elimination is a fundamental reaction step in   organometallic
              chemistry occurring as the product release step in   homogeneous catalytic
              processes. The goal of this project is to gain a   general and practical
              understanding of the controlling factors of   reductive elimination and to
              develop predictive capabilities of   reactivity applicable to a wide variety of
              substituents.  This work will   advance Dr. Goldberg's career by providing a
              basis for preparing a   competitive NSF research proposal subsequent to the
              completion of this   Career Advancement Award.  Catalytic reactions involving
              metal ions such as platinum and palladium   are common in organic synthesis and
              provide for the formation of   carbon-carbon bonds, for example.  These
              reactions require that organic   fragments first add to the metal complex, then
              react in some fashion,   followed by release of a functionalized molecule.  The
              release step,   known as reductive elimination, is of fundamental importance,
              yet the   factors affecting it are not well understood.  Systematic studies of
              this   step will be performed to gain a fundamental understanding of the  
              mechanism of this process, and to enhance the ability to predict the   outcomes
              of these reactions.
