Abstract    :
              PROJECT SUMMARY       This award will establish the infrastructure of a new
              interdisciplinary group to tackle questions concerning systems of nonlinear
              oscillators and their applications in biology and engineering.  The senior
              scientists involved form a focused, multi-disciplinary team consisting of
              applied mathematicians, neuroscientists, biomedical engineers, and mechanical
              engineers.  Each team member has extensive experience studying systems of
              coupled oscillators, with fields of expertise including nonlinear dynamical
              systems, nonlinear control, animal locomotion, robotics, fluid mechanics,
              neurophysiological oscillators, circuit models, asymptotic analysis, and
              partial differential equations.  Moreover, the mathematical modeling continues
              to be closely intertwined with experiments.     This new group was formed to
              conduct research in three classes of coupled oscillator systems: neural,
              mechanical, and neuro-mechanical.  The specific questions addressed for each
              class aim at understanding coupling-induced phenomena-such as synchronization,
              energy transfer, localization, resonant mode coupling, oscillatory control, and
              chaotic oscillations.  In addition, the specific problems arise in a variety of
              applications: memory and learning, control of chains, strings and shafts,
              compressors, interacting gas bubbles, robotics, quadruped motion, fish
              swimming, and salamander locomotion.     Funds will provide training in
              interdisciplinary research for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students.  A
              well-publicized seminar series will occur each year.  Finally, technology
              transfer will be fostered by a technical report series and direct discussion
              with industrial collaborators.
