              NSF Proposal:    ATM-9631219  Title:    "Open-path FTIR Measurement of Biomass
              Burning Emissions"     PI: Robert Yokelson, University of Montana, Department
              of Chemistry      Abstract      Biomass burning injects significant amounts of
              trace gases into the regional and global atmosphere.  Most of the chemical
              species emitted by biomass fires are sufficiently reactive and are not
              well-mixed in the atmosphere.  In addition, fire emissions and
              emissions-processing of smoke plumes vary considerably at different stages of
              biomass combustion within a single fire event, and also, for distinct types of
              biomass vegetation.    This project focuses on emissions characterization of
              smoke using an open path fourier transform infrared instrument (OP-FTIR) to
              measure trace gas chemical species.  The OP-FTIR  spectroscopic instrument will
              operate in the fire research laboratory at the University of Montana and will
              measure gaseous products from fuel-specific biomass fires.  The instrument will
              be modified and tested for deployment on aircraft platforms and for
              ground-based studies of  large-scale biomass fires.  The OP-FTIR spectroscopic
              measurement technique will improve emissions estimates of trace gases due to
              biomass fires, and will expand the range of chemical compounds that are
              identified and measured in smoke.  ATM-9631219
