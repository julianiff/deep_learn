Abstract    :
                A team of collaborators from seven bioinformatics research  organizations
              proposes to enhance existing software tools to  create a World Wide Web (WWW)
              based expert taxonomic resource  that will be immediately valuable for the
              international virology  community and will serve as a prototype for taxonomic
              data  resources in other biological disciplines. Expanding on  previously
              funded NSF project, the team will complete development  of the software
              infrastructure for providing real time access to  the International Committee
              on the Taxonomy of Viruses' database  (ICTVdB). This taxonomic knowledge base
              will combine the  advantages of local, warehoused datafiles with the ability to
               establish dynamic links to distributed forms of data and will  provide for
              immediate updating of the files. Enhancement and  modification of the DELTA
              suite of programs, used for taxonomic  research and biodiversity studies, will
              permit data analysis and  identification of organisms via the WWW. Linking of
              ICTV data  with other biological datasets, e.g., genomic data, graphics, 
              repository, and reference data via HTML and the web will enable  taxonomic
              comparisons based on genetic and phenotypic data  analysis. Use of the
              Web/Genera and Sybase software to enable SQL  queries and online data
              entry/updates over the Internet to a  relational database interoperating with
              DELTA will give  taxonomists and other researchers multiple access points and
              data  management capabilities, depending on their specific  requirements. The
              proposed data resource will conform to  prescribed standards in data modeling,
              syntax and semantics, thus  facilitating membership in the emerging
              "federation" of  biological database developers. It will also serve as a
              utility  to enhance modeling of complex biological systems.
