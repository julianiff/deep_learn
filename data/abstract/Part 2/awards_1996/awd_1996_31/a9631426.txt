Abstract    :
              Anne Beeson Royalty  Stanford University  SBR-9631426    This research will look
              at several aspects of the impact of  nonwage benefits.  Nonwage benefits
              account for approximately  one-third of total compensation.  The first part of
              the project  will investigate the effect on measured inequality of including 
              employer contributions to health insurance in measures of  earnings, as well as
              the effect on measured inequality of the  nondiscrimination provision of the
              tax code.  The second part of  the project will explore the effect of
              preferential tax treatment  for fringe benefits on the composition of
              compensation.  The last  part of the project will investigate the trade-offs
              workers make  between wages and fringes when choosing fringe benefit options.
