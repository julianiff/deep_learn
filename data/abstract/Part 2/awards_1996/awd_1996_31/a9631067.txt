Abstract    :
              9631067  Seto  These studies involve biochemical approaches to study the
              mechanism of YY1 action with particular emphasis on determining how YY1
              represses transcription.  YY1 is a mammalian sequence-specific DNA-binding
              protein with complex transcriptional properties.  In some genes YY1 activates
              transcription, in others it represses transcription and in at least one case it
              functions as part of the basal transcription complex.  Previously, a number of
              proteins have been identified that interact with YY1.  Of particular interest
              is a protein that possesses sequence homology with the yeast global
              transcriptional regulated RPD3.  The mammalian RPD3 protein is a potent
              transcriptional repressor when directed to a promoter.  These studies involve
              the functional interaction of YY1 and the mammalian RPD3 protein.  The
              hypothesis to be tested is that the negative regulation by YY1 is achieved
              through its ability to selectively interact with the conserved cellular
              protein, RPD3.  Specifically, the idea that YY1 regulates transcription by
              tethering mammalian RPD3 to DNA as a co-repressor and that this transcriptional
              mechanism is conserved from yeast to human will be tested.  With recombinant
              DNA and in vitro mutagenesis techniques, the mammalian RPD3-YY1 interaction
              will be analyzed in detail.  A number of YY1 mutants will be constructed and
              tested for their ability to associate with mammalian RPD3 and for their ability
              to modulate transcription in the presence or absence of the RPD3 protein. 
              Conversely, different mammalian RPD3 mutants will be tested for their ability
              to associate with YY1 and for their ability to modulate transcription in vivo
              and in vitro.  These studies will help answer some of the questions that are
              critical for a thorough understanding of the intricate mechanisms operating to
              orchestrate gene expression in eukaryotic cells.  ***
