Abstract    :
              9631740  Derry  This proposal was submitted to the Environmental Geochemistry &
              Biogeochemistry solicitation    NSF 96-2.  The project described below is being
              jointly supported by the Division of Earth Sciences and Environmental Biology. 
              The proposed research will address the sources, consequences, and fates of
              elements deposited to Hawaiian ecosystems.  The project will focus on
              well-characterized long substrate age gradient (LSAG) sites.  Objectives
              include:  (1) determining the atmospheric input of elements at one site on the
              LSAG, measuring wetfall, dry deposition, and cloudwater interception - all
              components of the deposition will be analyzed for major elements, strontium and
              strontium isotopes; and (2)  determining Sr isotopes in plants and soils on the
              LSAG, in lysimeters collecting water draining these sites and in streams.  The
              results, especially the strontium isotope signatures, will be used to elucidate
              the source(s) of Sr and trace its fate along the ecosystem sequence.
