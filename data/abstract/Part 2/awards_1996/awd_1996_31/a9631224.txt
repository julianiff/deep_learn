Abstract    :
              DMI-9631224    Danyluk      Chemo-mechanical polishing (CMP) chemically enhances
              removal of the surface layers of metals, oxides, and polymers in manufacturing
              large-scale integrated circuits.  It is an alternative process to reactive ion
              etching (RIE) of semiconductor device, polishing of other non-metallic systems
              such as quartz for laser windows, and silicon nitride ball bearing.  The
              university has been developing hydrodynamic models for the tribological contact
              between a polishing pad and a silicon or silicon dioxide surface, measuring
              fluid film thickness, constructing sensors for the situ measurement of wear
              rates, and developing models for the wear of silicon dioxide.   This project
              provides an opportunity for two graduate students to spend three months of
              summer in industry implementing and applying the experimental techniques and
              models to the polishing of silicon dioxide (dielectric).  This collaboration
              will lead to am improved understanding of CMP through (1) the implementation of
              models and measurement techniques developed at the university; and (2) the
              knowledge gained through industry experience and the need for production of
              consumable and CMP tools.
