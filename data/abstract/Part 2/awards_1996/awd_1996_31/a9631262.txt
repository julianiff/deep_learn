Abstract    :
              Natural resources are one factor of industrial production that, along with
              economic, geographic  and cultural factors, will shape an enterprise and
              influence its chances of success.  Entrepreneurs  may devclop a sustainable
              enterprise based on renewable or abundant resourses, or they might  follow a
              strategy that depletes a scarce local resource, or they might rely on materials
              and energy  brought in from distant sources.  Each of these choices has
              consequences for the local economy,  environment, and society.    In early
              years of the republic, entrepreneurs in the upper Housatonic River basin of
              Connecticut  chose to rely on indigenous resources, while those in the lower
              reaches of the river basin  followed a distinctly different path.  Using
              documentary and material evidence, the project will  assess the comparative
              advantages (of resources, demand for products, and connections with  related
              industries) enjoyed by entrepreneurs in these two locations, explaining how
              geographic,  physical and cultural factors influenced entrepreneurs' decisions.
