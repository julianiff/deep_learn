Abstract    :
              In business, government, and all aspects of life where planning is important,
              there  is  a need for database management systems that can handle
              `decision-support queries.`  These complex queries involve the aggregation of
              very large amounts of data.  Often, special `data warehouses,` or copies of
              information from a variety  of sources, are created for the purpose of asking
              decision-support queries, while the original databases are used for 
              transaction  processing.  Some new  database products implement `data cubes,`
              special organizations of data that facilitate common  forms  of 
              decision-support queries.  One important new research problem is data-cube
              design, where it is feasible to  materialize  a selected set of views to
              optimize average query time, for a given amount of storage.  Selection of
              materialized views for data cubes is a major research challenge.  More
              generally, when views in a warehouse are maintained as the underlying databases
              change, it  is desirable to have at the warehouse a selection of views so that
              they can all be updated without having to issue queries at the underlying 
              databases (so-called `self-maintainability` of views).  Self-maintainable
              warehouses  present  another  research challenge.  Finally,  decision-support 
              queries themselves can often be optimized by techniques recently discovered
              and, it  appears, some new techniques that need investigation.
