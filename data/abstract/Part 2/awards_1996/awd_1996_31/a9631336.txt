Abstract    :
              9631336  Touretzky    In order to navigate successfully through the world, 
              especially in the absence of visual input (e.g., in the  dark), animals must
              maintain an accurate estimate of the  direction in which they are facing.  In
              rodents, the heading  estimate is probably updated by a combination of
              vestibular  cues from the inner ear, visual cues, and information about  the
              animal's motor actions.  This award supports the  development of computer
              models of portions of the rodent  brain involved in representing head
              direction, such as the  anterior thalamic nuclei and the postsubiculum.  Based
              on  what is known about the tuning properties of head direction  cells, the
              head direction system appears to exhibit a self-  organizing activity pattern,
              called an attractor, that  shifts as the animal's heading changes.  Computer
              modeling  can reveal how this attractor system operates.    This research
              promises to yield new insights into how the  nervous system organizes animal
              behavior and how information  is represented in the mammalian brain.
