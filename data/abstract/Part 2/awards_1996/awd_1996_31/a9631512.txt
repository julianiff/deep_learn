Abstract    :
              9631512  Kumar   The objective of this research project is to determine the
              underlying microscopic mechanism of the buffing-induced reorientation of
              polymer chins in thin polyimide films of the type used for liquid crystal
              displays with the goal of providing a scientific base for designing
              improvements in the manufacturing efficiency of these displays.  This research 
              project is a collaborative effort between the Pennsylvania State University and
              IBM Research Division if Almaden Research Center.  The research collaborators
              at IBM will guide theses efforts towards direct impact on display
              manufacturing.   The research agreement between the Pennsylvania State
              University and IBM has clearly specified the roles and responsibilities of
              collaborators on both sides.  Students will gain significant experiences in
              working with industry.
