Abstract    :
                                        ABSTRACT    Experimental Analysis of Alternative Male
              Strategies    PI:  SINERVO, Barry  IBN 96-31757    Three color polymorphism s
              of males are correlated with  distinct behavioral strategies in the
              side-blotched lizard,  Uta stansburiana:  (1) orange-throated males are very 
              aggressive and defend large territories with many females,  (2) blue-throated
              males tend to be monogamous and guard  their mates, but defend small
              territories, and (3) yellow-  throated males do not defend territories, but are
              sneakers  and mimic the behaviors of females if challenged by other  males. 
              Long-term field studies indicate that the three male  types are cycling in
              frequency within the population.  Orange is replaced by yellow, yellow males
              are, in turn,  vulnerable to blue mate-guarding males,  and blue males are,  in
              turn, vulnerable to ultra-dominant orange-throated males.  It is predicted that
              each morph has a fitness advantage when  it occurs at a very low frequency. 
              Because throat color is  heritable, the initial morph frequency will be
              manipulated  in small isolated subpopulations. When offspring mature, DNA 
              paternity analysis will be used to determine the  reproductive success of each 
              male offspring in the three  experimental frequency manipulations.  In a final 
              experiment, blood testosterone concentrations will be  manipulated to determine
              if the high testosterone levels  that have been observed in orange males is
              also responsible  for both their success against blue males, and their 
              susceptibility to the yellow male strategy.
