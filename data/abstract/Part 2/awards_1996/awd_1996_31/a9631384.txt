Abstract    :
                9631384  Schmid  A GOALI award will support a cooperative study with Alcoa 
              Corporation.  The PI will use Alcoa's atomic force  microscope to perform
              microindentation and microscratch  testing of specimens while they are
              undergoing plastic  deformation.  The results will be used to validate a model 
              developed by Alcoa scientists and this model will then be  extended to treat
              friction and deformation in rolling  contact with high plastic strain rates,
              such as in cold  rolling of foil and sheet.  The collaborating scientist from 
              Alcoa will subsequently spend a semester at the PI's  institution where he will
              teach a senior design course.  ***
