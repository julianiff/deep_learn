Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  9631287    This award will provide funds for an enhanced applied
              mathematics PhD program at the University of Delaware  by incorporating an
              internship at a suitable government laboratory or industrial site.  The applied
              mathematics group at the University of Delaware is eager to develop its
              relationships with industrial contacts more fully, both to tap a rich source of
              ideas and problems and also to enhance graduate education.  With real practical
              experience in an industrial setting, graduate students will have better
              training and increased flexibility of employment.  The Principal Investigators 
              plan an industrial internship program with some key industrial contacts who
              have agreed to accept suitable interns and help develop the program.    The
              bulk of the funds to be awarded will finance enough graduate interns to allow
              the program to demonstrate its viability by establishing a reputation and
              portfolio of successful projects.  The goal is to have a vibrant and self
              sufficient program that can expand to include students from all the applied
              mathematics faculty.  This award is consistent with the GOALI activity, in that
              the funding awarded is centered on the activity of graduate students who will
              be in real industrial settings.
