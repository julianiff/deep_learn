Abstract    :
              High school girls who have completed their junior year will spend  eight weeks
              during the summer on the Iowa State University (ISU)  campus where they will
              research programming methods and develop  biological and physical science,
              engineering, and mathematics (SEM)  units for the Internet.  These units will
              be designed to get middle  school girls to explore careers in those areas.  The
              summer  research interns will be directed by a team of four female graduate 
              students who have demonstrated ability in computers, are trained in  courseware
              development, and are in SEM-related fields.  A fifth  female graduate student
              in secondary education will work as  consultant to the team to provide
              expertise in curricular content,  educational delivery, and impact on the
              targeted middle school  students.    Although the graduate women's experiences
              also will enhance their  professional development, the primary goal of
              increasing girls'  participation in SEM will be accomplished through the
              following:  developing computer Internet explorations packages that will 
              attract middle school girls to SEM; training high school girls in  the use of
              computer technology to design and develop the  explorations package, which will
              be the focus of their summer  research internship on the ISU campus; using ISU
              graduate women in  SEM to supervise the explorations package development
              process on a  daily basis, adding a special dimension to their graduate school 
              experience; working with experts in middle school education to  achieve the
              desired impact; disseminating the developed packages  through the Internet;
              publicizing these readily available, no-cost  resource packages to statewide
              education agencies through  announcements in education journals, at educator
              conferences, and  at career exploration events for middle school girls and
              community  groups like the Girl Scouts and 4-H; and advertising the project 
              and its product nationwide through notes to education-oriented  newsgroups and
              through reports at conferences on edu cation,  computers, and gender issues.
