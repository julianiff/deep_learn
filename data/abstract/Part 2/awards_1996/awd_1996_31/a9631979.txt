Abstract    :
              9631979    Briles      This laboratory has been studying the immune system of
              chickens and other birds, and has identified their erythrocyte and MHC
              alloantigen systems.  During the last grant period they genetically mapped and
              examined MHC associated fitness effects in chickens, and identified and mapped
              some of their leukocyte specific alloantigens.  In this proposal they will
              identify alloantigen systems in other captive species, including the pheasant
              and quail, as well as continue the genetic identification of the loci for the
              leukocytes specific alloantigens in the chicken.  The alloantigens will also be
              characterized biochemically.  They will examine the interaction between
              segregating alleles of these alloantigen systems and another locus that have
              identified, in the resistance or susceptibility to disease.  They also propose
              to look at these systems in other species, and this work will be done in
              collaboration with other investigators.  These studies are important for
              understanding comparative immunology, evolutionary development, and
              environmental adaptation of species.        ***
