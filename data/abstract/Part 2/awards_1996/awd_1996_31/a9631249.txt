Abstract    :
              Dr. Elisabeth Bell-Loncella, Department of Chemistry, University of  
              Pittsburgh, Johnstown, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and  
              Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division under a Research   Planning
              Grant to study nitrogenase model systems.   The role of the   driving force of
              the redox-active metal and the number of acid-labile   protons on the
              non-innocent ligand are the focus of this proposal.   Planning activities
              involve the synthesis and characterization of a   series of oxime complexes
              coupled to bis(bipyridyl)ruthenium.  The goal   is to determine the conditions
              which facilitate proton-coupled electron   transfer over a range of oxidation
              states.  The project is intended to   lay the foundation for further study of
              the synergistic transfer of   protons and electrons, and will be included as
              preliminary data in   preparation of a Faculty Research Project Proposal to be
              submitted   through the NSF's Research at Undergraduate Institutions program. 
              Nitrogenase is an important enzyme in plants which allows for the   conversion
              of molecular nitrogen to ammonia, an essential plant nutrient.    The mechanism
              of this conversion involves the simultaneous transfer of   protons and
              electrons, and metals such as ruthenium play a key role in   facilitating these
              transfer processes. Ruthenium complexes will be   synthesized and studied as
              models for this fundamental biological   process, and the factors affecting the
              transfer processes will be   determined.
