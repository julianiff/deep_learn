Abstract    :
              9631404  Karrer   DNA rearrangement is a basic biological process which occurs
              in organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals. The ciliated protozoan,
              Tetrahymena, is a particularly advantageous system in which to study such
              rearrangements because the genome undergoes thousands of site specific DNA
              rearrangements which can be synchronously induced in large numbers of cells.
              Previous work in this laboratory has resulted in the cloning and
              characterization of DNA rearrangement fragment which contains a long, 825 bp
              inverted repeat near the junctions. Such repeats are found elsewhere in the
              micronuclear genome suggesting that they   are critical to the necessary DNA
              rearrangements needed to produce the macronucleus. Cloning and structural
              analysis of additional members of the Tir family of rearrangements will be
              done; cis-acting DNA sequences necessary and sufficient for DNA rearrangements
              will be identified and tested for function by transforming Tetrahymena with DNA
              constructs containing rearrangement junctions; and the mechanism of Tir1
              rearrangement will be explored by searching for DNA intermediates.  %%% 
              Mechanisms which result in a rearrangement of DNA sequences can be more easily
              explored and understood using a single-celled model organism such as
              Tetrahymena. Such rearrangements of DNA genomes are common in organisms ranging
              from bacteria to mammals and are often developmentally controlled, as they are
              in Tetrahymena. This work will give a better understanding of the molecular
              mechanisms which can be involved.  ***
