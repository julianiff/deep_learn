Abstract    :
                   For the past three decades, the mainstream of linguistics  has focused its
              research agenda on the formal aspects of  language, primarily syntax. By
              contrast, the more recent  tradition of cognitive linguistics centers its
              research directly  within the semantic stratum of language in order to observe
              how  languages organize meaning and structure conception; and it  examines the
              more formal stratum of language for its role in  supporting these semantic
              functions.        The main goal of this project will be to outline the 
              fundamental conceptual structuring system of language. Language  has a formally
              distinct component - that of closed-class forms    whose specific role is to
              serve a structuring function: for  example, schematizing the spatial relations
              between entities and  the temporal relations between events. In this regard,
              language  is perhaps unique within the range of cognitive systems such as 
              perception, reasoning, and affect, so that mapping out the  conceptual
              structuring system of language may serve as a model  for comparable
              undertakings in the other cognitive systems.       In the book that will result
              from the research project, the  investigator's work in cognitive linguistics
              will be extended and  integrated. The analysis of language as a cognitive
              system will  be developed further, and it will be placed within a theoretical 
              matrix that includes the relation of language to other cognitive  systems.
