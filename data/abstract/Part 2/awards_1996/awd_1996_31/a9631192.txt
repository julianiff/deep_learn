Abstract    :
              9631192  Donoghue, et al.  In partnership, Harvard University and the Research
              Collections in Systematics & Ecology Program have funded this project to
              support the services provided to the plant systematics community by the Harvard
              University Herbaria.  Harvard's holdings of nearly 5,000,000 specimens of
              plants and fungi, along with its libraries and databases, form an indispensable
              resource for systematic and ecological studies and are actively used by the
              national and international botanical community.  Approximately 62,000 specimens
              are handled by the Harvard Herbaria staff each year in outgoing and returning
              loans to other institutions, and an average of 500 scientist visit the Herbaria
              annually.  Two Curatioral Assistants, who will be directly involved in the loan
              and visitor programs, will be hired during the tenure of this award, which also
              subsidizes the cost of packing materials and postal charges for shipping loans.
               Visitor facilities will be improved with the purchase of microscope and
              computer equipment.  Harvard University will continue to proved most of the
              basic operating budget of the Herbaria while the NSF and earmarked Harvard
              funds support the exceptional service activities of these collections.
