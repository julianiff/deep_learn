Abstract    :
              9631786  Tahernezhadi  This proposal involves hardware and software design
              projects for  undergraduate electrical engineering students with the aim of 
              helping persons with disabilities.  The projects will benefit  individuals with
              communicative impairment, including speech  disorders, phonetic disorders, and
              inability to communicate due  to motor disabilities.  Among the devices to be
              developed are a  software system allowing a child to practice pronunciation of 
              word lists with minimum adult supervision; a voice communicator  to be used in
              emergency situations without the need of American  Sign Language or a TTY
              device; and wireless communication devices  permitting a child to summon help
              when the caretaker is  unavailable.  Through their work, the students will gain
              valuable  engineering problem-solving skills, learn to appreciate their 
              educational experience which enabled them to assist persons with  disabilities,
              be encouraged to continue their education in the  field, and be better prepared
              for the competitive job market.  Before the actual hardware implementation,
              computer simulations  will be carried out by students to validate their
              designs.  These  computer programs will be used to demonstrate the projects to 
              potential engineering students and high school graduates at  events such as
              National Engineers' Week and college open houses.  Such demonstrations will
              attract new students into engineering  and will allow the public to have a
              better understanding of how  engineering schools are serving the local
              community.  ***
