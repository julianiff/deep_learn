Abstract    :
              Quang Vuong  University of Southern California  SBR-9631212    This research
              will attempt to develop a less restrictive  theoretical and empirical approach
              to the analysis of auctions.   The research consists of three parts: 
              nonparametric  identification in an auction model, estimation using multi-step 
              nonparametric indirect procedures and testing game theoretic  restrictions
              imposed by an auction model.  The new approaches to  be developed will be
              applied to the analysis of the following  data:  eggplant auctions in Marmande,
              timber auctions in Mazamet,  ONF Timber auctions, CNES procurement auctions and
              U.S. outer  continental shelf auctions.  The output of this research may  allow
              private and governmental groups to improve the design of  future auctions.
