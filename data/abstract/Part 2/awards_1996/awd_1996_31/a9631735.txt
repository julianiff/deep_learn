Abstract    :
              9631735  Poulson   This proposal was submitted in response to the Environmental
              Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry solicitation, NSF 92-6.  It is being jointly
              funded by the Earth Sciences Division, the Molecular and Cellular Sciences
              Division, and the EPSCoR office.  The proposed research will involve the use of
              stable isotopes as a potential technique to investigate the sources and
              processes affecting behavior of hazardous organic compounds in the subsurface. 
              The proposed interdisciplinary research will combine geochemical and
              microbiological components in an experimental investigation of the carbon
              isotope systematics of toluene, one of  the five more frequently detected
              groundwater contaminants at hazardous sites.  the research will emphasize
              fractionation accompanying processes such as adsorption, volatilization,
              dissolution of a free liquid phase, and microbial degradation.  Stable isotope
              compositions will be monitored using gas chromatography - combustion - isotope
              ratio mass spectrometry.  The research may ultimately contribute to approaches
              used to identify and quantify natural processes involving these organic
              compounds and also to engineer remediation efforts.
