Abstract    :
              ***  9631589  Ban   PD-LD, Inc. in cooperation with the ATC/POEM (Advanced
              Technology Center/Princeton Opto Electronic Materials) of Princeton University,
              has recently developed a totally new method for the growth of thin films of
              complex organic compounds, called Organic Vapor Phase Deposition, OVPD. This
              new method was successfully used to deposit thin films of chemically pure DAST,
              a material with optical nonlinear properties among best reported.   On the
              basis of these results, PD-LD, Inc. with its President, Dr. Vladimir S. Ban as
              the Principal Investigator and ATC/POEM with its Director, Professor Stephen R.
              Forrest as the Chief Adviser, propose to develop a prototype fiber optic
              modulator, based on thin films of DAST deposited by OVPD on a silicon optical
              bench configured for efficient coupling to optical fibers.           This
              proposal addresses for the first time the integration of waveguides of highly
              non linear organic materials with silicon optical benches, which might be
              populated with standard fiber optic components, such as laser diodes,
              detectors, optical fibers, etc. Thus, this proposal represents an important
              step toward the fully integrated optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEIC),
              where different materials will be combined for the optimal performance of
              various functions, such as light generation, light guiding, light modulating
              and light detection.    ***
