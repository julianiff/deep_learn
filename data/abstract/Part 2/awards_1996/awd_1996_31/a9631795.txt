Abstract    :
              Clark U.   This proposal is for research which examines the middle ground
              between general beliefs and specific reasons for economic action using the
              discourses of actors in New England's industrialization (1790-1860) as case
              material.  The social theoretic research uses an intra-regional study of
              economic actors and involves three types of analysis.  First, a clarification
              of the philosophical-theoretical notion of the cultural-discursive formation of
              economic rationality is intended which will culminate in a `cultural order of
              production` concept.  Second, new historical research will be initiated on the
              discursive constitution of early economic actors in New England and the
              cultural construction of economic forms.  Third, the work will synthesize
              theory with empirical findings in a cultural production of New England
              industrialization.  The main empirical research involves distinct types of
              modern manufacturing systems which have emerged from the pre-industrial New
              England moral economy.  Local history work will be carried out in several towns
              where small producers rapidly became modern capitalist entrepreneurs.  The
              research is significant because it shows that economic activities have cultural
              origins.  Second, the work will place regional economic development in a
              broader cultural framework.
