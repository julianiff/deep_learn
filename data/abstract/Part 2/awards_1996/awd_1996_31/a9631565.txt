Abstract    :
                   It is still unclear how the combination of an internal  clock  and
              environmental   light regulate the well-known daily  circadian  changes in
              activity of both   vertebrate and invertebrate animals.  Molecular mechanisms
              are being   discovered in many laboratories, but little is known about the
              biochemical and   physiological mechanisms in the eye and brain.  Clock
              function prepares the   photoreceptors in the retina of the eye to function
              optimally in different   backgrounds of daylight, dusk, or night; in turn,
              visual input from the eyes help   modulate the correct timing of the running
              clock in the brain.  This project uses   the horseshoe crab, Limulus, as a
              model system that is amenable to extensive   biochemical analysis.  Molecular,
              biochemical and immunochemical approaches   are used to see how the clock may
              produce and modulate (phosphorylated)   particular proteins in the retina.  One
              protein in the photoreceptors is known to   have both structural and enzyme
              properties, and experiments test how its   functions are modulated by the clock
              input from the brain to the eye.  The   biochemical nature of how the clock
              input to the eye can  prime  the   photoreceptor response to light is studied
              by testing the role of the clock and the   role of light in driving gene
              expression in the eye, separately or in combination.     These studies will
              provide new insights into the biochemical processes   underlying the
              day-to-night changes in the retina that are critical for normal   vision.  The
              impact extends beyond visual neuroscience to the analysis of   circadian
              behavior, and potentially to how human daily cyclic activity may be  
              modulated.
