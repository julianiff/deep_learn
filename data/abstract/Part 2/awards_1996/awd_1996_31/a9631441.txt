Abstract    :
              9631441  Hogstrand    Every living organism needs minute quantities of zinc.
              However, female squirrelfish (Holocentridae) accumulate massive quantities of
              zinc in liver and ovaries. This zinc seems to be used for reproductive
              processes. In response to estrogen, zinc is transported from the ovaries where
              it may be required for egg development. Female squirrelfish liver have at least
              two proteins that handle zinc. One of these proteins, metallothionein, is found
              in the cell nucleus. Nuclear localization of metallothionein is unusual and in
              mammals it has been associated with rapidly dividing cells, such as tumor
              cells. The other major zinc-binding protein in female squirrelfish liver has
              not been observed anywhere else and its function is unknown. Thus, in many
              aspects squirrelfish present an entirely new view of zinc in biological systems
              and demonstrate the ability of zinc in biological systems and demonstrate the
              ability of some animals to handle this essential, but potentially toxic,
              element. The long-term goals of this project are to (1) identify novel aspects
              of the role of zinc in reproductive biology, to (2) determine the role of
              metallothionein in reproduction, and (3) characterize the novel female-specific
              zinc-binding protein (FZnBP).
