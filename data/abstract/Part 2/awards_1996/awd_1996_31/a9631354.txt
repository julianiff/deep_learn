Abstract    :
                       Impingement of fish into hydroelectric dams and water intakes to  power
              plants is a significant problem in many parts of the United  States. The
              problems are two-fold. First, many fish are killed when  they encounter the
              dams or intakes and cannot escape the rapidly  flowing water. Second, there is
              potential damage to the power  generating equipment due to the large number of
              impinged fish. Thus,  it is of considerable economic importance to find ways to
              prevent the  interactions between fish and the dams or power plant intakes.    
                    One of the most successful methods developed to date is the use of  high
              frequency sound to repel clupeid fishes (herrings and relatives)  from these
              obstacles. For reasons that are yet unknown, these  commercially important
              species swim away from these sounds. At the  same time, we know very little
              about how clupeids detect the  ultrasonic sounds, or the kinds of sounds that
              can be most  successfully used to repel the fish. The purpose of this study is
              to  examine the hearing ability of clupeids in order to better understand  how
              they detect sounds, and which sounds they detect, with the  ultimate goal being
              to develop methods to more effectively prevent  the impingement of clupeids at
              dams and power plant intakes.
