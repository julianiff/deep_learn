Abstract    :
              9631899  Maji  Description:  The Joint US-India Workshop on  Nondestructive
              Evaluation (NDE) of Concrete  will take place at the University of Roorkee, 
              Dec. 14-15, 1996.  It follows the 14th World  Conference on Nondestructive
              Testing (NDT)  being held in nearby New Delhi.  The co-  organizers are Arup
              Maji, University of New  Mexico and S.K. Kaushik, University of Roorkee.   The
              workshop will focus on the application of  diagnostic methods, including both
              established  techniques and emerging technologies, to cement  based composite
              materials.  Participants will  identify specific research areas in NDE that 
              would yield mutual benefit from Indo-US  collaboration.    Scope:  Roorkee is a
              leader  in concrete technology and India's premier  institution for Civil
              Engineering education and  research.  The workshop is locally co-sponsored  by
              the Indian Institute of Cement and host,  Roorkee University.  INT will provide
              airfare  for six U.S. participants including young  scientists and women. 
              Proceedings and summary  papers will be published in both countries.   ***
