Abstract    :
              9631838  Ewing   In this project, tropospheric aerosols will be studied using
              infrared spectroscopy. Sea salt aerosol particles will be generated and studied
              in the laboratory under conditions that mimic those in the troposphere both in
              high and mid-latitudes. Chemical transformation of these aerosols by nitrogen
              oxides and acids of nitrogen oxides will be followed by infrared spectroscopy.
              The object is to unravel the temperature and humidity dependent mechanisms by
              which aerosols containing sodium chloride are transformed into sodium nitrate
              with the release of chemically active chlorine. Adsorbed layers of water
              influence the chemistry on salt particle surfaces even under arid conditions.
              The properties of the salt-water interface will be studied. Aerosol salt
              solution droplets, common to the marine boundary layer, will also be
              investigated. Spectroscopic experiments to study the uptake of sulfur dioxide
              in aerosols of water and ice particles are planned.  ***
