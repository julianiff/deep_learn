Abstract    :
              With this award,  the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic   Chemistry
              Program supports research by Dr. Steven P. Nolan of the   Chemistry Department,
              University of New Orleans, for studies to determine   bond strengths in
              organometallic compounds.  Metal-ligand bond enthalpies   will be determined
              primarily for carbonyl and phosphine bonds for   compounds involved in 
              homogeneous catalysis.   Novel mono- and   bi-dentate phosphines and phosphites
              of iron and ruthenium, and ruthenium   and rhodium carbonyls will be studied. 
              In addition some metal-carbon,   metal-hydrogen, and metal-silicon bond
              enthalpies will be investigated.       Thermodynamic data provides a
              quantitative basis for understanding   reactivity in reactions, including
              catalytic reactions.  The feasibility   of new reactions can be predicted and
              design of new catalysts can be   optimized.  The available thermodynamic data
              on organometallic compounds   is limited.  This research will provide basic
              information on the enthalpy   for breaking metal-carbon and metal-phosphorus
              bonds in compounds related   to those found in important industrial catalysts.
