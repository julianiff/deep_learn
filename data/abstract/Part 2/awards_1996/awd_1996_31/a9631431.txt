Abstract    :
              9631431  Flynn  The fossil mammal collections at the Field Museum of Natural
              History is an imortant national and international systematic and
              paleontological resource for research and education.  It comprises more than
              60,000 catalogued specimens. Of these, 20,000 have been collected since 1981,
              which means that the data associated with them is exceptionally complete.  This
              rate of growth, however, has rendered the collection very overcrowded, which is
              a danger to the specimens; in addition, for some years it has not been possible
              to house all of the fossil mammal specimens in contiguous cases.  The Field
              Museum recently constructed a new space to house certain of its collections.
              This project will install compactors in a portion of the new space, fill these
              with new cases, and move the entire fossil mammal collection into one
              contiguous section of cases.  Such a move will enhance curation and
              conservation of the specimens, make the collection much more accessible for use
              in education and research, and enable more efficient collection management.
              This $1.1 million project is funded in partnership between the Research
              Collections in Systematics & Ecology program of the NSF and the Field Museum,
              which is providing approximately 55% of the total in construction and equipment
              costs, student tuition, and staff time.
