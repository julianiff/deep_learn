Abstract    :
              9631919  Chow  The proposed research includes:  (a) Development of efficient
              algorithms for the solution of  conventional and advanced formulations of the
              Hoo and  model-matching design methods as applied to multi-input,  multi-output
              aircraft engine design problems. (b) Demonstration  of the use of the iterative
              LMI algorithm to compute controllers  with order, magnitude, phase, and
              structural constraints. (c)  Development of new capabilities of the iterative
              LMI algorithm to  include, for example, synthesis problems. (d) Improvement of
              the  iterative LMI algorithm.  The research will be conducted by the  PI, with
              contributions from a team of control engineers from GE  CR&D and Aircraft
              Engines.    ***
