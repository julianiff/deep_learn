Abstract    :
              9631021  Crosby  The Missouri Botanical Garden, with funding from a partnership
              among a variety of governmental and non-governmental agencies, foundations, and
              private donations, is building a new Research Facility. The building will
              provide state-of-the-art, environmentally-friendly, earthquake-proof,
              climate-controlled space for its collections and research library, as well as
              offices for researchers.  The herbarium room in this new building will provide
              compactorized storage for approximately one-half of the Garden's 4.3 million
              specimens (the remainder will continue to occupy the current herbarium
              building).  This award represents 50% of the purchase price of the compactor
              carriages and shelving for the herbarium room; the other 50% will be matched by
              the Garden in partnership with NSF.  The building will be completed in 1998,
              and the compactors installed and filled shortly thereafter.
