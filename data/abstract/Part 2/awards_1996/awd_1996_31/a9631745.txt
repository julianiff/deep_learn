Abstract    :
                  IBN:  9631745  PI:  Schnaar    Nerve cells send signals to other nerve cells
              and to target tissues (such as muscle) through long cellular extensions, or
              "wires," called axons. In the developing brain, billions of growing axons weave
              their way to their appropriate targets through a free-wheeling process of
              extension and migration. After appropriate connections are established, many of
              the axons are wrapped by layers of insulation, called myelin, which is made by
              support cells in the brain. In addition to insulating the axons, myelin signals
              them to stop extending and migrating, thereby stabilizing the pattern of
              connections in the mature brain. Specific molecules on myelin interact with
              complementary molecules on the axon, like a lock and key, to trigger the axon
              to stop extending or migrating. This proposal investigates the structures and
              functions of these interacting molecules. Specifically, a well-defined protein
              on myelin, called myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG for short) is one of the
              myelin molecules responsible for signaling axons to stop growing. We discovered
              complementary sugar molecules on the surface of axons which bind to MAG, and
              which may be responsible for initiating the "stop growing" signal. Experiments
              detailed in this proposal will test whether these axon sugar molecules, termed
              gangliosides, are required in order for MAG to halt axon extension and
              migration. Gangliosides with different structural variations will be tested, to
              define the specific chemical determinants required for MAG's binding and
              actions. These studies may elucidate basic molecular mechanisms for
              stabilization of neuronal connections in the mature brain, and may help explain
              why central nervous system axons fail to regenerate in some vertebrates,
              including mammals.
