Abstract    :
              ***  9622432  Mote  This research project investigates its effects of shear and 
              internal forces resulting from handling and transport of web  material at high
              speeds. The wrinkling instability and the  flutter of webs transported in air
              or other fluids are the  common, and often the principal, limitations to
              productivity in  web systems. Current research provides the deflection and the 
              state of membrane stress required for study of web stability and  wrinkling.
              Nonlinear modeling of the translating web and a  singular perturbation modeling
              of the flexural stiffness is used  to deduce the relationship between the
              critical boundary shear,  the web stiffness, and the transport speed under
              various  wrinkling conditions. Singular perturbation techniques are used  to
              treat the small, finite flexural stiffness. The maximization  of transport
              speed is pursued through the flutter and wrinkling  analyses of webs
              translating close to a surface that is designed  to avoid instabilities.***
