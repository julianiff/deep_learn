Abstract    :
              This grant is to support travel for the ACM Workshop on Applied  Computational
              Geometry to be held on May 27-28, l996 in  conjunction with the second
              Federated Computing Research  Conferences (FCRC) in Philadelphia, immediately
              following the ACM  Symposium on Computation Geometry.  This workshop is mainly 
              designed to bring together practitioners and theoreticians in  computational
              geometry and other related applied fields to  discuss the current research and
              future directions in these  communities, to facilitate technology transfer from
              theory to  practice, and to identity future joint programs and  collaboration.
