Abstract    :
                  9622196  Adams  Mathematical modeling will be undertaken of the dynamic 
              instabilities in the sliding of two surfaces with emphasis  on the effects on
              these instabilities of surface roughness  and surface layers.  It will be
              attempted to link the  instabilities and the subsequently generated surface
              slip  waves to macroscopically observed friction and wear, as  reported in the
              literature.  In particular, the possible  relation between slip wave
              destabilization and stick-slip  and contact fatigue will be explored.  ***
