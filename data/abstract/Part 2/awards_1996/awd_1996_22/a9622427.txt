Abstract    :
              This award supports an investigation on number-theoretical  problems on zeta
              functions and automorphic forms. The Euler  products associated to  automorphic
              forms, Eisenstein series, and  the special values of certain  zeta functions
              are the main  objects of study. The theory of such Euler products (or zeta 
              functions) is one of the central themes of modern number theory,  and
              Eisenstein series are analytic functions inseparably  connected to them. The
              investigation of special values of zeta  functions is  relatively new, but has
              become the subject of  increasing interest.    This research falls into the
              general  mathematical field of Number Theory.  Number theory has its 
              historical roots in the study of the whole numbers,  addressing  such questions
              as those dealing with the divisibility of one   whole number by another. It is
              among the oldest branches of  mathematics and  was pursued for many centuries
              for purely  aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last half century it has 
              become an indispensable tool in diverse  applications in areas  such as data
              transmission and processing, and  communication  systems.
