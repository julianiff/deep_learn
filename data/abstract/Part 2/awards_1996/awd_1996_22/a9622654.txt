Abstract    :
              9622654  Melloy   This research will develop generic models which can accurately
              predict human performance in selected classes of complex  inspection tasks and
              can serve as a basis for selection and training of human inspectors.   The
              research is composed of seven tasks:  (1) development of a conceptual
              framework, (2) development of mathematical models, (3) development of computer
              based inspection training program, (4) model verification, (5) model validation
              in a controlled setting, (6) validation with field data, and (7) development of
              guidelines for inspection training.   Once developed, these models will support
              the design of training interventions, which will lead to enhanced inspector
              performance and consequent improvements in inspection quality.  Development and
              field testing will be done in cooperation with CIBA Vision Corporation, a
              manufacturer of contact lenses.  Contact lenses are FDA-regulated Class 2
              medical devices and inspection is necessary to ensure compliance.  This
              provides an excellent testbed for evaluating both the accuracy and efficacy of
              the models developed and the ensuing training program.
