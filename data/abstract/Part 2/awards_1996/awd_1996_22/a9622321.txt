Abstract    :
              HRD-9622321    This information dissemination award project, Visualizing Women 
              in Mathematics, the Physical Sciences, and Technology:  The Role of  Personal
              Choice and Inspiration in a Scientist's Life, targets  young women,
              particularly at the high school level.  The project is  to result in a series
              of gallery-quality posters of women in SEM,  a study guide targeted at high
              school girls with biographical  information about those depicted, along with
              educational hands-on  activities related to their respective fields of
              expertise, and  other educational resources.  Information in the study guide is
              to  be part of what is to available on the World Wide Web.  Short  videotape
              interviews with the women also are to be produced.  The  project seeks to
              humanize the image of science and the scientist to  encourage young women
              students to see science and research as  possible careers for them.  The use of
              high quality, attractive and  accessible contemporary art and graphics, along
              with the use of  other media, is expected to further the perception of science
              and  technology as inviting, exciting, rewarding career choices for  women.
