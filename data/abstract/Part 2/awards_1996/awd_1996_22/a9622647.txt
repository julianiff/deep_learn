Abstract    :
              9622647  Ehrhardt  This research deals with finished goods management models for
              just-in-time (JIT) production.  Several different formulations of the dynamic
              decision making environment will be considered, eventually emphasizing the
              infinite-horizon version of each model.  In each case the general objectives
              will be essentially the same: (a) understand how optimal policies and costs
              depend on order size and schedule stability (using theoretical analysis of
              dynamic programming models), (b) develop effective heuristic policies that have
              modest requirements for demand information and computational effort (using
              theoretical and computational studies of dynamic programming models) and (c)
              investigate system behavior when demand parameters are estimated by
              periodically revised statistical estimates (using discrete-event digital
              simulation models).    This research should result in mathematical models
              sufficiently developed so that implementation tactics can be developed for
              facilitating the management of the interface between a JIT manufacturing
              process and unpredictable external demand for finished goods.  Implementable
              computer software, ready for field testing, should be in place.
