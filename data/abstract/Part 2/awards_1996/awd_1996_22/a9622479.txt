Abstract    :
              9622479  Vanderlick    A variety of laser-based optical techniques can be used
              to probe the fundamental properties of the oil-water interface (such as
              fluctuations), as well as the phase behavior and structure of mono-molecular
              films which may be residing there.  Technologies which depend on mixtures of
              oils and water rely on a deep understanding of these properties and the
              materials used to stabilize the interface.  The principal investigator recently
              designed a film balance to manipulate insoluble monolayers (such as
              phospholipids) residing at the interface between oil and water, thereby
              controlling the tension of the fluid-fluid interface.  This film balance will
              form the hub of a laser-based experimental station which implements and takes
              advantage of different optical techniques to probe the statics and dynamics of
              interfaces with controlled tension.  The laser source has already been
              acquired, and one technique-Brewster Angle Microscopy-is already on-line.  A
              correlater and the necessary optical components to set-up a surface dynamic
              light scattering (SDLS) apparatus will be acquired with his grant.  SDLS
              provides information on the fluctuations of interfaces, which can be used to
              determine interfacial tension as well as film rheological parameters.  The
              equipment will be used to study the phase behavior and rheology of lipid and
              lipid/protein films.  ***
