Abstract    :
               This award provides support for research on a new class of jointless mechanical
              mechanisms.  These mechanisms, which obtain motion and force amplification
              through flexure, are called compliant mechanisms.  The research will seek to
              develop mathematical models of compliant mechanisms suitable for design
              synthesis, validation and demonstration of the mathematical models through
              construction of prototype devices, development of a set of compliant mechanism
              design building blocks and materials, and investigation of compliant mechanisms
              occurring in nature.  A goal of this research is the development of a
              methodology for the design of compliant mechanisms.   If successful, this
              research could impact the design of many mechanical and electromechanical
              devices.  Compliant mechanisms have the potential to drastically reduce
              mechanism parts counts and in some cases, replace even complex mechanisms with
              a single part.  Particularly in the latter case, reductions in assembly cost
              can be substantial.  Compliant mechanisms have the further advantages of
              requiring no bearing surfaces and no lubrication.  Thus despite their high
              degree of functionality, compliant parts may often be less costly to produce.
