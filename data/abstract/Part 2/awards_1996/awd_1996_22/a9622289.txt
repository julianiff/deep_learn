Abstract    :
                      9622289  Clark  This Research Equipment Grant will be used to purchase a
              variable  frequency microwave system that will be used to support research 
              projects at the Microwave Processing Research Facility at the  University of
              Florida concerning microwave effects on liquid and  solid state materials
              processing.  The proposed equipment  operates at various frequencies and power
              settings which will  extend microwave processing research studies to
              understanding the  effects of variable frequency effects on microwave materials
               processing.  Currently, multiple frequency capabilities do not  exist in the
              microwave processing facility.  Therefore, this  equipment will extend the
              research capability of the facility to  explore an area untouched before and
              should lead to new results.  ***
