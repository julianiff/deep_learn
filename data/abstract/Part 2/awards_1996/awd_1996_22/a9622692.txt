Abstract    :
              9622692  Kurfess   Modern machining facilities can produce parts with complex
              and precise geometry, but high precision coordinate measuring machines (CMMs)
              are still needed to validate these geometries.  The CMMs measure Cartesian
              coordinates of points on the part surface, and these points are fit to nominal
              part geometries using criteria like mini-max or least squares.   These methods
              yield conflicting or inconsistent results because measurement uncertainty has
              not been addressed by the analysis.   This research will develop methods that
              relate multivariate confidence intervals, the optimal location of point
              measurements for a feature, and the number of points in a way that maximizes
              information content.  An experimental program, in cooperation with industry,
              will test these advances in processing CMM data.     This research impacts both
              productivity and quality in manufacture.  For example, one application of this
              methodology is to specify the number of  points to be collected on the CMM
              based on time or cost constraints,  and then generate a sampling plan and an
              estimate of the confidence regions for the measured features.  Alternatively,
              if a specified degree of accuracy is needed, then the methodology can provide a
              sampling plan for making measurements and specify the number of points needed
              to achieve a the specified confidence region.
