Abstract    :
              9622309  Farson   This research equipment grant supports the purchase of high
              speed video equipment for research and teaching in manufacturing processes and
              materials.  The system has a laser strobe capable of 20-40 nanosecond pulses,
              and a charge-coupled device camera capable of digitizing from five thousand
              full frames to thirty thousand partial frames per second.  The team of 
              researchers will use this system for several new and ongoing research projects
              like: laser/material interaction, die-casting mold filling, plasma arc
              dynamics, ultrasonic weld modeling, composite material damage characterization,
              and ultrasonic joining.     The performance of this research equipment will
              provide quantitative data on high speed events, permitting advances in modeling
              and simulation.  To support the education programs at Ohio State University,
              this equipment will provide unique instructional materials that clearly
              illustrate process mechanisms.
