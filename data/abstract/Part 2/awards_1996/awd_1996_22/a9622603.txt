Abstract    :
                  Proposal Number: OPP 9622603    Principal Investigator: Falkner, Kelly   
              ABSTRACT     Among the outstanding issues regarding Arctic Ocean circulation
              are the fate of its riverine inputs and the nature of the processes ventilating
              sub-surface waters of its interior.  Circulation and material transport and
              transformation in the Arctic needs to be more completely characterized because
              of the potentially critical role the Arctic plays in global themohaline
              circulation and on a more immediate timescale, because of the need to predict
              the fate of pollutants, including radioactive and industrial wastes and
              pesticides, in this sensitive environment.    It is proposed to develop and
              apply new means to address these issues by adapting methodologies for mapping
              geochemical tracer fields in real time using the submarine platform, in
              combination with more conventional chemical hydrography conducted from the ice
              upon surfacing with the sub.  Specifically, a sea-going fiber optic UV
              spectrometer, will be mounted on the hull of the submarine.  This instrument
              will continuously monitor the humic fraction of dissolved organic matter along
              track during the SCICEX-96 field season (August 1996) and monitor multiple
              parameters during the SCICEX-97 field season.  In addition discreet samples
              will be taken via ice-based hydrocasts from the ice for calibration purposes
              and continuation of a related study to track Arctic river waters by geochemical
              means.  This dataset will allow an unprecedented examination of the carbon
              cycle and circulation questions in the Arctic.
