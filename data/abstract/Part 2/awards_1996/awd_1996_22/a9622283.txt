Abstract    :
              9622283  Carmen  This Research Equipment Grant will broaden the scope of the 
              research and education being conducted in Department of Mechanical,  Aerospace
              and Nuclear Engineering at the University of California,  Los Angeles.  The
              purchase of an unique sputtering system capable  of depositing thin film TiNi
              onto various substrates is novel &  should yield interesting and important
              results.  Developing a  dedicated ultra-high-high vacuum this sputtering system
              in a clean-  room facility with lithographic capability will provide a 
              nationally unique facility for thin film research at UCLA.  If the  sputtering
              equipment can be controlled so that the chemistry  variations are small then
              the potential for a breakthrough is  clearly present.  Objectives are
              well-addressed and the need for  such equipment is adequately described. 
              Researchers have an  excellent background for the proposed work and have
              demonstrated  considerable productivity.  ***
