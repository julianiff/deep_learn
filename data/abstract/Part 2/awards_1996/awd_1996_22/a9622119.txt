Abstract    :
              9622119  Vogel    The primary goal of this project is to develop robust,
              efficient   computational methods for the solution of regularized inverse
              problems.   Also to be addressed are regularization parameter selection
              schemes, and   the development of improved regularization functionals.
              Applications will   be carried out for important problems in image
              reconstruction and   parameter identification.    Inverse problems arise in a
              number of important applications. Perhaps the   most well know of these is
              biomedical imaging, e.g., CAT scans and   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).
              Other examples include satellite-  based (remote) sensing of the earth and
              seismic data processing. These   problems tend to be highly unstable, i.e.,
              small errors in the data may give   rise to enormous errors in the solution.
              They also tend to be very large---  involving thousands or even millions of
              unknowns. The goal of this project   is to develop computational techniques to
              solve such problems which are   both stable and efficient. The attainment of
              this goal will greatly enhance a   number of important technologies.
