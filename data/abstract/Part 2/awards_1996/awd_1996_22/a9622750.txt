Abstract    :
              9622750  Wadsworth    This award supports the research of Professor A. Wadsworth
              to work in non-commutative ring theory with special emphasis on problems
              arising from the theory of central simple algebras with involutions. In
              particular, Professor Wadsworth will use the theory of index reduction to study
              the triality phenomena associated to algebras of degree 8. He will also study
              questions of when an orthogonal involution of an algebra becomes isotropic and
              the similarity between tensor products of quaternion algebras with involutions
              to Pfister quadratic forms. He also hopes to see if there are non twisted flag
              varieties for which index-reduction formulas hold.     This is research in the
              subfield of algebra called non-commutative ring theory. Algebra can be thought
              of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As such, algebra has direct
              applications to areas of physics and chemistry. In fact, much of
              non-commutative ring theory generalizes structures found in quantum mechanics.
