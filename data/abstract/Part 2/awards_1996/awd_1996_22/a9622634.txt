Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9622634    A rotating ring/disk electrode (RDE) system and a
              control system for an atomic force microscope (AFM) are acquired.  They are
              used to study the roles of chloride and dissolved oxygen in copper
              electroplating, including effects on the kinetics of deposition and  on
              morphological development such as crystalline anisotropy, kinetic roughening,
              and facet formation.  ***
