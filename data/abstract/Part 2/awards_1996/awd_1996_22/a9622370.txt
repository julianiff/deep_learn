Abstract    :
              9622370  Anderson  The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering,
              Chemical Engineering, and Physics will purchase equipment  to conduct research
              in engineering requiring microelectronic fabrication.  The equipment will be
              used for several research projects including in particular: 
              metal-semiconductor contacts for photodetectors and field effect transistors;
              electro-optic effects; dielectrophorectic filters; and far infrared effects in
              semiconductors.  The equipment will greatly improve our overall capability in
              microelectronic fabrication which is utilized by many faculty, many students, 
              local industry and in teaching.  The primary focus is to achieve repeatable 1-2
              um patterning for a variety of applications.  To complement the proposal, the
              University will provide sole funding in expanding the Clean Room to house the
              new equipment.  The University provides 1/3 cost sharing for the equipment. 
              University personnel, skilled in electrical work, plumbing, air conditioning
              and electronics will assist in setting up the new equipment and in subsequent
              maintenance.  The new equipment will also support the 15 faculty from our
              Center for Electronic and Electro-optic Materials (CEEM).  This Center
              represents 5 departments and includes over 40 graduate students, some of whom
              will use the new equipment.  ***
