Abstract    :
              The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Richard Judge of the  
              University of Wisconsin-Parkside to continue his high resolution  
              spectroscopic studies of singlet-triplet transitions in silicon   difluoride,
              selenium dioxide, methylene selenide and acetaldehyde.  In   the first three
              cases, he will extend earlier work to either higher   resolution or higher
              vibrational levels.  In the latter case, he will   investigate internal
              rotation in the excited triplet state.    Analysis of the spectra will yield
              accurate information about the   geometry and excited state molecular dynamics.
               This information will   greatly assist in the interpretation of the observed
              photochemistry.  In   particular, perturbations uncovered in the analysis of
              the   singlet-triplet spectra will yield valuable information on the disposal  
              of excess energy gained on electronic promotion.  Undergraduate students   will
              directly participate in the research either during the analysis or   data
              acquisition.
