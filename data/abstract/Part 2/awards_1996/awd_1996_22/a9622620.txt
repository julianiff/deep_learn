Abstract    :
              Cavalier  9622620   This research centers on making effective use of real-time
              measurement data to develop and implement the concept of Sequential Tolerance
              Control.  The approach uses measurement information at the completion of stage
              j to exploit available space inside a dynamic feasible zone and reposition the
              set point for operations j+1 to n.  The procedure is repeated at appropriate
              locations along the n operations so as to optimize the production of an
              acceptable part.  A model and solution procedure for a generic n-constraints,
              n-operations problem is sought.  The performance of the procedure will be
              tested, as well as technological implementation demonstrated.     Conventional
              tolerance control specifies a fixed set point for each operation and
              permissible variation about this set point to insure compliance with
              specifications.  This approach is inadequate for complex, low volume, high
              value added parts such as those found in aircraft, nuclear or precision
              instrument manufacturing.  The above research should prove useful to alleviate
              the above concerns, as well as provide useful ramifications for the production
              of complex, low-volume, high-value-added parts.
