Abstract    :
              9622062  Berele    This award supports the research of Professor A. Berele to
              work in non-commutative ring theory with special emphasis on problems arising
              from generalizations of the theory of cocharacter sequences that arise in the
              study of p.i. algebras. In particular, he wants to study cocharacter sequences
              that arise from Hopf algebra actions.     This is research in the subfield of
              algebra called non-commutative ring theory. Algebra can be though of as the
              study of symmetry in the abstract. As such, algebra has direct applications to
              areas of physics and chemistry. In fact, much of non-commutative ring theory
              generalizes structures found in Quantum Mechanics and this proposal continues
              to explore areas that connect directly with modern quantum field theory. There
              are also connections to problems in many other areas of mathematics such as
              invariant theory.
