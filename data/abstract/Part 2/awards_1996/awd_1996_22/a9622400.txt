Abstract    :
              Orme  9622400  As an emerging technology, rapid prototyping is revolutionizing
              every sector of industry, creating great opportunities to design and
              manufacture products of superior quality with shorter lead-time and low costs. 
               The research project investigates a new method of solid freeform fabrication
              (SFF) of functional metallic components which relies on the deposition of metal
              in the molten state onto a substrate whose motion is guided with the direct
              coupling from CAD information.  This droplet-based SFF requires less machining
              steps than both conventional manufacturing techniques such as casting and other
              SFF technologies such as Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) and 3D printing.  The
              research project will focus on scientific issues necessary for the successful
              development of a novel rapid prototyping technique.  The proposed technique can
              generate 10,000 to 40,000 droplets/second (for orifice diameters from 25 to 100
              micron and a stream speed of 5 m/s) are injected into a controlled environment
              chamber and are deposed onto a temperature controlled substrate where they
              impinge and rapidly solidify.  The research project has a  balance between
              theory and experiment, and will provide valuable findings for the rapid
              prototyping industry.
