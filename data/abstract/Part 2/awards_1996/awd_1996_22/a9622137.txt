Abstract    :
              9622137  Lomolino  Prairie dogs appear to be keystone species, strongly
              influencing community structure and creating a dynamic landscape across short
              grass and mixed grass prairies. Prairie dog colonies once covered some 100
              million ha of North America. Now, their numbers and range may have been reduced
              to less than 5% of their historic levels. Continued decline of this keystone
              species threatens many native plants and animals that are dependent on prairie
              dog colonies. In Oklahoma, some 48 vertebrate species, many of which are
              threatened or endangered, appear to be associated with prairie dog colonies.
              The purpose of this research is to investigate the factors influencing
              establishment, persistence, and diversity of prairie dog communities. The
              investigators will test the hypothesis that the structure of these communities
              results, in part, from deterministic and species selective immigrations,
              extinctions and interspecific interactions. This research will also test the
              utility of a species-based, hierarchical model of island biogeography to
              explain patterns in biodiversity of prairie dog colonies.    This research
              represents an important, multi-species approach for conserving biodiversity of
              native prairie communities, and will provide general insights for conservation
              biology and biogeography of other terrestrial communities.
