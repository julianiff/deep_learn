Abstract    :
                         This award will support the participation of  12  undergraduate
              students each year in the Research Experiences for  Undergraduates program
              offered by the Savannah River Ecology  Laboratory (SREL) of the University of
              Georgia.  This program,  which encompasses 12 weeks each summer, allows the
              students to  gain research experience, training and career perspective through 
              the use of the unique field sites and laboratory facilities as  well as through
              association with full-time research ecologists.  Project participants will
              examine the influence of by-products  from nuclear and fossil fuel energy
              production on selected  biological and chemical properties in southeastern
              ecosystems.  SREL faculty members, all actively engaged in research and 
              publication, will be paired with students having compatible  research
              interests.  Student projects, while distinct and  independent, are portions of
              on-going research programs of SREL.  The student experience is enhanced by
              interaction with a  programmatic team comprised of individuals with a diversity
              of  ecological backgrounds, interests, and ideas.  Applicants from  minority
              schools and regional institutions with limited research  programs will continue
              to be actively sought and encouraged, as  in previous years.  Participant
              selection is based upon the  quality of an application, letters of
              recommendation, and  academic record.  Through the research training of more
              than 500  undergraduate participants over the past 27 years, SREL has  created
              a highly successful program of student/advisor  interaction. Scientific
              publication and career development of  former participants attest to the
              success of the program.       This award will foster the continued education
              and training  of individuals who will be part of the next generation of basic 
              researchers in ecology and help to produce citizens informed  about various
              aspects of environmental sciences, management, and  decision making in
              environmental issues.
