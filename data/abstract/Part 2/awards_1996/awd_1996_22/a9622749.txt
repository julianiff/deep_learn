Abstract    :
              9622749  Trosset   Numerical algorithms for multidimensional scaling (MDS)
              construct  geometric configurations from dissimilarity data by attempting to 
              solve specific optimization problems.  It has long been widely  believed that
              most MDS problems are plagued by the existence of  local solutions that are not
              global solutions, and considerable  effort has been expended addressing this
              difficulty.  Recently,  various researchers have proposed searching for global
              solutions  by such "off-the-shelf" global optimization methods as simulated 
              annealing, tunneling, and continuation.  These methods are quite 
              computationally expensive and research by the principal  investigator suggests
              that they may be largely unnecessary.  This  research involves properly
              reformulating the structure of many  important MDS problems such that local
              searches, which invariably  find global solutions, can be exploited.  This
              research concerns computational methods for multidimensional  scaling, a
              collection of statistical techniques for  mathematically constructing geometric
              configurations of objects  from information about the distances between those
              objects.  For  example, a chemist might want to "construct" a molecule with 
              certain interatomic distances, or a psychologist might want to  geometrically
              represent a set of stimuli using data about the  differences that human
              subjects perceived between pairs of  stimuli.  Such problems pose formidable
              computational challenges.   The focus of this research is on developing more
              efficient  methods for computing optimal solutions of these problems.
