Abstract    :
              9622699  Goldburg  This award provides support for the acquisition of a laser 
              Doppler velocimeter for the purpose of studying turbulence  in soap films.  The
              goal of this project is to better  understand two-dimensional turbulence as
              well as the physics  of a soap film under shear.  We have demonstrated that a 
              laser Doppler velocimeter is a powerful instrument for  exploring turbulence in
              soap films and for studying their  unexpected rheological properties.  %%%  It
              follows from the basic laws that govern fluid flow, that  two-dimensional (2D)
              turbulence differs qualitatively from  its three-dimensional (3D) counterpart. 
              Soap films are so  thin relative to their lateral dimensions that, to a very 
              good approximation, they should behave like a 2D fluid.  Nevertheless there are
              very few experiments to support this  claim.  In our laboratory we have
              produced strong enough  turbulence in a soap film that its two dimensional
              character  becomes apparent.  The instrument is one of general utility  and
              will be used in ordinary three-dimensional turbulence as  well.  ***
