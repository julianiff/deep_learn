Abstract    :
              9300402  Smith    University of Alaska will operate the R/V ALPHA HELIX during
              1996  as a general oceanographic research vessel in support of NSF-funded 
              projects.  The R/V ALPHA HELIX is a 133' general research vessel  owned by the
              National Science foundation and constructed in 1966.   The ship is scheduled
              for 174 operating days in 1996, of which 123  days are in support of
              NSF-sponsored projects.  The cruises will be  primarily in the north Pacific
              Ocean but include significant  research cruise legs to the Aleutian, Bering,
              and Chukchi Sea  regions during minimum ice conditions in late summer.    This
              vessel is part of a fleet used by NSF and other research  agencies to support
              oceanographic research.  Most oceanographic  research requires specialized
              equipment that must be permanently  installed on the research vessel.  Trained
              crew members are also  required to support the equipment systems and research
              operations.   This is the first year of a planned three year award.  ***
