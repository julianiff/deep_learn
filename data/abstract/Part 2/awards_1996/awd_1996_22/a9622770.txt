Abstract    :
              9622770  Milne    Professor Milne works in arithmetic geometry specifically on
              problems in Diophantine geometry. He will study the conjecture of Langlands and
              Rapaport on points on Shimura varieties over finite fields. He also hopes to
              study the degeneration of abelian motives with the hope of exploiting the
              relation to Shimura varieties in order to obtain information about the
              compactifications of Shimura varieties over number fields.    This project
              falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry -a subject that blends two
              of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This
              combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved
              problems that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new error
              correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard
              disks) and compact disks.     ??
