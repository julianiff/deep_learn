Abstract    :
              9622246  Gupta   A proper encapsulation is essential for high-assembly yields
              and a long-term reliability of the chip in the semiconductor manufacturing. 
              However, if the mold-geometry, encapsulating material and the processing
              conditions are not selected properly, the flow during the transfer molding of
              plastic may produce a gapwise movement of the microchip/leadframe assembly as
              well as deform the connecting wires.  Currently,  the mold design is based upon
              trial-and-error approach.  This collaborative GOALI award will develop a
              software tool for flow simulation of the encapsulation process so that the mold
              designer will be able to predict the defects in the molded device and modify
              the molding process accordingly to reduce the assembly defects during
              production.   This work is likely to provide significant advancement in the
              development of a combined fluid-flow/curing model which is expandable to other
              applications outside of the encapsulation processes.
