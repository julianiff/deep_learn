Abstract    :
              This project will understand the sources of severe mid-latitude ionospheric
              weather during the coming solar minimum period.  In particular, the PI will
              study the role of electrodynamics and plasma physics in controlling the
              character of traveling ionospheric disturbances.  In addition, he will
              determine whether plasma physical processes can amplify small disturbances
              seeded in the ionosphere by atmospheric waves to the extent indicated by
              observation of the most violent mid-latitude events.  The investigators will
              both coordinate the activities of a number of US scientists and carry out
              crucial investigations using the largest remote sensing radar, near Arecibo,
              Puerto Rico.  Graduate students, undergraduate students, entry-level
              professionals, and senior scientists will all participate in this CEDAR
              project, and use the yearly meeting to coordinate experiments, as well as
              analyze the interpret the data.
