Abstract    :
              This grant supports the research of Professors Costa and Keller  to study the
              normal subgroups of the linear, classical and  Chevalley groups over rings.
              They want to extend the results  already obtained for the special linear and
              spin groups to the  linear groups of type B, G and F. They also intend to study
              the  relationship between subgroups of the special linear group of  dimension 2
              over a  local field and Hilbert symbols.     This is research in the field of
              algebra. This area can be  thought of as the study of symmetry in the abstract.
              As such,  this area has direct applications to many areas of physics and 
              chemistry. Moreover, within the last 30 years, many connections  to problems in
              data transmission have been solved using  techniques from group theory. There
              are also direct connections  to the error correcting codes that are vital for
              modern computing  such as working with CD-ROM's as well as to theoretical
              computer  science in general.
