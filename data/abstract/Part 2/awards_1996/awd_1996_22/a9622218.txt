Abstract    :
              The introduction of exotic species into new habitats has negative effects on
              native species including predation on native species by introduced predators. 
              In Lake Victoria, Uganda, Africa an estimated 50% of the 400+ native species of
              fishes have apparently disappeared in the last 15 years.  One possible cause is
              predation by the introduced Nile perch, Lates niloticus.  Previous studies have
              identified wetlands as important refuges protecting some fishes from Nile perch
              predation.  These refugia may have low oxygen levels and structural complexity
              that protects adapted fishes by inhibiting perch dispersal into the wetlands. 
              The objectives of this proposal are to 1) develop a predictive model of fish
              species richness and diversity for lagoon refugia; 2) examine the changes of
              fish communities in lagoons through field sampling and paleolimnological
              techniques; 3) apply predictions derived from small lagoon refugia to larger
              satellite lakes; and 4) examine how physical structure and oxygen concentration
              of wetlands affects lagoon colonization by Nile perch and prey species.    The
              identification and protection of refugia has become critical to the survival of
              native fauna.  This study will help identify characteristics of refugia that
              harbor remnant populations and that limit or permit use of refugia.  The
              problems in the Lake Victoria Basin addressed by the principal investigators
              are relevant to the conservation of fishes in many wetland regions and have
              broader implications for the conservation of faunal remnants in many systems
              where taxa survive in small isolated patches.
