Abstract    :
              9622876  Goodearl    This award supports the research of Professor K. Goodearl
              to work in non-commutative ring theory with special emphasis on problems
              arising from the theory of Quantum Groups. In particular, Professor Goodearl
              will continue to investigate analogies between Quantum Groups and enveloping
              algebras of solvable Lie algebras concentrating on the non-root-of-unity case. 
                 This is research in the subfield of algebra called non-commutative ring
              theory. Algebra can be though of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As
              such, algebra has direct applications to areas of physics and chemistry. In
              fact, much of non-commutative ring theory generalizes structures found in
              Quantum Mechanics and this proposal continues to explore areas that connect
              directly with modern quantum field theory.     ??
