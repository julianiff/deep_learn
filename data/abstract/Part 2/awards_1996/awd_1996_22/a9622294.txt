Abstract    :
              9622294  Schnoor    The ion-trap mass spectrometer with a membrane introduction 
              system requested in this proposal will be dedicated to  support research in
              environmental engineering.  The  instrument will be used for several projects,
              including: 1)  Uptake of BETX Compounds and Metabolites by Hybrid Poplar  Trees
              in Hazardous Waste Prevention and Remediation; 2)  Terrestrial Phytoremediation
              of Ammunition Wastes; 3)  Reductive Dechlorination of  Halogenated Methanes
              with Iron  Metal; 4) Stimulation of BTX Bioremediation by  Environmentally
              Acceptable Aromatic Substances; and 5)  Application of Anaerobic and
              Multiple-Electron-Acceptor  Bioremediaton of Chlorinated Subsurface
              Contamination.    Coupled with a membrane introduction sampling system, the 
              mass spectrometer will allow for the continuous and  simultaneous monitoring of
              volatile components of  environmental concern in a water matrix.  Using syringe
               injections, the instrument will be used as a structure  identification
              technique for nonvolatile compounds such ass  trinitrotoluene and pesticides.  
               The information gained from these laboratory experiments  will be applied to
              field pollution prevention and  remediation situations.  If successful, the
              strategies  developed with the help of the proposed equipment have the 
              potential to save millions of dollars by offering more cost  effective, in-situ
              site remediation techniques.
