Abstract    :
              This study will link the distribution, pattern of movement, and resource use of
              martens in different forest habitats using Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
              in order to determine the marten's response to habitat change at varying
              spatial scales.  We will determine the scale at which marten movement is most
              sensitive to the arrangement of physical and vegetation structure,
              characteristics that are frequently altered by human use of forest lands.  Most
              data will be gathered during the winter when martens show strongly selective
              patterns of movement and resource use.  Our methods will combine snowtracking
              of martens and DNA 'fingerprinting" from fur samples collected by hairsnares to
              estimate abundance and movement  in relation to habitat structure determined
              from NASA satellite imagery and U. S. Forest Service data.  Models will be
              developed to evaluate how the scale of vegetative and weather variables
              explicitly influence marten resource use, and how varying levels of forest
              fragmentation influence movement patterns and population dispersion relative to
              landscape attributes. The non-intrusive, low-cost methods employed by this
              study are unique additions to forest ecology and management, and will play an
              important role as we move to large-scale and long-term management of
              sustainable ecosystems and regions.
