Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for a project to study affine and  double affine Hecke
              algebras. The latter algebras (recently  introduced by the principal
              investigator) lead to a new approach  to various problems in representation
              theory, special functions,  harmonic analysis, conformal field theory, 
              combinatorics,  topology, and number theory. The main objectives are (1) the 
              theory of differential and difference operators acting on  polynomials, theta
              functions and various generalizations, (2)  representations of double affine
              Hecke algebras at roots of  unity, connections with the monodromy of the double
              affine KZ  equations and elliptic braid groups, (3) the action of the  modular
              group on the Macdonal polynomials, (4) relations to  quantum groups of elliptic
              type, Kac-Moody algebras, matrix  models, and W-algebras, and (5) applications
              to harmonic  analysis.   This research is in the general area of 
              Combinatorics. Combinatorics  attempts to find efficient methods  to study how
              discrete collections of  objects can be arranged.  The behavior of discrete
              systems is extremely  important to  modern communications. For example, the
              design of large   networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and
              the  design of  algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets  of
              objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research. This  research also
              deals with orthogonal polynomials, which are useful  in designing optical
              transmission lines.
