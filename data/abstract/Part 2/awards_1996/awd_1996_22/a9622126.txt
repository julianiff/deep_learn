Abstract    :
              9622126  Derr  Worldwide, many species of large vertebrates have, or soon will,
              encounter population challenges similar to what occurred in the last century
              with bison. Many of these species, like bison, are polygynous and now are
              limited to highly fragmented and managed ecosystems. This research will
              investigate genetic diversity in North American bison populations before and
              after the human induced population bottleneck of the last century. In the last
              100 years, population sizes have recovered. The primary founders for this
              restoration effort have come from only five herds, four from the northern herd,
              and one from the southern herd. This research is designed to test the
              conservation question that relatively low levels of genetic polymorphisms in
              extant populations are a direct result of the 19th Century bottleneck and that
              conservation efforts should be directed at maximizing the remaining genetic
              variation among herds. To test this hypothesis, polymerase chain reaction and
              nucleotide sequencing will be used to examine genetic diversity in both
              mitochondrial and nuclear genomes of extant and historical (pre-bottleneck)
              populations. Historical population data will be derived from the extensive
              fossil materials available.   Because conservation and restoration efforts have
              proved so successful with bison, they provide an ideal model system to develop
              management plans for the genetic effects of population bottlenecks and habitat
              fragmentation for other megavertebrate species. This study will have direct
              bearing on the ability of populations to regain genetic diversity, and on
              issues regarding minimum viable population size of large vertebrates.
