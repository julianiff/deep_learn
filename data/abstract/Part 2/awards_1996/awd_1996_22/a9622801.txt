Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for studies of modular forms, abelian   varieties, and
              Galois representations. Gerhard Frey's  construction, which associates triples
              of integers to elliptic  curves over the rational numbers, has led to a direct
              link  between the investigator's subject and simple problems involving  whole
              numbers. Frey's  construction has led to a proof of  Fermat's Last Theorem and
              a  resolution of several allied  problems in mathematics. Many questions remain
              to be resolved -  the ABC conjecture is perhaps the best known. One expects
              that  arithmetic algebraic geometry will continue to flourish; the 
              investigator is working on some of the problems that are now "on  the table" as
              well as other problems which emerge over time.     This project falls into the
              general area of arithmetic geometry -  a subject that blends two of the oldest
              areas of mathematics:  number theory and geometry.  This combination has proved
               extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that  withstood
              generations.  Among its many consequences are new error  correcting codes. 
              Such codes are essential for both modern  computers (hard disks) and compact
              disks.
