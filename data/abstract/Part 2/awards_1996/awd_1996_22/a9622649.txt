Abstract    :
              9622649    Jiles      Rapidly quenched metallic glasses such as
              Iron-Born-Silicon (Fe-B-Si) have found applications as soft magnetic core
              materials in electrical transformers and motors due to their intrinsic low
              energy losses under a wide spectrum of frequencies. Specifically, they exhibit
              low dc hysteresis loss and low classical loss (associated with low thermal
              conductivity). The current research aims to reduce the excess eddy current
              portion of the total core losses. The approach is to modify the magnetic domain
              structure on the surface by using laser scribing. Thermal modeling will be
              attempted  taking into account the rough surface and low thermal diffusivity of
              metallic glasses. The combined modeling and experimentation is likely to lead
              to a better understanding of laser interaction with metallic glasses. If the
              hypothesis to reduce eddy current losses by laser scribing is proven, it will
              be an attractive manufacturing process for the transformer core manufacturer
              who is actively participating in this research providing both monetary and 
              researcher's time.    Electric power conversion inefficiencies in transformers
              and motors is a major drain of energy running into billions of dollars. A major
              source of waste lies in the energy loss of magnetic cores in these devices.
              This research offers an innovative manufacturing process step which has the
              potential to reduce the energy loss in a new class of magnetic materials. The
              US manufacturers of electric transformers  and motors could gain a major
              competitive lead. In fact, one manufacturer has given substantial commitment.
              In addition this collaborative industry/university research is likely to
              facilitate, an exchange of ideas between academe and industry and enhance the
              educational process of students.
