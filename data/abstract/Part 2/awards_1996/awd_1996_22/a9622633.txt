Abstract    :
              9622633  Gong       The purpose of the proposed workshop is to bring together 
              researchers working on the systems and control issues in  communication
              networks.       The specific objectives are (a) the exchange of research 
              ideas, cross fertilization betweens communication network and  control system
              researchers, and leveraging of complementary  research efforts, (b) technology
              transfer to industry and the  initiation of new dialogues between academic
              researchers and  industrial practitioners, (c) promotion of educational goals 
              through the participation of graduate students, and (d) Promotion  of
              international collaboration in this rapidly developing area.  ***
