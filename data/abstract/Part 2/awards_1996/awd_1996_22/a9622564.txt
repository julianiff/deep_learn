Abstract    :
              9622564    In this project, seven problems in the general context of algebraic
              geometry, quantum cohomology, and their interplay with physics are proposed to
              be investigated.  The main tools are Grothendieck-Knudsen-Mumford determinant
              line bundles over moduli space of Gieseker semistable bundles on algebraic
              surfaces and Gromov-Witten symplectic invariants. The investigation would
              increase the knowledge about the geometry including the quantum cohomology ring
              structure of the moduli space of Gieseker semistable bundles, the S-duality
              conjecture from physics in the form of Vafa and Witten, and the deformation
              type of certain minimal surfaces of general type (a conjecture due to Catanese
              and Reid).    This is research in the field of algebraic geometry.  Algebraic
              geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has
              had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In the origin, it
              treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations,
              namely polynomials.  Nowadays, the field makes use of methods not only from
              algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application
              in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and
              robotics.
