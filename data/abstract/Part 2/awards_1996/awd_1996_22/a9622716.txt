Abstract    :
              9622716  Botez  The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the 
              University of Wisconsin-Madison will purchase a high-resolution  (0.4um) mask
              aligner equipped with backside illumination, which  will be dedicated to
              support research in engineering.  The  equipment will be used for several
              research projects, including in  particular:  high-index-step phase-locked
              arrays of antiguided  diode lasers; monolithically integrated flared-antiguided
              master  oscillator power amplifiers; novel micromachined millimeter-wave 
              antennas and circuits; micromachined devices; and superconducting  vortex flow
              transistors fabricated in high-temperature  superconducting thin films.  ***
