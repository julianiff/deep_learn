Abstract    :
              Joseph  DMI-9622482     Advanced polymeric composite has been used widely for
              aircraft  manufacturing by the defense industry.  In order to utilize these
              materials in the civil sector, manufacturing costs need to be reduced
              dramatically. This research project will develop a modular, layered hybrid
              system framework capable of producing consistently high-quality, low-cost
              composite parts using a variety of composite processes.  The research project
              has a  balance between theory and experiment, and will provide valuable
              findings for the composite manufacturing industry. Results of this research
              project could provide valuable findings in the optimization of existing
              processing equipment for low-cost composite manufacturing.   This research
              project is in close collaboration with industry.
