Abstract    :
                    9622284  Govindjee  The objective of the proposed research is an
              investigation of the  development of material models and their computational 
              realizations for elastomeric composite systems.  Results from  statistical
              physics and rigorous numerical analysis will be used  to develop constitutive
              models that can predict damage and  healing in carbon-black filled elastomers
              in a fashion that is  amenable to large scale inelastic computations.  The
              fundamental  nature of the research is closely linked to applications and 
              industrial interest and the results will have applicability  beyond the
              specific class of material being studied.  ***
