Abstract    :
              Abstract  Latushkin      This project is concerned with asymptotic behavior of
              differential equations and dynamical systems on infinite dimensional Banach
              spaces.  Dichotomy and stability of these equations will be considered, which
              is crucial for the study of long-time evolution of complex systems.  The
              infinite dimensional setting covers equations important for application in
              mechanics and physics.  The core of the proposed approach is to study and apply
              the theory of evolution semigroups.  These semigroups absorb, literally, all
              information needed to develop classical ideas of Lyapunov on stability at the
              level required by modern applications.    Concrete applications include:
              dichotomy for strongly continuous semigroups and for linear nonautonomous
              abstract Cauchy problems on Banach spaces; the hyperbolicity of strongly
              continuous linear skew-product flows on Banach spaces; center manifolds theory
              for infinite dimensional semilinear differential equations; stability in
              non-autonomous linear control theory on Banach spaces; kinematic dynamo
              operator of magnetohydrodynamics for an ideally conducting fluid; and spectral
              properties of the matrix Ruelle operator of statistical physics.
