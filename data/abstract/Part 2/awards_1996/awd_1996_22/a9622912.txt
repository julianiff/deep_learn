Abstract    :
              9622912  Li      The goal of this project is to study enumerative geometry of
              moduli spaces in algebraic geometry.  As the first step, this project will
              investigate how excessive intersection theory based on normal cone construction
              can be applied to study enumerative problems on moduli spaces whose dimensions
              are bigger than their expected dimensions.  Afterward, Li will apply this
              technique to study Gromov-Witten invariants of smooth projective varieties, to
              study enumerative problems of rational curves in Calabi-Yau manifolds and Fano
              varieties and to derive recursion formulas for Donaldson polynomial invariants
              of algebraic surfaces.  Some of them are known using analytic method.  Li
              believes that progress along this line will provide new insight to these
              problems, new technique to attack similar problems and will be a source of good
              mathematical problems in the future.    This is research in the field of
              algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern
              mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
              quarter-century.  In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in
              the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and
              conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in physics,
              theoretical computer science, and robotics.
