Abstract    :
              9622140  The objective of the proposed research program is to develop  practical
               procedures for detection of underground obstacles in the  field by the 
              Spectral-Analysis-of-Surface-Waves (SASW) technique.  Such a  development is 
              important for two major reasons:  1) In urban areas where  subsurface 
              right-of-way is congested, the ability to detect the  position and 
              characteristics of underground obstacles or voids is  important for 
              maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation.  2) This research  will provide 
              guidelines for minimization of the effects of underground  obstacles in SASW 
              site characterization.    Existing experimental and numerical studies indicate
              that  underground  obstacles and soil heterogeneity have significant effects on
               Rayleigh wave  dispersion evaluated by the SASW test.  This research will 
              encompass a  refinement of the numerical model for obstacle detection, 
              verification of  the developed procedures in detection of obstacles in soil 
              systems and  below pavements, and integration of the procedures into  packages
              for an  automated SASW test.  The refinement involves optimization  of the
              procedure  with respect to the number, spacing and placement of  receivers, and
              more  accurate evaluation of some of the obstacle parameters.  Verification and
               implementation of the procedure will be done in the  laboratory and in the 
              field.  Test sites will be selected and prepared in  cooperation with the  New
              Jersey Department of Transportation.  ***
