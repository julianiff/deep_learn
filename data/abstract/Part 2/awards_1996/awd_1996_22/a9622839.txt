Abstract    :
              9622839  Owusu-Ofori  This award is for support of the Third US-Africa
              International Conference on Manufacturing Technology to be held in the city of
              Accra, Ghana in August, 1996.  The goal of the conference is to enable contacts
              between the African researchers and their counterparts in North America with
              the aim of developing mutual cooperation.  The Conference will include both
              invited and contributed sessions on a range of topics related to manufacturing
              technology, including manufacturing management, industrialization and
              technology transfer, and the roles of government, the private sector, and
              academia in industrialization.  A special session is being devoted to
              discussion of opportunities for research collaboration among the different
              countries.  The Conference is an important international meeting and provides
              opportunities for participants from the United States, Africa, and Asia to
              share research ideas and develop strategies for more concrete collaborations. 
              In the long run, the conference should be useful in assisting the development
              of a local research infrastructure that will support an emerging industrial
              base on the African continent.
