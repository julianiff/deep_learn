              CTS - 9622473  Eva Marand  Virginia Poly. Inst & State U.      ABSTRACT      
              The project deals with the development and characterization of polymer-ceramic
              composite membranes.  A highly cross-linked titanate network will be
              incorporated into a polyimide matrix via in-situ polymerization of titanium
              alkoxide.  The formation of hydrogen bonds in the composite enhances
              thermo-mechanical stability and may improve selectivity at higher temperature. 
              Gas transport properties will be correlated to membrane fabrication properties.
               Thermal, spectroscopic and microscopic methods will be used to characterize
              the membranes in terms of stability, microstructure, fractional free volume and
              specific molecular interactions.  Potential applications of the composite
              membranes include high-temperature gas separations and catalysis for chemical
              manufacturing.
