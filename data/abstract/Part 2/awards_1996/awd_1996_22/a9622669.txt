Abstract    :
              9622669  Baumgartner  This REG project develops a multi-functional robotic 
              platform dedicated to a support of research activities in  the areas of
              vision-based robotics for remote planetary  surface operations, precise
              navigation of flexible  manipulators, optimal path planning for flexible-link 
              robots, fault detection and isolation for kinematically  redundant robots, and
              high-performance industrial crane  control. The platform achieves a maximum of
              eight degrees-of-  freedom for manipulators enabling several robotic 
              configurations via locking various joints and exchanging  and/or removing links
              of different stiffness properties,  lengths etc. The project supports the
              acquisition of vision  sensing equipment, computing equipment for control and 
              fabrication of the robotic platform.***
