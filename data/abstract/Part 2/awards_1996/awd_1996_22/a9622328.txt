Abstract    :
              9622328  Wiens   This research equipment grant supports the purchase of
              components and the fabrication of a specialized platform for deburring
              research.   Deburring, particularly when done manually, is an expensive, time
              consuming, but necessary,  part of manufacturing precision parts.  
              Particularly for low to mid volume manufacture, it is an area that is
              attractive for process automation.  However, the technical problems are
              following a contour with a small cutter or abrasive tool, that generate no
              force when there is no burr and a high force when there is a burr.  The idea
              that these investigators want to  test out with this equipment is a synthesis
              of their past separate investigations. One investigation based on kinematics
              theory is a smart kinestatic interactive platform (SKIP), and the other studied
              mechanisms of burr formation and removal.  Their understanding of these two
              areas has led them to an innovative solution of the deburring problem that is
              an integration of the SKIP concept and a deburring process model.     This
              equipment award will provide experimental facilities for research that
              includes: kinematics and dynamics of micro-manipulators for smart deburring,
              edge chamfering and deburring process model based control, and verification of
              an automated finishing system.   ***
