Abstract    :
              9622407  Terry  This is a Research Equipment Grant for the purchase of a very 
              high speed ellipsometer for use in plasma processing/film  thickness analysis. 
              The instrument will be used for research on  the effects of reactive plasma on
              surfaces in reactive ion etch  and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition
              environments.  ***
