Abstract    :
                This two-year award will support dissertation research on  the effects of
              rapidly rising  CO2  concentrations on  terrestrial ecosystems by Cathlyn
              Stylinski at San Diego  State University in cooperation with Dr. Franco
              Miglietta at  the CNR Institute of Agrometeorology and Environmental  Analysis
              for Agriculture in Florence, Italy.  The main  objective of the research is to
              investigate the long-term  effects of elevated CO2 on gas exchange, water
              relations,  and distribution patterns of evergreen and winter-deciduous  oak
              species.  The dissertation project will take place in an  enriched mixed oak
              forest community in Tuscany, Italy, where  a natural CO2 spring has enriched
              CO2 concentrations for  centuries or longer.   CO2 springs provide an
              opportunity to  compare effects from naturally enriched communities to those 
              from previous short-term manipulations using seedlings  and  saplings in
              controlled environments and to observe changes  over different times scales and
              spatial scales.  The  research will benefit from the work of the Italian
              institute  on Italian CO2 springs and from the Principal Investigator's  work
              on the effects of elevated CO2 and climate change on  Mediterranean-type
              ecosystems in such areas as California,  South Africa, Australia, Chile, and
              the Mediterranean Basin.
