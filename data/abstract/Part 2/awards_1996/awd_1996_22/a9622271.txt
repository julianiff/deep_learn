Abstract    :
                  9622271  Cao  This Research Planning Grant provides support for the
              initiation  and detailed evaluation of a program in sheet metal forming, 
              especially on the role of the design and wear of the die that is  to be used. 
              The objective is to examine a die design algorithm  which will permit the
              design of a profile that will reduce  wrinkles and tearing.  If successful,
              this will dramatically  reduce the try out time and cost required for a new
              product  design.  ***
