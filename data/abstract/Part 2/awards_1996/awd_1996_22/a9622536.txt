Abstract    :
              9622536  Karim  This proposal is on research to develop effective means  of
              on-line monitoring, supervision and control of  dissolved oxygen (DO) for a
              variety of fermentation  conditions.  Most fermentation systems are complex, 
              time-varying, and highly nonlinear in nature,  especially in a batch culture
              system, and therefore  control of the important variables can be difficult.  
              It is proposed to use a nonlinear model predictive  control approach by using a
              recursive nonlinear  autoregressive model with an exogenous input (NARX) to 
              approach this problem.  Specific objectives of this  research are to: (1)
              develop a reliable experimental  setup to control DO, (2) develop on-line
              identification  with reliable models, i.e. NARX and adaptive NARX  (ANARX), (3)
              use the identified model to implement  model predictive control, and (4) test
              the NARX and  ANARX based DO controllers in different fermentations,  i.e. both
              low and high density bacterial cell cultures,  including fermentations in the
              presence of two viscous  aqueous phases, and plant cell cultivations which 
              require low shear stress environments.  ***
