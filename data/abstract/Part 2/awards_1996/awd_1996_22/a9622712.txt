Abstract    :
              9622712   Stevens   In this project, laboratory investigations of the kinetics
              of the reaction of isoprene-based peroxy radicals with nitric oxide will be
              performed using both traditional, low-pressure discharge-flow techniques, as
              well as high-pressure flow techniques in a system designed to isolate the
              kinetics of this reaction. These experiments will eventually utilize a variety
              of methods for the detection of reactants and products, in particular,
              laser-induced fluorescence of hydroxyl radical, which will be formed from the
              peroxy radicals of interest. In addition to measuring the rate constant under
              ambient conditions, the experiments will be performed under a wide range of
              pressures and temperatures in order to fully characterize the kinetics of the
              reactions. The results of these experiments will be incorporated into
              atmospheric chemistry models and theoretical studies of fundamental chemical
              reactivity in order to test and improve the current understanding of
              atmospheric oxidation mechanisms.   The study is motivated by recent field
              measurements of radical concentrations and their ratios. Discrepancies between
              measured values of the hydroperoxy/hydroxyl radical concentration ratio have
              been observed, particularly under conditions of low nitric oxide concentration.
              This suggests potential problems in our understanding of the kinetics of the
              reaction between nitric oxide and peroxy radicals, in particularly those
              derived from larger hydrocarbons, such as isoprene. There are few direct
              measurements of the kinetics of these reactions, in particular, none involving
              the isoprene-derived radicals.
