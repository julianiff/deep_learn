Abstract    :
              Dry seasonal tropical forests have received less attention than tropical
              rainforests, but they have been destroyed at a greater rate.  Less than 10% of
              the Mesoamerican seasonal tropical forest remains, so restoration must
              supplement conservation for the protection of biodiversity and ecosystem
              functioning.  Forest restoration experiments will be conducted at two seasonal
              tropical sites in Mexico, the Chamela Ecological Reserve and the El Eden
              Ecological Reserve, to determine the importance of mycorrhizae for successful
              restoration.  Native trees inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi will be planted in
              disturbed sites at both Reserves.  Many types of disturbance deplete the soil
              of nutrients and mycorrhizal inoculum, and mycorrhizae are more beneficial in
              soils that are low in available nutrients.  Inoculating trees with mycorrhizae
              will have a greater impact at the El Eden Reserve where soils are poorer in
              phosphorus.    The principal investigators will use tree species that provide
              local people with food, forage and fiber.  The experiments will provide new
              information on how to reestablish forests that have been devastated by
              conversion to pasture and by wildfire.  In addition, the investigators will
              study tree growth and forest succession, both of which are little understood
              for these forests.
