Abstract    :
              9622709  Donnelly    This proposal contains three separate projects: nodal sets
              of eigenfunctions for higher order elliptic operators; L2 cohomology of the
              Bergman metric, and the Dirichlet problem at infinity for harmonic maps between
              rank one symmetric spaces. For the nodal set project, the investigator proposes
              to find a lower bound for its Hausdorff measure. For the L2 cohomology project,
              he intends to generalize the vanishing theorem for strictly pseudoconvex
              domains to include weakly pseudoconvex domains. For the Dirichlet problem, the
              investigator is interested in providing a counterexample to existence of
              harmonic maps.    The main thrust of this project is the study of Laplacians on
              Riemannian manifolds. Given a Riemannian manifold, that is, a curved space
              possessing a distance function, its Laplacian determines the behavior of a very
              important class of functions defined on the space, namely, harmonic functions.
              Harmonic functions arise in many different contexts: in mathematics, they arise
              as pure and imaginary parts of complex-analytic functions; in applications,
              they describe various heat and wave phenomena.
