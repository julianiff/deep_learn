Abstract    :
              9622326  Thomas       This project is a collaborative effort that will involve
              mechanical and electrical engineers and materials scientists from a university,
              a federal laboratory, and two manufacturing companies.  The research will
              develop techniques to explore microwave cavity design, microwave heating
              patterns, and electromagnetic and thermal measurements and control pertaining
              to continuous processing of thermal runaway materials.  Thermal runaway
              materials are those in which dielectric loss factors increase more rapidly as
              their temperature rises when exposed to a microwave field.  The inability to
              control temperatures during processing prevents widespread use of microwave
              processing for many commercially important materials.       Microwave heating
              offers the possibility for better products at lower cost, increasing the
              international competitiveness of U. S. fiber and chemical industries.  Results
              of this research may be applicable to a wide range of materials, especially
              those made from polymers and ceramics.
