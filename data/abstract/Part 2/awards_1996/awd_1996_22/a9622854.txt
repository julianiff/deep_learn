Abstract    :
                9622854  Papanicolaou    The research is in the following areas: Pulse
              reflection from Random Media   and Radiative Transport, the Focusing
              Singularity of the Nonlinear   Schrodinger Equation, Convection Enhanced
              Diffusion, and Direct and Inverse   Problems for High Contrast Media. In Pulse
              reflection from random media the   goal is to extend the previous work for
              acoustic waves to elastic waves.   It is proposed to get deeper into the study
              of transport approximations for   waves and the derivation of effective
              boundary conditions for the transport   equations.In the Nonlinear Schrodinger
              Equation the goal is to address the   very hard problem of whether or not time
              dispersion prevents the formation   of finite time singularities. In convection
              enhanced diffusion the plans are   to continue the past study convection
              dominated phenomena by considering time   dependent and nonlinear flows and
              using the saddle point variational   principles that proved so useful in the
              previous work by the PI. In the area   of High Contrast Media it is proposed to
              to focus primarily on inverse   problems where linearized inversion schemes are
              not suitable when the   parameters to be estimated have large variations over
              the spatial domain.  %%%    This research is aimed at understanding the
              behavior of complex  materials and environments using advanced mathematical
              modeling  and solution techniques. Applications include seismic imaging  in
              exploration seismology and in a more global environment,  tomographic imaging
              of geophysical environments, turbulent  dispersion of contaminants and related
              problems. This research  is closely related to the applications, and addresses
              specific  issues that arise there, while staying at the cutting edge of  what
              mathematical analysis can do at present and producing  new and interesting
              mathematics.
