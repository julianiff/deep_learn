Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT    CTS-9622178  Goodson  REG    Support was requested for a
              scanning probe microscope and a pulsed Nd:YVO4 laser to be used to control
              temperatures in manufacturing processes at very small length scales. 
              Applications to electronic circuits, MicroElectroMechanical Machines and
              biomedical components are envisioned.
