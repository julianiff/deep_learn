Abstract    :
              9622944  Grosch, Herbert R.  Individual Award    Special Project:  Completion of
              Computing History Memoir     This project provides partial support for the PI
              to develop an historical memoir of his work and observations during the latter
              part of an unusual career in computing, centering on the years 1959-1987,
              during which time he was contributing in a major way to work in Europe and
              Japan and representing the US on various international Committees.  It is
              expected that the material will provide context for current and future work in
              computing and be of benefit to the community.  ***
