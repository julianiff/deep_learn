Abstract    :
              Abstract  Treil/Volberg  DMS-9622963      Treil and Volberg will continue their
              research on bases of classical wavelets in vector weighted spaces.  They will
              consider some classical problems in the theory of Hankel and Toeplitz operators
              in spaces of analytic functions, singular integral operators.  One goal is the
              generalizations of these problems to multi-parameter (vector) setting.   Other
              problems they will investigate are  Sarason's problem about necessary and
              sufficient condition  for a product of two (unbounded) Toeplitz operators to be
              bounded,  description of completely regular multivariate stationary  Gaussian
              processes, two weights inequality for Bergman Projection, and boundedness of a
              product of two (big) Hankel operators in the Bergman space.    Singular
              integrals is one of the main tools analysis brought to applications (signal
              processing, market models, prediction theory, etc..). In practice many such
              problems have a vector (multi-parameter) nature.  The proposed research is
              based on the approach targeting exactly the multi-parameter nature of such
              problems and overcomes the difficulty stemming from this multi-parameter
              nature.  Among the practical applications  of the research are prediction
              theory for stationary Gaussian processes, wavelets (signal processing). The
              authors strongly feel that the developed technique can be helpful.
