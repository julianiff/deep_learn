Abstract    :
              DMS 9622408  RIEDEL       This proposal asks for participant support costs for
              graduate students and younger researchers to attend the Clifford Lectures at
              Tulane University in the Spring of 1996.  This conference will bring together
              researchers in the areas of free entropy and noncommutative probability.    
              Both of these fields are actively funded by NSF and the main speakers holds a 5
              year NSF grant.  The Tulane department is taking an active role with volunteer
              assistance and financial support.
