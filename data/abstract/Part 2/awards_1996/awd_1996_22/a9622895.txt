Abstract    :
              9622895  Wan    This grant supports the work of Professor D. Wan to work in 
              arithmetic geometry specifically problems in the arithmetic of  function
              fields. He intends to study the L-function attached to a  continuos
              representations of the arithmetical fundamental group  of an affine algebraic
              variety defined over a finite field of  characteristic p. He intends to study
              rationality, possible  meromorphic continuations, entireness and the Riemann
              hypothesis   for these L-functions.    This project falls into the general area
              of arithmetic geometry -  a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of
              mathematics:  number theory and geometry. This combination has proved 
              extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that  withstood
              generations.  Among its many consequences are new error  correcting codes. 
              Such codes are essential for both modern  computers (hard disks) and compact
              disks.
