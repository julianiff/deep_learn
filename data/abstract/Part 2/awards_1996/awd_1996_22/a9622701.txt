Abstract    :
              This research project will focus on detailed field measurements and response
              prediction analyses of another large arch dam in China, to study dynamic
              interaction mechanisms of the impounded-water, sediment, and foundation rock
              with the dam.  New areas of investigation include the dam-water-sediment
              interaction effects with respect to the sediment properties and sediment
              thickness, effects of canyon topography on the free-field ground motions, and
              improved dynamic excitation techniques.  The basic concept in the field
              measurements is to excite the dynamic response of the dam and its retained
              water by detonating explosive charges.  Two types of explosion tests will be
              employed:  those applied to the foundation rock and those detonated in the lake
              water.  In addition, two approaches based on the seismic reflection and
              refraction techniques will be employed to measure the reflection coefficient of
              the lake-bottom materials.  The proposed test program will provide improved
              understanding of the actual dynamic response behavior of arch dams influenced
              by the interaction with the impounded-water and the foundation rock; by the
              energy absorption of the lake-bottom materials; by the lake topography; and by
              the spatial variations of ground motion around the canyon.  Results of the
              proposed research should lead to better understanding of the dam-water-sediment
              and dam-foundation interaction effects, and will provide measured data by which
              the accuracy of computer programs for analyzing the earthquake response of arch
              dams can be examined and possibly improved.
