Abstract    :
                Mukherjee  9622114         Electronic and optical thin film production
              currently relies on techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), chemical
              vapor deposition, sputtering, liquid phase epitaxy, ion beam deposition, and
              thermal evaporation. The research is to study the interaction of the CO2 laser
              with the target as well as the effect of inter-pluse delay of the temporal
              shaping on the coupling of the CO2 laser energy to the excimer laser-ablated
              plume.   Both theorical and experimental models will be studied to optimize the
              process parameters.  To assess the flexibility of the proposed dual-laser
              process as a manufacturing method, three diferent materials, including Lithium
              Niobate, High Temperature Superconductor, and Amorphous rare earth-transition
              metal alloys will be investigated.       The outcome of this research project
              would allow the development of a database for the general applicability of this
              technique, thus the realization of the use of pulsed laser deposition (PLD) for
              manufacturing could be achieved. The outcomes of the study would yield useful
              tools and models to develop a novel manufacturing technique which combine the
              merits of molecular epitaxy technology and single source deposition
