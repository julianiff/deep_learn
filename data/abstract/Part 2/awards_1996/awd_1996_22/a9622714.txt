Abstract    :
              9622714  Ponte-Castaneda  This project will study the evolution of
              microstructural  changes during finite deformations of heterogeneous 
              materials.  Internal variables will be used to characterize  the current state
              of the microstructure.  These internal  variables will be governed by
              incremental relations.  Special attention will be given to shear loadings which
               frequently are neglected in earlier models.  Several  problems in the area of
              metal forming and ductile fracture  will be analyzed.  These models are
              expected to be  applicable to porous and particle reinforced aluminum.  ***
