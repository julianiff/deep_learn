Abstract    :
              9622876    This award supports the research of Professor K. Goodearl to work in
              non-commutative ring theory with special emphasis on problems arising from the
              theory of Quantum Groups. In particular, Professor Goodearl will continue to
              investigate analogies between Quantum Groups and enveloping algebras of
              solvable Lie algebras concentrating on the non-root-of-unity case.     This is
              research in the subfield of algebra called non-commutative ring theory. Algebra
              can be though of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As such, algebra has
              direct applications to areas of physics and chemistry. In fact, much of
              non-commutative ring theory generalizes structures found in Quantum Mechanics
              and this proposal continues to explore areas that connect directly with modern
              quantum field theory.
