Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    CATE  9622318    This Interagency Agreement supports activities of
              the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC) for which NSF has lead
              agency role.  These activities involve editing and preparation of the camera
              copy of the Spring and Fall 1996 and 1997 issues of the Journal, Arctic
              Research of the United State.  The Journal serves an essential step in
              fulfilling the requirements of Public Law 98-373, the Arctic Research and
              Policy Act.  It contains information on research activities of the Federal
              agencies involved in the Arctic and reports and minutes of meetings from the
              Arctic Research Commission and IARPC.  This action provides support for
              preparation of the Journal and documentation of the interagency programs.
