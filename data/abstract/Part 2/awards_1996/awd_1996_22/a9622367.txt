Abstract    :
                9622367  Golden  We propose to develop new analytical and numerical techniques
                for investigating the behavior of a number of percolation models   arising in
              the study of high contrast composite materials.   Some of the directions for
              development include:  (i) exploring the critical behavior of the random
              resistor network  in light of a new, direct correspondence with the Ising
              model,  (ii) analysis of continuum percolation models for porous media   and
              matrix-particle composites, (iii) developing a diagnostic   method for
              non-destructively telling whether one phase in a   composite percolates or not,
              which could have applications to   the detection of material failure or quality
              control for composite   manufacturing, and (iv) modeling the transport of heat
              and brine   through sea ice, a porous medium.  %%%  A broad range of problems
              in materials science involve composites   which can be characterized by a high
              contrast in the properties of   the components. For such media, the effective
              behavior is often   dominated by the connectedness, or percolation properties
              of a   particular phase. Examples include porous media, doped semiconductors,  
              smart materials such as piezoresistors and thermistors, thin metal   films
              (used in solar energy production), oil bearing sandstones,   fracture patterns
              in rocks and metals, many structures in the human   body, and sea ice (which
              plays a major role in climate and is an   indicator of global change). In the
              proposed work we will study   mathematical models of such materials. We
              anticipate that this project   will further our capabilities to predict the
              effective behavior of   naturally occurring or artificially made complex random
              materials,   as well as aid the development of composites designed to achieve
              novel  or optimal properties.   ***
