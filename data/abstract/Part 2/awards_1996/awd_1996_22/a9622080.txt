Abstract    :
                The project is a continuation of research focused on a combination  of
              data-analysis using multi-point observations of magnetospheric  substorm
              phenomena and theoretical development of a substorm onset  mechanism involving
              plasma instabilities.  Analysis will focus on  isolated substorms using data
              from the ground based arrays, the  suite of ISTP satellites as well as others
              not in the ISTP program  such as DMSP.  The analysis will focus on the
              conversion of  magnetic field energy to particle kinetic energy during the 
              expansion phase and the temporal and spatial relations of events  observed on
              the ground and in space.  Results will be utilized to  evaluate various
              substorm models and to guide the theoretical  development of the expansion
              onset mechanism.
