Abstract    :
              We propose to identify the physical and biological mechanisms responsible for
              restoration of damaged streams.  Specifially, we will determine whether an
              increase in the diversity of physical habitat types on a streambed promotes
              restoration of a stream ecosystem following a perturbation.  Further, we will
              assess how flooding interacts with habitat diversity to impede or promote
              ecosystem recovery following damage.  We will physically partition multiple
              sections of a stream into paired halves (one control and one restoration
              treatment), disturb treatment halves, and then alter the size and complexity of
              the streambed substrate in the treatments halves.  We will measure physical and
              biological responses to the disturbance and to the restoration treatments, and
              determine when and how the disturbed sections "recover."   Recovery will be
              estimated as the similarity between biological diversity and ecosystem function
              in control and treatment sections of the stream.    This experiment mimics
              restoration methods currently used by state and national environmental
              management groups.  These methods have never been evaluated scientifically to
              determine if (and why) they enhance restoration of damaged stream ecosystems. 
              Our experiment will also test a central ecological question of broad relevance
              to environmental science: does increasing physical habitat diversity enhance
              species diversity and ecosystem function?                  ??
