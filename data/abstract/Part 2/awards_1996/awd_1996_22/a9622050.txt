Abstract    :
                                               ABSTRACT  Dwight Look  9622050      Support was
              requested for an argon-ion laser to be used in anisotropic scattering
              experiments important in radiative heat transfer applications. 
              Multidimensional experiments using latex particles suspended in distilled water
              would provide data for both optically thick and thin media.  The grant was
              supported under the Research Equipement Grant Program.
