Abstract    :
                  9622308  Tommelein  The main objective of this research is to develop a
              methodology and  computer tools for field engineers to manage the flow of
              materials  and equipment on site, in order to raise the overall productivity 
              of the construction process.  Planning the temporary storage layout  and
              handling of materials greatly affects a project's overall  productivity.  It
              therefore critically determines the contractor's  profitability and thus his
              competitiveness in the global market  place.  The advent of new technologies
              (including wireless  electronic data exchange, laser-based spatial positioning
              systems,  and palmtop computers aka).  Personal Digital Assistants or PDAs 
              combined with new management philosophies (including just-in-time  vs.
              just-in-case and lean production) open up a wide range of  possibilities to
              improve the construction materials management  process.  Accordingly, this
              research plans to investigate their  applicability and test how they can be
              used to achieve the greatest  improvements.
