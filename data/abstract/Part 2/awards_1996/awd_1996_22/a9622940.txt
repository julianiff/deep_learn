Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to evaluate the seismic vulnerability of a
              bridge through analysis of the entire bridge structure.  The data obtained in
              the 1995 Hyogoken-Nanbu earthquake provide a unique opportunity for researchers
              to evaluate the performance of bridge structures under severe earthquake loads
              and to advance the state-of-the-art analysis methods for reinforced concrete
              bridges.  In pursuit of this objective , a joint U.S.-Japan-Europe research
              program is formulated.  The research tasks are (1) development of viable
              analysis techniques for assessing the seismic vulnerability of  bridge
              structures; (2) investigation of the cause of failure of a selected reinforced
              concrete bridge in the Hyogoken-Nanbu earthquake; (3) evaluation of the
              performance of reinforced concrete bridges which reflect the current and older
              designs in the respective countries under the strong ground motions recorded in
              the Hyogoken-Nanbu earthquake; and (4) comparison of bridge designs in the
              respective countries.  To this end, systematic analyses will be carried out at
              the local pier level as well as at the system level for several bridge
              structures.  The study will be carried out in a complementary and yet
              independent manner by each group.  This study will result in a better
              understanding of the behavior of  reinforced concrete highway bridge systems
              under strong earthquake ground motions, and will provide viable analysis
              methods which can be used to evaluate the local as well as global performance
              of bridge structures.  These analysis tools can be used to evaluate the seismic
              vulnerability of bridge structures in a rational and definitive manner, and, in
              the future, to evaluate the efficiencies of various seismic retrofit
              techniques.  The lessons learned from the Hyogoken-Nanbu earthquake and the
              comparison of different design practices will provide information that can be
              used to further improve design provisions on bridges.
