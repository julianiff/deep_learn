Abstract    :
              9622497  Fraser    This is a study of the role of a number of intrinsic and 
              extrinsic factors, including chemical and microstructural  effects, on the
              deformation mechanisms operative in titanium  aluminide-based systems.  The
              objectives of this research  are fourfold: (1) one aim is to determine the
              anisotropy of  the bonding charge densities in titanium aluminide (TiAl)  and
              assess its influence on deformation processes.  Accurate  values of the
              Debye-Waller factors are determined on  standard samples of known compositions
              using four-circle x-  ray diffraction.  Subsequently, low-order structure
              factors  for TiAl are deduced from which the anisotropy of bonding  charge
              densities are assessed.  The possible influence of  the resulting charge
              densities on deformation mechanisms are  then assessed.  (2) the effects of
              both substitutional and  interstitial solute additions on dislocation
              mobilities are  determined.  Here, experiments are performed on single phase 
              samples of TiAl to develop an understanding of the  interaction between oxygen
              impurities and dislocations in  TiAl.  (3) an assessment of the role of Ti3Al
              on the  deformation behavior and micro-mechanisms of fracture in  TiAl-based
              systems is made.  The deformation behavior of  Ti3Al in lamellar, equiaxed and
              duplex versions of the  microstructures is determined by post-mortem
              transmission  electron microscopy (TEM) studies, with particular emphasis 
              being placed on slip transmission through Ti3Al, and the  accumulation of
              strain at interfaces between TiAl and Ti3Al.  (4) the ability to engineer
              interface properties in TiAl-  based systems by solute addition, in an
              analogous manner to  that in Ni-base superalloys, is investigated.  %%%  The
              research examines deformation mechanisms in titanium  aluminide alloys, whose
              practical applications are limited  by a lack of understanding of a number of
              important factors  related to their mechanical behavior.  The effort also 
              contributes to the scientific base for elevated temperature  interme tallic
              compounds.  ***
