Abstract    :
              9622700  Slatkin   The Northern Elephant Seal, Mirounga angustirostris,
              possesses a unique demographic history among mammals: reduction to near
              extinction followed by exponential population growth. This bottleneck was
              accompanied by a reduction in genetic variation which has hampered efforts to
              use genetic markers to study Elephant Seal population biology. In the research
              funded by this award, microsatellite loci characterized by extreme variability
              and high mutation rates will be used to overcome this problem.  The specific
              goals of the research are to study the evolution of microsatellite loci by
              exploiting the demographic history of the Northern Elephant Seal,  to develop a
              method for monitoring immune system variation in the Northern Elephant Seal,
              and to use microsatellite markers to study the genetic and social structure of
              seal populations.    Findings will provide clues as to why a species with so
              little genetic variation is doing so well demographically. The  markers
              developed for use in studying Northern Elephant Seal population and social
              structure will also serve as tools to measure migration and mating behavior,
              two underlying determinants of genetic diversity. This research represents an
              early application of methods developed by genome researchers to the study of a
              protected natural population with important conservation implications.
