Abstract    :
                      Depletion of stratospheric ozone,  particularly in the polar regions, is
              causing increased concern over the effects of harmful UV radiation (mainly UVB,
              280-320 nm).  UVB is damaging to many biological processes, and in plants,
              specifically targets photosynthesis.  Large increases in the penetration of
              solar UVB in the Southern Ocean during the austral spring from ozone depletion
              is known to have significant effects on phytoplankton productivity. The
              phenomenon is less severe in the Arctic, but ozone related increases in
              incident UVB have accelerated over the last three years.  This proposal
              addresses the question of the effects of increased UVB on large benthic marine
              macroalgae (kelp) and the levels of UVB that penetrates into the coastal water
              of the Arctic.    Little is known about the sensitivity of kelp photosynthesis
              to UVB.  Assessment of UV effects (280-400  nm) in an environmental context 
              can be made by weighting the spectrum of UV irradiance with a biological
              weighting function (BWF; similar to an action spectrum).  The investigators
              will measure detailed BWF's and the kinetics of UV effects n photosynthesis of
              macroalgae in High Arctic, emphasizing the kelps, Laminaria saccharina and L.
              solidungula, which are distributed throughout the circumpolar Arctic.  Both
              laboratory cultured plants and sporophytes collected during two spring and one
              summer field season in the Canadian High Arctic (Resolute, 79o30' N; 95oW) will
              be measured.  Plants exposed to different natural light environments during the
              nine-month ice covered period will be examined for difference in their
              sensitivity to UV radiation; the importance of the nitrogen status of the
              plants in recovery processes that counteract UV-induced damage will also be
              investigated. The results will enable the first quantification of potential UV
              exposure in kelp habitats and the biological effects of such exposure in terms
              of kelp productivity in arctic coastal systems.
