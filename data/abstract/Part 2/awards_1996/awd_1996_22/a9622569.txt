Abstract    :
              AST 9622569                             ABSTRACT          The  University  of 
              Arizona proposes to build  an  11-  element,  SIS heterodyne array  receiver 
              for use on  the 10  meter  University  of Arizona/Max Planck Institute for 
              Radioastronomy (MPIfR) Heinrich  Hertz Telescope (HHT). The  array will be
              designed for operation in the 870 pm  atmospheric window, with a tuning range
              from 315 to 380 Ghz,  one of the richest  regions in the submillimeter portion
              of  the spectrum. The  870 pm  window  also  has  the  highest  atmospheric 
              transmission  of  any submillimeter  band. An array designed  for this
              wavelength  range  will make   excellent  use  of  the  telescope,  the 
              available  atmospheric transmission,  and provide a new perspective on stellar,
              chemical,  and  galaxy evolution in the present as well as past epochs.        
                   The array receiver will use SIS waveguide  receivers in an efficient,
              compact  optical  system. The  array is divided into two,  independently tuned,
              hexagonally  packed subarrays with orthogonal polarizations.  The  subarrays
              are physically arranged so that their beams, when  combined on a  wire  grid,
              appear interleaved on the sky.  The field-of-view of  the array is 76" x 88".
              The separation  between adjacent pixels is at most ~ 19".  The  tuning and 
              control of the array receiver will be  completely automated.            
              Funding will be used to build the array receiver  "front-end",  which includes 
              the optics, mixers, cryostat,  local oscillators,  and  cooled I.F. 
              amplifiers.  Each  array channel will have from 500 MHz (435 km/s) to 2 GHz 
              (1740 km/s) of available bandwidth. The corresponding  spectral resolutions are
              0.053 and 0.85 km/s respectively.  Such a large range in instantaneous
              bandwidth and spectral  resolution will make the array  an excellent  probe  of
               velocity fields in a wide range  of  astronomical objects,  from cold clouds
              to edge-on, high-redshift galaxies.
