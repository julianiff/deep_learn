Abstract    :
              Abstract  Ralston/Eskin  9622310    In this proposal we present several inverse
              coefficient problems  which we plan to attack using the methods introduced in
              our paper   (Commun. Math. Phys.173 (1995)). In most cases we wish to recover
              the   unknown coefficients from scattering data (or equivalently the  
              Dirichlet to Neumann map) at a fixed energy. The coefficients are   usually
              assumed to approach limiting values exponentially, but are not   necessarily
              constant outside compact sets. The equations we plan to   study are the
              Schroedinger equation with an external gauge potential,   the Laplace-Beltrami
              equation for a metric which tends exponentially to   the Euclidean metric,
              Maxwell's equations, and the Schroedinger   equation with magnetic and electric
              potentials in two space dimensions.    Inverse scattering problems arise when
              one wishes to recover physical  properties of an object from data obtained by
              remote observations.   Interpreted broadly these problems include methods of
              nondestructive   testing and medical imaging. The problems we propose to study
              include   recovering the electrical properties of a medium from signals sent  
              through it, and the reconstruction of the forces acting on a quantum   particle
              from the observation of the deflection of its trajectories.
