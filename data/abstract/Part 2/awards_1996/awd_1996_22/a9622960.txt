Abstract    :
              We will study applications of Index Theory and Coarse Geometry  to orbifolds and
              Z_k-manifolds.  In particular we  will carry out a preliminary investigation of
               the following two questions  (1) Index Theory on complete orbifolds and Z_k
              manifolds  (2) E-theoretical Index Theory for orbifolds and Z_k-manifolds
