Abstract    :
              9622323  Kiremidjian  This is an equipment grant for support of upgrading of the
               seismic shaking table facility at the John A. Blume  Earthquake Engineering
              Center, Stanford University.  The  table  which was built in 1972 has been in
              continuous use  for testing of variety of structures and components and 
              significant results have been obtained over that period of  time.  Many of the
              important components of the shaking table  facility have deteriorated while
              others have become  obsolete.    This project to modernize and upgrade key
              components of the  shaking table facility.  The replacement components to be 
              purchased and installed include: hydrostatic Bearings with  Suction Pump, and
              PC-Based Control System for Table  Programming and Data Acquisition.    The
              shaking table facility upgrading is a part of the on-  going University's
              program seismically to seismicaly  retrofit and expand the Center at a cost of
              $3.5 million.  This modernization is a unique opportunity to renovate and 
              update the key laboratory equipment, its shaking table,  consistent with
              CMS/ENG's concept and long-term plans to  upgrade and network the nation's
              earthquake experiment  research capability.  ***
