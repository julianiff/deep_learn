Abstract    :
              In this accomplishment-based renewal in the Inorganic, Organometallic and  
              Bioinorganic Chemistry Program, Dr. Margerum will continue mechanistic  
              studies of non-metal redox reactions with emphasis on rapid reactions   between
              electrophilic halogen species and nucleophiles with nitrogen,   oxygen, sulfur
              and halogen donors.  The role of halogen-cation transfer   mechanisms, the
              correlation of reactivities with nucleophilicity, and the   effect of acid-base
              catalysis in these reactions will be examined.    Halogen oxidations of
              ammonia, hydrazine, and hydroxylamine, the reaction   of chloramine with
              formaldehyde, reactions between bromamine and   formaldehyde, reactions of
              N-fluoro electrophilic fluorinating reagents   with inorganic nucleophiles, and
              reactions of highly reactive   Ni(III)peptide complexes will be studied.  The
              use of a   pulsed-accelerated-flow, position-resolved observation instrument  
              developed in Margerum's laboratories makes it possible to measure   extremely
              fast reaction rates.   In this work Dr. Margerum will study atom- and
              ion-transfer reactions   which take place more rapidly than can be measured by
              conventional   methods.  The unique instrumentation developed in the PI's
              laboratory   provides the opportunity to measure these extremely fast
              reactions, which   have fundamental, environmental and biological significance.
