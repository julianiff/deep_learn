Abstract    :
              9622761  Leckband  This proposal is a request for funding for a surface  force
              apparatus facility with capabilities for both  normal and shear force
              measurements.  The objective is  to establish a molecular force measurement
              facility  that will enable researchers in materials and surface  science to
              directly measure the molecular surface  forces associated with well-defined
              chemistries and  structures of material surfaces.  Such measurements  will
              facilitate: (1) determinations of the fundamental  relationships between
              molecular composition,  structure/organization, and the molecular forces that 
              ultimately control material interactions, and (2)  direct testing of theories
              that describe these  interrelationships.
