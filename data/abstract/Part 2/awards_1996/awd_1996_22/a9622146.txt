Abstract    :
              9622146  Reimanis  This Research Equipment Grant will allow the Center for
              Advanced  Ceramics at the Colorado School of Mines to purchase a high vacuum 
              hot press which is essential for several research projects in  Ceramic
              Engineering and in Materials Science.  This equipment is  clearly needed by the
              investigator to develop fully-dense ceramics  for research studies on ceramics
              and composites.  The research  studies on ceramic synthesis and metal/ceramic
              functionally graded  materials are important and novel research topics.  PI has
              a strong  record of quality research and has demonstrated competence in his 
              studies of the failure of ceramics.  In addition to research  studies the
              equipment will be available to undergraduate students  for educational
              purposes.  The institutional cost-share of 50% of  the project costs will come
              from a State of Colorado capital  equipment grant for the renovation and
              construction of the  Metallurgical and Materials Engineering building at the
              Colorado  school of Mines.  ***
