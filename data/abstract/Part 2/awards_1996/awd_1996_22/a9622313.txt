Abstract    :
              9622313  Federici  The Departments of Physics and Electrical Engineering at New
              Jersey  Institute of Technology will purchase an Argon Ion laser, water
              chiller,  second harmonic generator, and an autocorrelator and long wavelength
              mirror  set for a Ti:Sapphire laser which will be dedicated to support research
              in  engineering. The equipment will be used for several research projects, 
              including in particular:    * Far-infrared pump/probe spectroscopy of wide
              bandgap semiconductors.    * Photoinduced superconductivity and defects in
              YBCO.    * Surface roughness measurement for ultra-thin silicon wafer direct
              bonding.    * Time-resolved studies of lifetime and nonlinearity of nano-size  
                 semiconductor clusters.    * Education/Course development for Undergraduate
              and Graduate Students.  ***
