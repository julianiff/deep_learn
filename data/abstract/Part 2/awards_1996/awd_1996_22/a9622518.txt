Abstract    :
              DMI-9622518      Malshe         Chemical Vapor Deposited (CVD) diamond
              deposition has enhanced the operating performance  of many existing
              technological systems for the electronics, optical, computer and mechanical
              industries.  Previously, energy sources such as ions, abrasive, and chemical
              was considered for post-synthesis finishing and machining of CVD-diamond films.
               These techniques inevitably lead to contamination and damage to the surfaces
              and subsurface layers as residual stresses, chemicals residues, and defects. 
              Many of these techniques were based on applying a solid, liquid, or gas polish
              directly on the substrate.  The results of these techniques are slow, thereby
              resulting in damage and deterioration.          This research develops and
              investigates a novel femtosecond (fs) pulse laser processing  technique for
              ultrafine machining of CVD-diamond films and other CVD-diamond based
              components.  The investigators proposes that the right combination of
              ultraviolet (UV) wavelength, pulse width, and processing environment with this
              novel approach will not only refine existing laser-processing techniques, but
              also surpass all other existing processing techniques in their physico-chemical
              machining performances.  The research task is in collaboration with the Iowa
              State University.
