Abstract    :
              9622821  Ataai  This proposal is on research which addresses one of the 
              bottlenecks in protein production frequently reported  for recombinant E. coli,
              namely overflow production of  semi-oxidized sugars and carbohydrates (e.g.
              acetate)  which reduces the total carbon yield and also indicates  inefficient
              metabolic biosynthetic/catabolic fluxes.   The specific goals of this research
              are to: (1) build  on the investigators' Bacillus research to  experimentally
              validate (using NMR) the feasibility of  optimized flux distribution centered
              around pyruvate  kinase (PYK), (2) transfer the yield-increasing  strategy to
              E. coli by deleting PYK isozymes and  analyze via metabolic flux analysis,
              again coupled with  NMR, (3) determine scale-up potential in terms of  mutant
              E. coli concentration, recombinant protein  production, and oxygen consumption,
              and, (4) evaluate  whether there is a link between energy-consuming 
              proteolysis and ATP-generation as shown in high glucose  feed E. coli cultures.
