Abstract    :
              Abstract - Kosanovich - 9622387      The Department of Chemical Engineering at
              the University of South Carolina will purchase on four processor Sun SPARC
              station 20 workstation and one three PSRC Xterminal which will be dedicated to
              support research in Chemical Engineering.  The high performance computing
              environment will be used for research in the areas of process modeling,
              optimization, and system identification as applied to anaerobic fixed-film
              processes and semi-batch filtration processes.  Specifically, it will be used
              primarily for two research projects:  (1) nonlinear parameter estimation and
              optimum operability policy determination for a fixed-film biological wastewater
              treatment process and (2) system identification of a semi-batch filtration
              process.  In addition, the computing environment will advance and improve the
              quality, and broaden the scope of research and education in the basic areas of
              process design, dynamic modeling, and optimization.
