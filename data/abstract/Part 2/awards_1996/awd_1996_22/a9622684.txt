              Abstract  ATM-9622684  Le, Jianning  University of South Carolina  Title:
              Climate Variability of Northeast Pacific/Western North              American:
              Sub-millennial Scale Marine and Terrestrial               Evidence from Santa
              Barbara Basin    This award supports a project that is designed to study sub- 
              millennial scale natural climate variability during two major warm  events at
              the beginning of the last glacial cycle.  The project  focuses on the rapidly
              deposited sediments ( 100cm/kyr) recovered  from ODP Site 893 in Santa Barbara
              Basin.  The approach will be to  examine both marine and terrestrial indicators
              of climate change  using subsets of the same sediment samples, thus allowing
              for  direct comparison of changes in the rate and amplitude of the  response of
              these two interrelated ecosystems to global climate  change.  Marine plankton
              (foraminifera and radiolaria) and pollen  in sediments deposited between 65 to
              108kyr at approximately 100-  200 year intervals will be analyzed.  Results of
              this study will  lead to more rigorous validation of models of present climate 
              change and improvement in our understanding of the interaction  between low-
              and high-frequency climate processes and associated  forcing mechanisms.
