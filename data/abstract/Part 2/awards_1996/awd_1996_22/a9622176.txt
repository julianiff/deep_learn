Abstract    :
              9622176  Malley    The Total Organic Carbon (TOC) analyzer with autosampler 
              requested in this proposal will be used for several ongoing  research in the
              areas of environmental engineering such as:  "An Evaluation of UV for
              Disinfection of Groundwater and its  Effect on Biological Regrowth in
              Distribution Systems";  "Role of Protozoa in an Organically-Contaminated
              Subsurface  Environment".  "Bioremediation of Alaskan Soils Contaminated  with
              Petroleum Hydrocarbons"; The Effect of Natural Organic  Matter and Iron on
              Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) in Radon  Removal from Drinking Water". 
              Evaluating GAC Sandwich  Modifications to a Slow Sand Filtration Facility"; 
              "Treatability of Natural Organic Matter from the Croton  Reservoir - New York
              City"; and "Fundamental Research on the  Mechanisms of the WES-Phix Process in
              Eight Waste  Materials."  In each of these projects, low levels of  organic
              carbon play a fundamental role in the biological,  chemical and/or physical
              processes that are occurring  in  the environmental engineering system being
              studied.  The TOC  analyzer will quantify these low levels and detect small 
              changes in the organic carbon that may impact each system's  engineering
              behavior.
