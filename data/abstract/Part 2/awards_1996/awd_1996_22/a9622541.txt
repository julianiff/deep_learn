Abstract    :
              9622541  GOAD         The University of Michigan will operate R/V LAURENTIAN
              during  1996 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded 
              research projects.  The LAURENTIAN is an 80' general research  vessel
              constructed in 1974 and owned by the University of Michigan.   The ship is
              scheduled for 60 operating days in 1993, of which 42  days are in support of
              NSF-sponsored programs.  The ship operates  primarily in the Great Lakes.      
                This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science  Foundation to
              support oceanographic research projects.  Most  oceanographic research projects
              require highly specialized  equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew
              members.  An  increasing number of research projects require equipment that
              must  be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship must be 
              specifically designed.  Such equipment also requires highly trained  crew
              members for maintenance and operation.  These vessels do not  operate in the
              same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and  therefore, NSF supports
              the operation of a variety of vessels  specifically dedicated to oceanographic
              research.  These vessels  are operated by universities and research
              institutions around the  country.          The R/V LAURENTIAN is a capable
              vessel for the work proposed.   The program considers the ship important part
              of the fleet due to  its location.  The Laurentian is the only UNOLS vessel
              that  operates in the Great Lakes, and the University of Michigan should  be
              encouraged to improve usage of the vessel.
