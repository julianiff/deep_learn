Abstract    :
              9622556  Vaaler     This grant supports the research of Professors J. Vaaler to
              work on problems in effective measures for approximations of algebraic numbers.
              He hopes to extend techniques recently discovered for effective measures in
              cubic fields to fields of higher degree. He hopes to do this by searching for
              an improved multivariate form of Dyson's lemma.     This is research in the
              field of number theory.  Number theory starts with the whole numbers and
              questions such as the divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among
              the oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely
              aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century, it has become an
              essential tool in developing new algorithms for computer science and new error
              correcting codes for electronics.  ??
