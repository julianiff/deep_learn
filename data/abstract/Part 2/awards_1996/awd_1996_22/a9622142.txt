Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9622142    A state-of-the-art, solid-state, three-channel nuclear
              magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer is assembled from existing
              superconducting magnets and a computer workstation and component parts acquired
              from this award.  The spectrometer is intended for research on mechanisms of
              chemical reactions in solid acids, including adsorption complexes formed in
              industrially important reactions in zeolites.
