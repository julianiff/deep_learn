Abstract    :
              9622084  Deuermeyer  This research focuses on the development of new simulation
              theory and methods to improve the performance and effectiveness of discrete
              simulation as it applies to semiconductor manufacturing.  Planners and
              designers are becoming more interested in using cycle time to plan equipment
              purchases and scheduling policies; discrete-event simulation is the only
              analysis tool currently available to support design activities.  Specific
              improvements in simulation methodology are needed for 1) faster execution
              speed, 2) methods to obtain cycle-time estimators, and 3)special
              variance-reduction technology that accounts for the increase in variability in
              cycle time caused by preventive maintenance and rare failure events. 
              Generalized Semi-Markov Processes (GSMP) will be used as the modeling
              framework.     This research will provide new capabilities in generating sample
              paths of GSMPs, developing importance sampling schemes for GSMPs, developing
              methods for computing crossing probabilities of cycle time and developing
              software to demonstrate the theoretical methods.  These should contribute
              significantly toward solutions to the demanding problems in analysis and design
              of the extremely complex processes associated with semiconductor wafer fabs
              from the point of view of product cycle time and throughput rates, and facility
              and machine capacity.
