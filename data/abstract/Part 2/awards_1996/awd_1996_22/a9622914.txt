Abstract    :
              DMS-9622914  PI:  William Ross  University of Richmond     The principal
              investigator will conduct research on operators   on spaces of analytic
              functions. Such problems explore the   relationship between functional analysis
              and complex function  theory. The first part of the proposal examines the
              invariant   subspaces of the "backward shift operator" on a general Hilbert 
              space of analytic functions. In the second part of the proposal,  the principal
              investigator plans to examine the Bergman space  on a "crescent" domain and
              examine certain subspaces which are  invariant under the linear transformation
              "multiplication by z".  In the third part of the proposal, the principal
              investigator   plans to look at the closure of the polynomials on the  
              "standard crescent" (the region bounded by two internally   tangent circles).  
                  As mentioned earlier, these types of problems combine two   fields of
              mathematics, functional analysis and complex function   theory. This link was
              first noticed by Arne Beurling in 1949   in his seminar paper on the shift
              operator. Further results on the   shift were taken up by several Russians such
              as Korenblum,   Nikolskii, Havin, Shirokov, and Shamoyan.   In this proposal we
              examine these same problems but will pay closer  attention to the geometry
              involved.
