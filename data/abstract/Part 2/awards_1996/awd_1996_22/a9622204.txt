Abstract    :
              CTS - 9622204  T. Mountziaris  SUNY Buffalo    ABSTRACT       The project
              involves the purchase of a high-performance computer (server) to extend and
              upgrade the capacities of an existing workstation cluster.  The computer will
              serve the computational needs of the research groups of five professors. 
              Research projects that will benefit cover various topics including thin film
              technology, design of configurationally tailored media for application in
              catalysis and separations, reaction and transport in evolving biphasic media,
              molecular simulation to predict thermophysical properties, and inverse problems
              involving complex dynamical systems.  The server will also be useful for
              interacting with the national supercomputing centers.  It will encourage
              graduate education by allowing the integration of advanced computational
              techniques, molecular simulation and interactive visualization into the
              graduate curriculum.
