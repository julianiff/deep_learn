Abstract    :
              Gieseker  DMS 96-22905    This awards supports the research of Professor D.
              Gieseker to  work on the algebraic geometry of difference equations. He hopes 
              to apply techniques of algebraic geometry to various nonlinear  equations
              usually arising from physics. In this proposal he  intends to concentrate on
              the KP and Davey-Stewartson equations.   What he hopes to do is discretize the
              continuous linear operator  so that the associated linear problem admits
              isospectral  deformations..    This research is in the field of algebraic
              geometry, one of the  oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which
              blossomed to  the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems 
              that have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures  defined in the
              plane by the simplest of equations, namely  polynomials. Today, the field uses
              methods not only from algebra,  but also from analysis and topology, and
              conversely it is  extensively used in those fields.  Moreover it has proved
              itself  useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer  science,
              cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
