Abstract    :
              9622213  German    This award supports the acquisition of two instruments which 
              analyze oxygen/nitrogen and carbon/sulfur content in  engineering materials. 
              The presence of these four elements  can have far-reaching effects on the
              microstructure,  mechanical properties, thermal properties, and electronic 
              behavior of engineering materials, especially when they are  used as powders. 
              When dealing with powdered metals and  ceramics, the processing, sintering, and
              post-sintering  properties are often controlled by the surface chemistry of 
              the starting material.  Elements such as carbon, nitrogen,  sulfur, and oxygen
              are known to concentrate on particle  surfaces.  Thus, the ability to detect
              their presence and  quantify the amount of each that is present is crucial to 
              understanding the final properties of the material.  This  equipment will
              provide envaluable information on many areas  of powder processing including: 
              (1) The effect of sintering  atmosphere on the mechanical properties of high
              performance  alloys; (2) Binder selection for the processing of  particulate
              materials; (3) The effect of powder chemistry on  the thermal behavior of
              materials; (4) Oxide growth; and (5)  Fundamental microstructural studies.  %%%
               The acquisition of this analytical equipment will add an  important facet to
              this advanced microstructural analysis  facility.  Now, the microstructural and
              mechanical property  data can be directly linked with the alloy chemistry. 
              Once  a database has been established with this information, it  will be
              possible to design alloys with very specific  microstructures and properties
              without having to enter into  a detailed experimental matrix; that is, an
              expert system  can be developed that provides the alloy chemistry and 
              processing parameters that will yield a material with the  desired properties
              on the first experiment.  Currently, such  a system does not exist.  ***
