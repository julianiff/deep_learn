Abstract    :
              ***  9622403  Ehsani  Fiber Reinforced Composites, FRP, are fast becoming a
              viable  new construction material.  Perhaps the most suitable area of 
              application for these materials is in the field of  strengthening, repair and
              rehabilitation of existing civil  structures.  A major concern, however, is the
              quality control  at the time of construction and the long-term behavior of 
              these materials.  The primary focus of this study is to develop a Non- 
              Destructive Evaluation system for determining the  characteristics of
              composites used in the construction  industry.  The equipment can be utilized
              after the completion  of the construction to monitor any deterioration or 
              delamination of the FRP which could result from environmental  effects such as
              ultraviolet rays, moisture penetration, etc.  The quality of rehabilitation
              will be monitored  nondestructively by ultrasonic inspection of internal 
              defects, voids and delaminations.  In this research "kissing" and "slip" bonded
              interfaces,  often dangerous for the integrity of material systems, will  be
              investigated by exciting strong interface waves.  It is  expected that one will
              be able to successfully detect these  defects by generating interface waves at
              the imperfect bond  interfaces using an ultrasonic scanner. ***
