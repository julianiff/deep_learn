Abstract    :
              9622612  Fussell    This project will integrate three types of machining models:
              geometric models for determining chip loads, mechanistic models for predicting
              forces and deflections from chip loads, and inverse mechanistic models to find
              the feedrate needed for a specified force or surface finish.   The technical
              approach will use a variable mesh  Z-buffer to determine chip loads, both
              volumetric centroid and discrete volumetric centroid mechanistic models to
              predict milling forces and cutter deflection, and will develop numerical
              techniques that determine a feedrate to maintain a specified deflection and
              surface finish limits.   These are the modeling elements needed to
              automatically select feedrates when machining contoured surfaces.  Using these
              predicated feedrates, experiments will be conducted at Turbocam, a firm that
              will provide time on a five-axis machining center.      Results of  this
              research, which include modeling, computation and experiment, will be a
              feedrate optimization method that is computationally efficient, so as to be
              transferable to industry, allowing improved productivity and workpiece quality
              in complex multi-axis Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining.
