Abstract    :
              9622220  Rahn   This research equipment grant supports the purchase of a
              mechatronics workstation: a high performance computer work station for data
              acquisition and control, with many of the sensors, actuators and drivers needed
              for electro-mechanical interfacing of experimental manufacturing equipment. 
              The team of  researchers will use this system for several new and ongoing
              projects like: control of flexible gantry cranes, partial state feedback for
              rigid link electrically driven manipulators,  intelligent scanners for
              selective laser sintering, Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) based control
              for rapid prototyping, and improved ride-through for motor drives, and power
              systems diagnostics.     A major strength of this project is the investigators'
              multidisciplinary cooperation that will be enhanced by this award. The impact
              of this equipment grant will be enhancement of the experimental research
              component of the proposed research projects, and it will support the broader
              control and dynamics educational infrastructure at Clemson University.
