Abstract    :
              9622287   Beaman    The traditional Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) solid
              freeform fabrication technology is based on only one powder in the sintering
              process.  This award funds a collaborative industry/university research project
              to develop a multi-material SLS which can fabricate parts composed of multiple
              materials.  The research project consists of  (1) design and development of a
              multi-material selective laser sintering machine capable of fabricating
              components containing material gradients; and (2) fabrication and testing of
              high stiffness-to-density ration components possessing shape optimization and
              metal-ceramic components possessing blended interfaces.  The ultimate goal is
              to develop a prototype machine for further understanding of the physical
              principles of powder delivery for multi-materials based SLS.   The technique
              has the potential to allow the creation of many unique components containing
              improved stiffness-to-density ratios or the creation of complex metal-ceramic
              components.  The benefits of this technology include greatly reduced
              fabrication time and cost, and the capability to achieve in making
              multi-materials component in one operation.  The project will be in partnership
              with industry to identify quantifiable requirements for implementation.
