Abstract    :
              9622143  Meier  An engineering research equipment grant will support the 
              acquisition of a general purpose up-to-date precision ion  milling polishing
              system for preparation of electron  transparent specimens for TEM and AP-FIM
              observations.  The  equipment will be used in a number of research projects 
              related to high resolution studies of the microstructure of  layered coatings,
              environmental degradation,  superconductivity, etc.  ***
