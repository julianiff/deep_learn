Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9622183    The aim of the research project is to obtain an
              understanding of the heat transfer processes involved in high-heat-flux spray
              cooling, including conduction, convection, and phase change in the forms of
              evaporation and boiling.  Experimental investigation is the primary research
              technique.  Recent studies have shown that the heat transfer process in spray
              cooling is highly dependent on the spray characeristics and the surface
              conditions.  In order to obtain a successful model/correlation for he process,
              it is essential to have  a data matrix with variations in:  spray
              characteristics, fluid properties, surface conditions, and spray/surface
              orientation with respect to gravity.  The ability to measure the spray
              parameters is essential for a better understanding of the spray cooling
              process.  The research equipment requested is a Phase-Doppler/Anemometer (PDA)
              which is capable of measuring simultaneously the droplets diameters,
              velocities, and the number flux of a liquid spray in a non-intrusive manner. 
              The PDA measures these parameters using the light scattered by the droplets
              moving through a very small probe defined by two intersecting laser spray by
              characteristics.    There is no comparable equipment available at the
              University of Central Florida.  This research equipment will also be used by
              several other faculty members in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
              department who are conducting research in combustion and single-phase/two-phase
              fluid flow and heat transfer.  ***
