Abstract    :
              9622212  Colucci  This project is a symposium to facilitate the implementation
              of  innovative research products and techniques for the repair and 
              rehabilitation of bridges and pavements by State highway agencies  affiliated
              with the Northeast Association of State Transportation  Officials (NASTO).  The
              one-and-a-half-day symposium, to be held  in Providence, Rhode Island, in
              Spring 1996, will feature a day  of presentations by invited researchers,
              followed by a half-day  of interactive discussions with an audience of
              approximately 28  NASTO-affiliated engineers representing the 11 northeastern 
              states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.    The objective
              of the symposium is to inform bridge and pavement  engineers from
              NASTO-affiliated highway agencies of successful  new techniques and materials
              which laboratory and field tests  have shown can offer highway agencies
              solutions to bridge and  pavement repair and rehabilitation that are more
              superior in  performance and cost-efficiency to standard practices.  After a 
              day of presentations on successful new techniques and materials,  the
              researchers will engage the audience of practicing engineers  in a  dialogue to
              (1) clarity their understanding of the new  research products, (2) address
              their concerns about the  feasibility of these products, (3) discuss barriers
              to  implementation of these new products, (4) identify strategies to  overcome
              obstacles and implement the new techniques and materials  in pilot projects,
              (5) determine future research needs.    A proceeding of the symposium will be
              published in the summer of  1996, and in 1997 NASTO will issue a follow-up
              report on the  implementation efforts undertaken by the engineers in their 
              respective highway agencies.  ***
