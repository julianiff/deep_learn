Abstract    :
              9622609  Newkome  The overriding theme of this research concerns the 
              investigation of the preparation, structural aspects, and  chemical properties
              of dendrimers (cascade macromolecules)  that have been internally modified. 
              Pursuant to this goal  is the design and synthesis of application-oriented 
              dendritic building blocks possessing masked, or inert,  transformable
              functionality to be accessed for use after  dendrimer construction.  Project
              goals include:  1)  Construction of functionally differentiated dendritic 
              building blocks for the site-specific incorporation of  application-oriented
              functionality into dendrimers.  2)  Construction of dendrimers with
              compartmentalized moieties  capable of forming connections with other
              dendrimers.  3)  Concommitant (`combinatorial") construction of multiple, 
              dendritic assemblies (dendritic libraries).  4)  Unimolecular micellar
              constrained and templated preparation  of monodisperse, small particle,
              semiconductor crystallites  (also described as "quantum dots").  5) Precise
              arrangement  of semiconductor crystallites into three-dimensional  superarrays
              allowing Q-particle electronic coupling "fine  tuning".  %%%  The merits of
              this research rely on the study of the  chemistry associated with
              physicochemical properties of  highly branched, specifically designed,
              macromolecules, and  the attendant utility inherent in those properties. 
              Results  of this research will expand foundations for understanding  of
              chemical phenomena occurring within "designer" reaction  environments.  ***
