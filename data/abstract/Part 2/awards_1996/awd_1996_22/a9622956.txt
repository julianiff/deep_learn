Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    This proposal is to fund a workshop on non-tubular heat exchangers. 
              These devices have been gaining popularity in Europe, but their penetration in
              American markets has been limited.  The workshop will explore potential
              applications, advantages/disadvantages, and future research needs.
