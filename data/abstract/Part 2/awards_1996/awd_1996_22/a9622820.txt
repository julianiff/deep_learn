Abstract    :
              Abstract  ATM-9622820  Tucker, Donna F.  University of Kansas  Title: Summer
              Plateau Circulation Systems of Western North                 America    This
              award will allow the investigation of the summer plateau  circulation system of
              western North America for two time periods,  one in the most recent ten years
              and one in the most recent thirty  years.  Different types of special data,
              available from military  and other mesonets over this region, will be utilized
              for this  purpose.  An attempt will be made to examine the interannual 
              variability of these circulation systems.  This type of data  analysis is
              important for understanding the plateau climate and for  the validation of
              climate models over such problematic high  elevation regions.
