              Aspen Winter Astrophysics Conference              The 1996 Aspen Winter
              Astrophysics Conference will be held  during 21-28 January, 1996, on the topic
              "Black Hole X-Ray  Transients". The rapidly expanding radio, optical, X-ray,
              and  gamma ray data base on these objects will be presented, along  with
              discussion of the theory of the outburst, the underlying  stellar evolution,
              and the mechanism of the superluminal radio  jets. This provides a balanced
              combination of theoretical and  experimental results. Approximately 75
              participants are expected.  Additional funding is requested from NASA and DOE.
