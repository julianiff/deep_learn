Abstract    :
              9625830  Wang    The proposer plans to conduct his research in the following
              topics: (i)  Convolution models for phase transitions; (ii) Concentration
              phenomena of  solutions of semilinear elliptic equations; (iii) Qualitative
              behavior of  solutions to chemotaxis systems. In the first front, effort will
              be made  to understand the propagation of interfaces, the shape of energy
              minimizers  and the dynamics of typical solutions. In the second front, of main
              concern  are the existence and locations of concentration of solutions as a
              physical  parameter becomes small. In the third front, the effects of various
              biological  and physical parameters on the solutions of the systems will be
              studied.  %%%    The convolution models arise in the mathematical studies of
              grain boundaries   in crystalline solids, binary alloys as well as in the study
              of  excitation in neural networks. The equations in the second front are 
              nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations of mathematical physics and one arising in  
              the study of chemotaxis of cells. The chemotaxis  systems considered in the
              third front model the oriented motion of cells in  response to the
              concentration gradient of chemicals in the environment,   and the research done
              and proposed here aims at understanding how   the motility and the sensitivity
              of cells to the chemical affect    the size of the population of cells as well
              as the way in which  cells are   distributed in the long run.  The proposed
              research in all  the three parts will help reveal and understand the important
              phenomena  such as phase seperations, concentration and blow-up in the related 
              fields of material sciences, biophysics and quantum mechanics.  ***
