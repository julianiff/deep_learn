Abstract    :
              Gessel    This award supports the investigations of Gessel on problems in
              several areas of enumerative combinatorics. All involve applications of the
              method of generating functions, either to solve counting problems or to study
              sequence of rational numbers. The topics to be studied are binary trees,
              noncommutative symmetric functions, rook theory, rational functions with
              nonnegative power series coefficients, and generalized Dedekind sums.    This
              research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of
              Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections
              of objects can be arranged.   The behavior of discrete systems is extremely
              important to modern communications. For example, the design of large networks,
              such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in
              computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of
              combinatorial research.
