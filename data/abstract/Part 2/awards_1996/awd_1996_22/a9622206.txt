Abstract    :
                This two-year award supports participation of graduate students and a
              postdoctoral researcher in a U.S.-U.K. cooperative research project between
              Andrew Barron of Rice University and W. H. Rankin of the University of
              Edinburgh.  The objective of their research is to determine the structure of a
              series of Group 13 compounds - aluminum, gallium, and indium - through analysis
              of electron diffraction data.  They will study the compounds under conditions
              similar to those employed in metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) of
              thin films. The investigators will write mathematical models to describe the
              molecular geometries and interpret the data.    The U.S. investigator brings to
              this collaboration expertise in molecular control studies of inorganic
              materials.  This is complemented by the U.K. investigator's expertise in the
              structure of small molecules.  The project will advance our understanding of
              molecular control of the structure, morphology and purity of thin films.
