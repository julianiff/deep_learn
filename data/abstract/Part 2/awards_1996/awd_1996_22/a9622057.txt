Abstract    :
              The PIs will perform a three-year study of nonlinear wave evolution,
              concentrating on modeling the  magnetic field vector's random wandering path. 
              Using 2 1/2 dimensional simulations, the investigators will explain the more
              prevalent spherical behavior of Alfvenic fluctuations.  Moreover, complement
              their hybrid 1 1/2 dimensional simulations, they will employ a pure fluid MHD
              simulation of a radially expanding solar wind to examine the cumulative
              evolution of Alfven waves from small amplitudes near the Sun to large
              amplitudes further from the Sun, where nonlinear processes become
              significant.***
