Abstract    :
              Sigman  9622657   Research centers on the generalization of the duality theory
              between one dimensional insurance risk models and one-dimensional stochastic
              content models to multidimensional  queueing network, inventory network,
              multi-population, and multiple income source models, leading to upper and lower
              bounds for computing important probabilities of interest.  Stochastic content 
              models such as inventory, fluid, storage, reservoir and queueing models are
              already known to share an elegant duality with insurance risk models in the
              special case when the state space of the models can be characterized by
              non-negative real numbers.  To handle network, multi-population and
              multi-source models, it is necessary to expand this duality to the
              multi-dimensional state-space cases.   It is expected that such a duality would
              contribute to the creation of a general theory for multi-dimensional risk
              processes (which currently does not exist) and applications of this theory to
              insurance, business, population, inventory, queueing, etc., would be extremely
              useful.
