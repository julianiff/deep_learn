Abstract    :
              Twomey  9622132   This research planning grant centers on investigation into the
              analysis and maximization of large complex industrial systems through Advanced
              Distributed Simulation (ADS).  ADS technology provides an interactive,
              time-consistent synthetic environment for geographically distributed
              simulations.  It is a combination of live, virtual and constructive simulation.
               This research focuses on ADS as a tool for the analysis and maximization of
              large complex manufacturing systems.  ADS provides the capability for
              enterprise-wide modeling (within the enterprise: design and manufacturing
              processes; and outside the enterprise: vendors and small supporting
              manufacturers) through a fully integrated system of individual simulations,
              where the ultimate goal is the maximization of the entire system.   The outcome
              of the proposed research will (1) highlight the advantages and potential
              benefits of fully integrated systems for the analysis and maximization of an
              entire industrial system, and (2) contribute to the advancement of simulation
              aggregation specifically addressing issues related to ADS.  A planning grant is
              necessary so that: (1) a complete understanding of ADS may be gained, (2)
              opportunities for an ADS application to a targeted local manufacturer may be
              investigated, (3) a simple but representative prototype may be developed with
              at least one neural network aggregation model, and (4) a full-scale NSF
              proposal can be written.
