Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9622471    Principal Investigator:  Yasuo Kuga/University
              of Washington    Title:  Research Equipment Grant: Instrumentation for
              Space-time Interferometry and Imaging in Composite Materials and Random Media  
               Abstract    This is a Research Equipment Grant for purchase of optical and 
              microwave equipment which will be used for development of experimental
              techniques and systems for generalized space-time interferometry. This includes
              the time-frequency correlation for pulse, spatial interference for angular and
              polarization correlations, and coherent interference for backscattering.  The
              PI's present systems are inadequate for present and future needs because of
              limited signal to noise ratio, unavailability of key components, and lack of
              modulation capability in the optical systems. The requested equipment,  a
              general purpose wideband microwave amplifier, microwave components and an
              optical EO amplitude modulator, will remove these restraints and will great
              enhance the PI's NSF sponsored research effort in remote sensing.  Especially
              the optical EO modulator is essential for converting the present system for
              space-time interferometry.  Several projects will utilize the enhanced
              experimental capability: (i) ultrawideband scattering by random media (ii)
              angular polarization correlations and imaging of objects in random media (iii)
              enhanced backscattering and resonant location and (iv) characterization of
              composite materials.  The equipment will also be used by several
              multidisciplinary research groups in collaboration with the Electromagnetic and
              Remote Sensing Laboratory, which has 6 faculty members and more than 20
              graduate students.
