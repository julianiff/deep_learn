Abstract    :
                    Joint Oceanographic Institutions Incorporated (JOI) proposes to provide
              the U.S. oceanographic community the opportunity to participate in the future
              planning of the Nansen Arctic Drilling Program.  The Nansen Arctic Drilling
              Program (NAD) is a potentially significant international research effort
              designed to understand the geological and oceanographic evolution of the
              Arctic, as well as elucidate the contribution of the Arctic region to global
              change and its forcing functions.  This knowledge will help characterize the
              Arctic basin and its impact on global processes.    NAD is planning  a workshop
              to produce a ten-year "Implementation Plan" for scientific ocean drilling in
              the Arctic.  The NAD Implementation Plan will outline the strategy and steps
              necessary to achieve NAD's scientific goals.  Because of the difficult and
              costly nature of scientific ocean drilling in the Arctic, the endeavor will
              require close multinational cooperation and funding.  The workshop's planning
              and organization will be guided by the NAD Secretariat, which is funded by the
              eight NAD member countries and housed at JOI.    Specifically, this proposal
              seeks full support for the travel of U.S. scientists, and two JOI staff to
              attend the workshop as well as partial funding to cover the cost to JOI/ the
              NAD Secretariat to organize the workshop, as well as to produce and print the
              resulting NAD Implementation Plan.  The travel expenses of the participating
              non-U.S. scientists (about 30) will be covered by individual NAD member and
              observer countries.  Funding for the rest of the cost of the workshop itself
              will be sought from participating countries and the balance will be covered by
              the NAD Secretariat.
