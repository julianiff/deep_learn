Abstract    :
              9622195  Thompson         The University of Texas will operate the Research
              Vessel  LONGHORN during 1996 as a general oceanographic vessel in support  of
              NSF-sponsored research projects.  The R/V LONGHORN is a 103'  research vessel
              constructed in 1971 and stretched to its present  length in 1986.  The vessel
              is owned and operated by the University  of Texas and has a 1996 operating
              schedule of 91 days of which 66  are in support of NSF-sponsored programs.  The
              remaining 25 days  support State of Texas programs.  The ship will operate
              primarily  in the Gulf of Mexico.         The LONGHORN is part of a fleet of
              ships used by the National  Science Foundation to support marine research. 
              Most oceanographic  research requires highly specialized equipment and
              extensive  support from the ship's crew.  An increasing number of research 
              projects require equipment that must be permanently installed on a  ship and
              for which the ship must be specifically designed.  Such  equipment also
              requires highly trained crew members for maintenance  and operation.  These
              vessels do not operate in the same manner as  general cargo or fishing vessels.
               NSF supports the operation of a  variety of ships specifically dedicated to
              oceanographic research.   These vessels are operated by universities and
              institutions around  the country.
