Abstract    :
                  Abstract   Berenstein  9622249    Berenstein will investigate several
              problems in complex analysis   and integral geometry which have applications to
              subjects like   computational algebra and medical imaging.  The original link
              between   these problems lies in the use of methods from complex analysis,  
              especially multidimensional residues. Specific questions on the first   subject
              include effective bounds for the Nullstellensatz over fields of   positive
              characteristic. On the second, the use of wavelets and   hyperbolic geometry to
              study, respectively, localized versions of the   Euclidean Radon transform and
              the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map for the   Laplace operator in the Euclidean plane.
                 The project involves an interplay between Pure Mathematics (complex   and
              harmonic analysis) and applications to several imaging and detection  
              problems. Most notable is the localization of the Radon transform using  
              wavelets. We expect that this algorithm will help to significantly decrease  
              the radiation dosage received by patients during CAT scans, as well as   reduce
              processing time. The last consideration would be especially   important if it
              could be applied to MRI scans and we plan to consider how   to adapt our method
              to this widely used medical imaging procedure also   (eventually helping reduce
              its cost). Another question we study is   motivated by a different imaging
              method, Electrical Impedance Tomography.   This low resolution but very low
              cost procedure has applications to   Medicine as well as Material Sciences
              (detection of cracks). Finally, the   problems of Commutative Algebra mentioned
              in the proposal also arise from   engineering applications, for instance, robot
              motion planning    and control of distributed parameter systems.
