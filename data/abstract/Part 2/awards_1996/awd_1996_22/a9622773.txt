Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a project concerned with the  theory and 
              application of the Hardy-Littlewood circle method.  The investigator is
              pursuing an improved, detailed understanding  of the circle method both from
              the analytic viewpoint, through  estimates for mean values of  exponential
              sums, and from an  arithmetic viewpoint, through an understanding of the role
              played  by the trivial solutions of diophantine systems lying on special 
              subvarieties. The analytic viewpoint will be considered in  through further
              investigation and development of the proposer's  new method for estimating
              fractional moments of smooth Weyl sums  and through detailed investigations of
              low moments of exponential  sums. The arithmetic viewpoint will be considered
              by continuing  the investigator's research on the number of non-diagonal 
              solutions of systems of symmetric diagonal  equations using  slicing methods
              and also perhaps by sieve methods. The latter  viewpoint will also be pursued
              through the testing of the "Quasi-  Hardy-Littlewood" model suggested recently
              by Vaughan and Wooley.    This research falls into the general mathematical
              field of  Number Theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the  study
              of the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those  dealing with the
              divisibility of one  whole number by another. It  is among the oldest branches
              of mathematics and  was pursued for  many centuries for purely aesthetic
              reasons. However, within  the  last half century it has become an indispensable
              tool in diverse   applications in areas such as data transmission and
              processing,  and  communication systems.
