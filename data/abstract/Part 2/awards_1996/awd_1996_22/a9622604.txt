Abstract    :
                  Proposal No. OPP-9622604    Principal Investigator: Coakley, B.     
              ABSTRACT     This proposal seeks support for a design study of a
              submarine-mounted SWAth Bathymetric Imaging System (SWABS) to be used on US
              Navy nuclear-powered submarines during future unclassified science cruises to
              the Arctic Ocean.  The system would be an adaptation of a demonstrated design,
              the SeaMARCTM towed side-looking sonar system.  Towed platforms can be readily
              adapted for hull mounting on a submarine.     The proposed 12kHz side-looking
              sonar will acquire co-registered bathymetry and backscatter of the seafloor
              across a swath up to 20km wide.  If the SWABS is installed for the 1997 cruise,
              the remaining three cruises in the Submarine Science program (SUBSCI) could
              collect more than 800,000 km2 of data, covering a large fraction of the deep
              Arctic Basin operational area for these cruises.     The final result of this
              study will be a set of documents that demonstrate the feasibility of installing
              a swath bathymetric imaging system on the submarine assigned to the 1997 SUBSCI
              cruise.
