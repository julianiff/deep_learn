Abstract    :
              9622782  LANDRY      This award supports a Research Experience for Undergraduate
              (REU)   Site Proposal. This educational program is the only one of its   kind
              in he Pacific Basin, and is one of the few nationwide giving   undergraduate
              students the opportunity to participate directly in   oceanographic programs
              involving the open sea. This program   exposes students from both the
              continental United States and the   Pacific Islands to a broad diversity of
              scientific opportunities   and research problems in the ocean sciences.
