Abstract    :
              9622068  He    This project lies in the interface of complex analysis, topology
              and geometry. It  deals with conformal geometry and circle domains in the
              plane. Conformal mappings of relative circle domains generalize mappings
              induced from circle packings of the same combinatorial pattern. The
              investigator will try to determine whether classical results for circle packing
              maps hold for these generalized mappings as well. In addition, the investigator
              will study the following problem in topological fluid mechanics: estimate the
              lower bound for the energy of incompressible vector fields which are subject to
              deformations under some ideal physical condition.    The circle packing and
              circle mapping problems are classical problems touching on several different
              branches of mathematics. For example, recently it was discovered that
              three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry involving negative curvature plays an
              important role in circle pattern and packing problems. Also, certain extremal
              packing problems and their higher dimensional analogs - whose solutions can be
              approximated with computer simulation - may have applications in industrial
              packing problems.
