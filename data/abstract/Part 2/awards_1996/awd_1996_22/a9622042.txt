Abstract    :
              Abstract  Cappelli  CTS-9622042    The PI proposes to purchase a molecular beam
              mass spectrometer (MBMS) system for-near surface radical species detection
              during chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth taking place in a variety of
              systems currently being investigated.  These systems include films of diamond,
              diamond-like carbon (DLC), cubic boron nitride and carbon nitride.  The
              addition of this instrumentation to the PI's laboratory would allow him to
              perform a compositional and energy analysis of the impinging plasma (including
              ions and radicals) in order to help develop a detailed mechanistic
              understanding of the deposition process including the effects of ion
              interactions with the growth surface, and the validation of gas phase radical
              transport models.
