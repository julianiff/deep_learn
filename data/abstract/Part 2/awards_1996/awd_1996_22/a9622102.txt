Abstract    :
                Abstract   DMS-9622102  Wang    This proposal is concerned with problems of
              the existence, qualitative properties, and multiplicity of solutions as well as
              bifurcation branches of solutions for some model  equations of nonlinear
              elliptic problems including a nonlinear Neumann problem and a semilinear
              Schrodinger equation. Using these model equations we shall develop some general
              and systematic methods and approaches which can be used for more general
              problems. The proposal will use variational and topological techniques to
              develop analytical results for the problems concerned.      Partial
              differential equations form a basis for mathematical modeling of the physical
              world. The problems in the proposal arise from a variety of areas of applied
              sciences. The role of mathematical analysis is to provide qualitative and
              quantitative information about the solutions, answering questions about
              uniqueness, multiplicity, shape and growth.
