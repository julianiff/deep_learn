Abstract    :
              Aldous    A general methodology for the study of size-asymptotics of random
              finite structures is to seek to establish, via the techniques of weak
              convergence theory, existence of a limiting continuous-space structure. In this
              spirit, one part of the proposal is to develop a new approach to the emergence
              of the giant component in random graph theory, by representing limit component
              sizes as excursion lengths in a Brownian-type process. This representation
              opens up a relation between two well-studied but hitherto apparently unrelated
              areas of probability theory. Other parts of the proposal include foundational
              work relating to mixing times for Markov chains, and analysis of specific
              randomized algorithms.    As background, the study of matter aggregating into
              clusters is of interest in many areas of science: polymers in physical
              chemistry, condensation of raindrops in clouds, and formation of galaxies in
              the early universe, to name just three examples.  Models of clustering
              incorporating the effects of randomness received some attention from physicists
              in the early and mid 1980s, but faded out when the mathematical tools then
              available had been used to their limits.  The main part of this proposal 
              concerns detailed study of one particular model of this kind via sophisticated
              modern mathematical tools.  It is hoped that  new tools to be developed under
              this proposal will be useful in at least some of these scientific areas.
