Abstract    :
                Abstract:  Pan      Pan's investigation will be focused on various singular
              integral and oscillatory integral operators which arise naturally in many
              problems in harmonic analysis and related fields including complex analysis and
              the theory of partial differential equations. With applications to a large
              number of problems in mathematics, these integrals have received an increasing
              amount of recognition for their importance. While research in this area has
              been intensive and fruitful, much more remains to be understood. This project
              will cover many topics of current interest, which when finished will make a big
              stride toward the full understanding of these operators and related problems in
              mathematical analysis.    The objects under investigation form an important
              part of the mathematical modeling of physical phenomena such as heat conducting
              and wave motion. They also appear in engineering problems involving electric
              circuits and signal processing. Thus, gaining understanding of such objects
              will not only have theoretical values but also  provide guidance in other areas
              of science and engineering.
