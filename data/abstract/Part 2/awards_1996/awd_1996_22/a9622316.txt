Abstract    :
              The specific causes of population declines of migratory birds are poorly
              understood.  A major hypothesis to explain the declines is human-caused habitat
              conversion and loss in the tropical wintering grounds of the migratory birds. 
              The objective of this research is to assess the ecological health of migrant
              land birds in human-modified versus natural habitats in Jamaica, West Indies. 
              This island includes mangroves and Caribbean tropical dry forest, and
              human-modified habitats of citrus and coffee orchards, grazed second-growth
              scrub, and the  ecologically complex rural residential areas.  Within each
              habitat the investigators will quantify (1) abundance of resident and migratory
              birds, (2) overwinter survival of selected migratory species, (3) indicators of
              bird condition for the selected species, and (4) seasonal patterns of food
              resource availability capable of supporting the observed bird populations. 
              These data coupled with experimental manipulations of resource abundance will
              allow the investigators to test alternative hypotheses explaining the
              ecological bases for the individual and population responses to these different
              habitats.            The results of this research will be immediately
              applicable to conservation of animal populations by indicating which human
              activities are most compatible with maintenance of biotic resources in tropical
              Caribbean countries.  The effects of habitat-specific land-use on avian
              consumers and their food resources is critically needed for the development of
              ecologically sound and effective wildlife-conservation recommendations.
