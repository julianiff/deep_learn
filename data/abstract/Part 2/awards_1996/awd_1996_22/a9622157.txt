Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9622157  GIBLIN, ANNE  MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY   
              Investigators from the Marine Biological Laboratory and the University of
              Michigan propose to apply a new, computationally simple, modeling scheme to the
               problem of understanding the hydrological controls on terrestrial arctic
              ecosystems.  The model will allow researchers to calculate the flux of
              nutrients, gases, and water through lakes, streams, and entire watersheds so
              that the ecological response of the terrestrial vegetation may be examined. The
              development of a model to determine the flux of materials and water flow is
              urgently needed because the cost of observing and calculating the flow
              throughout the Arctic is prohibitive. The new model will be used in conjunction
              with global climate models to test the effects of changing climate scenarios on
              the response of vegetation in the Arctic.  The Arctic is expected to feel the
              impact of global change to a greater degree than other places on Earth and the
              new modeling scheme will allow predictions of the ecosystem response on the
              landscape scale without the necessity to run complex models requiring
              prohibitively long computational times.
