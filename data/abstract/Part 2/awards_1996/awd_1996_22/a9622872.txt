Abstract    :
              Abstract  Chen    Chen will investigate problems in two areas: chaotic behavior
              of the Lorenz system and the interfacial phenomena in material science.  For
              the first area Chen seeks to obtain a complete bifurcation diagram of the
              chaotic behaviors of the system for all the parameter values and to show the
              existence of a conjectured Lorenz attractor.  The main tools to be used will be
              shooting arguments, homotopy theory, bifurcation theory, and chaos theory on
              maps.  For the second area the goal is to study certain free boundary problems
              which describe geometric motions of hypersurfaces, to analyze the asymptotic
              behavior of certain evolution equations, and to connect the solutions of free
              boundary problems with the asymptotic behaviors of the evolution equations.   
              The Lorenz system was one of the very first examples that stimulated the
              formation and development of the theory of chaos and later on became a typical
              example in many text books of dynamical systems and/or chaos theory. 
              Nevertheless, except for numerous numerical experiments, there are few rigorous
              analyses for this system.  The object of this project is to provide such a
              rigorous foundation.  The related study of interfacial dynamics is of
              particular importance in material science.
