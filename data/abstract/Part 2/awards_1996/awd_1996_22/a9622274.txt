Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Chen  9622274      Support was requested for a scanning probe
              microscope capable of operating as a scanning tunneling microscope, an atomic
              force microscope, or a scanning thermal microscope.  Applications to the study
              of energy transfer in nanostructures, electronic devices, and optoelectronic
              devices are envisioned.  The grant was supported under the Research Equipement
              Grant Program.
