Abstract    :
              The proposed research investigates the impact of plant chemical inputs on soil
              microbial processes in the Alaskan taiga forest.  Studies will focus on tannins
              produced by alder and balsam poplar, two species that form part of the
              successional sequence in the floodplain forests of Alaska.  Tannins of varying
              chemical structure will be isolated from these species and added to soils from
              both alder and poplar sites. Their effects on a suite of microbial processes
              including respiration, nitrogen mineralization, and enzyme activities will be
              measured.  The specific structure of the chemicals will be linked with their
              biological activities to improve our understanding of the ecological function
              of these chemicals.  Tannins will be applied from each species to each soil to
              determine whether the microbial communities can adapt to the chemicals coming
              in.    These studies will greatly improve our understanding of how plants
              affect the soil processes that control nutrient availability and therefore
              plant succession in the Alaskan taiga.  We will improve our understanding of
              forest community dynamics, controls on litter quality and decomposition,
              plant-microbe interactions, and the role of microbial community composition in
              ecosystem function.
