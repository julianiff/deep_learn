Abstract    :
              DMS Proposal #9622841  PI:  Dr. Maria Girardi   University of South Carolina @
              Columbia    Girardi's  ultimate goal is to gain a better   understanding of
              Functional Analysis; her approach   is to examine the interplay between its
              various   sub-areas; at this time, her main thrust is in the   branch of Banach
              Space Theory.  She will continue   her work, in which she has made progress
              over the   past years, on several  (related)   long-standing problems in Banach
              space theory that   are centered around the Radon-Nikodym Property.    She will
              also continue examining the Bochner-Lebesgue   space and begin a new project
              that ties together   Functional Analysis and Homological Algebra.     Roughly
              speaking, a Banach space is a collection   of points that has, among other
              things, a way to   measure the "distance" between any two points.    An example
              is the 3-D Euclidean (ordinary) space.   Another example is the space of
              "suitably nice"   functions (so a point in this type of Banach space   is a
              function) with distance suitably clarified.    A practical application of
              Banach space theory is   compact disc coding; a sound signal is, roughly  
              speaking, a function in a suitable Banach space.   Unfortunately the sound
              signal contains too much   information to store on  the CD so the signal is  
              approximated by an element from the Banach space   that is close to  the true
              element (this is where   the notion of distance enters).  Understanding the  
              structure of Banach spaces aids in the above, and   other, practical
              applications.
