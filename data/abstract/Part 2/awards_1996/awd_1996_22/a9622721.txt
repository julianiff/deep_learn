               AST-9622721    These funds will be used to build the Multiple Mirror 
              Telescope (MMT) Advanced Echelle Spectrograph, know an  MAESTRO.The MMT is a
              6.5 meter aperture telescope.  On its  completion it will be the third largest
              telescope in the  world.  MAESTRO incorporates a number of in novations which 
              result in high throughput and large wavelength.  It will  cover the visible and
              nearby infrared and ultraviolet  regions of the spectrum (3056 Angstroms to
              1,100 Angstroms)  in a single exposure with a resolution of 100,000.  The 
              focal plane will be made up of an array of six 2048 X 4096  element CCD's.  The
              grating will consist of two 52 l/mm  replica units each of which is 40 cm long.
               The beam will be  cross-dispersed with two large fused-silica prisms.
