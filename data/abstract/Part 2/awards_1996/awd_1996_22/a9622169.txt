              Hansma    This  project  will advance the state-of-the-art in Atomic  Force 
              Microscopy,  AFM, for materials research. Specifically,  work  is  proposed to
              design and fabricate new cantilevers down to the size  range of 2 microns wide
              and 4 microns long together with the  new  AFMs  that  will  be required to use
              them. These new  cantilevers  will  make it possible to achieve resonant
              frequencies of over  a  mega-Hertz  for cantilevers gentle enough to use on a
              wide  range  of  materials  including soft biomaterials.   This  will  require 
              spring  constants  of order 0.1 N/m, which can be  achieved  with  metallic 
              cantilevers of order 50 nm thick. These new cantilevers  and  AFMs  will  be 
              used for imaging the  motion  of  individual  protein  molecules  during the
              process  of  biochemical  reaction  leading biomaterial products such as RNA. 
              %%%  This  project  will advance the state-of-the-art in Atomic  Force 
              Microscopy, AFM. Specifically, work is proposed to build the next  generation 
              of  AFMs  and  to demonstrate  their  advantages  for  materials  research. The
              United States currently leads the  world  in  the production of commercial
              AFMs. This success is based,  in  part, on previous NSF support, which lead to
              prototypes that  are  the basis of that current generation of AFMs. The next
              generation  of  AFMs  will  use cantilevers that are less than one-tenth  the 
              size used currently. This grant will fund work on the development  of both
              these cantilevers and the new AFMs to use them. These new  AFMs  will  be 
              faster, gentler and have higher  resolution  than  current AFMs.  ***
