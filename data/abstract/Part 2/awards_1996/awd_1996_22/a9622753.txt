Abstract    :
              Gonek  9622753    Professor Gonek will study various problems concerning the
              distribution of zeros and the mean values of the Riemann zeta function. He
              hopes to show that certain analogues of the zeta function defined by Dirichlet
              series have a positive proportion of zeros off the critical strip. He also
              intends to study various moment problems for the zeta function. He will also
              study additive divisor problems and theorems of Barban-Davenport-Halberstam
              type.    This project falls into the general area of number theory. Number
              theory is one of the oldest areas of mathematics and yet every generation
              returns to these problems again. Encryption and error correcting codes have
              been vastly improved as a direct consequence of recent research in number
              theory.  ??
