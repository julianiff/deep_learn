Abstract    :
              9622660  Chu    The Texas Center for Superconductivity at the University  of 
              Houston  (TCSUH)  has organized a Workshop on  the  Physics,  Materials    and 
                Applications   of    High    Temperature  Superconductivity (HTS).  The
              Workshop celebrating the  10th  anniversary of the discovery of HTS will be
              held on March 12  through 16, 1996, in Houston, Texas.  The present status  of 
              HTS  will be reviewed, and the future of the field  will  be  contemplated  so
              that the HTS science can be  unraveled  and  the  technology developed. 
              Leading scientists in the  field  will give plenary and review talks.  Invited
              and contributed  talks  on new and major findings and poster session  provide 
              excellent  training  opportunity for graduate  students  and  postdocs.    % %
