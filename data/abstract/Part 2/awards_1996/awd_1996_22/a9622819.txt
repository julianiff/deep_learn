Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for the investigator's continued  research into the
              Rankin-Selberg method. Much of this work will  likely be joint work. The
              research will likely shift from the  search for new Rankin-Selberg integrals to
              extracting more  information from existing Rankin-Selberg constructions. An 
              initial problem will be the nonvanishing of the archimedean local  integrals
              for the symmetric cube L-functions on GL(2). Friedberg,  Hoffstein, and Bump
              have been exploring reflection groups coming  from double  Dirichlet series
              with automorphic L-functions on  GL(n) and quadratic characters. The
              corresponding question for  GL(2) and cubic characters will be studied. Other
              problems on  automorphic forms will be investigated.     This research falls 
              into the general mathematical field of Number Theory.  Number  theory has its
              historical roots in the study of the whole  numbers,  addressing such questions
              as those dealing with the  divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is
              among the  oldest branches of mathematics and  was pursued for many  centuries
              for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last  half century it has
              become an indispensable tool in diverse   applications in areas such as data
              transmission and processing,  and  communication systems.
