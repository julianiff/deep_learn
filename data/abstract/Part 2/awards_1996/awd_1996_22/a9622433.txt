Abstract    :
              9622433  Zabinsky   This award supports research on the design of composite
              structures.  The research will address the problem of optimizing the structural
              design of a composite panel to minimize cost while including manufacturing
              considerations.  Specifically, the research will integrate finite-element
              methods with new state-of-the-art global optimization algorithms.   If
              successful, this research will lead to a design tool for anisotropic composites
              that will enable designers to optimize structures encountered in many
              industries.  The research may have significant impact on the aerospace industry
              (e.g., design of a composite wing or fuselage), the naval industry (e.g.,
              design of composite deckhouses or bulkheads) and/or the automobile industry
              (e.g., design of composite engine hoods or body panels).  Providing engineers
              with the capability to optimally design cost-effective composite structures
              will increase the competitiveness of US-based industries.
