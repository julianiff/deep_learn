Abstract    :
              DMS9622307  Troy  The primary goal of this research is to obtain an
              understanding of   the mechanisms responsible for pattern formation in bistable
              systems  which are near a second order phase transition point.  An example of
              such  a system is a magnetic material which undergoes a phase transition from 
              ferromagnetic to helicoidal as a physically important parameter (e.g. 
              pressure, or the composition of metal alloys) passes through a critical  value.
               Such phase transitions also occur in liquid crystals, and in  concentrated
              soap solutions.  A prototype model for these systems consists  of a fourth
              order partial differential equation derived as a generalization  of the
              classical, second order Fisher-Kolmogorov equation.  A parameter gamma 
              multiplies the fourth order spatial derivative, and for gamma equal to zero 
              the equation reduces to the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation.  Thus, the model  has
              been named the Extended Fisher Kolmogorov (EFK) equation in the physics 
              literature.  Depending on the choice of gamma, numerical studies indicate  that
              the set of solutions can become extremely complicated.  Such solutions  include
              monotone transition layers known as ``kinks'', homoclinic orbits,  periodic and
              aperiodic solutions, chaos, and travelling waves.  To prove the  existence of
              these kinds of solutions, the proposer and L.A. Peletier of the  University of
              Leiden, Holland, are using a new analytical method which they  have recently
              developed.  The method has proved successful for proving the  existence of
              kinks, periodic solutions and chaos.  The proposer is now apply-  ing this new
              method to study the formation of wave fronts.  In addition to the  EFK
              equation, the proposer is also studying a wider class of equations.  Of
              particular interest is a model of suspension bridges such as the Golden  Gate
              bridge.  The model is also fourth order, but the nonlinear terms cause  the
              analysis of the equation to be fundamentally different from that of the  EFK
              model.  As with the EFK equation, the proposer is  studying the suspension 
              bridge model in order to understand the mechanisms responsible for complicated 
              pattern formation.  %%%  The primary goal of this research is to obtain an
