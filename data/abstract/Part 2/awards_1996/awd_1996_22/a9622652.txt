Abstract    :
              9622652  Messac  This research planning grant (RPG) project develops a  general
              method for Real-Time hardware-in-the-loop Controller  Design (R Co D) for both
              linear and nonlinear plants. The  method offers various advantages over
              conventional system  design approaches since it integrates several system
              design  activities as well as a physical programming-based  computational
              control method. The physical programming  method is a highly-effective domain
              independent design  optimization method. The ultimate objectives of this
              project  include the development of a theoretical basis for R Co D  method, its
              formulation of a mathematical infrastructure for  its application, and an
              experimental verification to  demonstrate its effectiveness. The effort in this
              planning  grant project lays the necessary ground work toward this  ultimate
              goal.***
