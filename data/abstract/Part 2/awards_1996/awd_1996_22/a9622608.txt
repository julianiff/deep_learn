Abstract    :
              This awards supports the research of Professor D. Grayson to  continue the
              development of Macaulay 2. This system will enable  large scale research
              computing projects dealing with systems of  polynomial equations in many
              variables. He also hopes to work on  the connections between algebraic k-theory
              and motivic  cohomology.     This research is in the field of algebraic
              geometry, one of the  oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which
              blossomed to  the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems 
              that have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures  defined in the
              plane by the simplest of equations, namely  polynomials. Today, the field uses
              methods not only from algebra,  but also from analysis and topology, and
              conversely it is  extensively used in those fields.  Moreover it has proved
              itself  useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer  science,
              cryptography, coding theory and robotics.  The software  being developed here
              will make many previously difficult or  impossible computations in this field
              possible.
