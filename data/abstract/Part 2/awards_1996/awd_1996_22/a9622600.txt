Abstract    :
              An invitational Forum on Teacher Preparation for Deans of Science  and of
              Education will be conducted by the American Association for  the Advancement of
              Science from February 21-23, 1996.  Fifty  institutional teams (each composed
              of a dean of education and a  dean of science from major research universities
              and comprehensive  universities with large teacher preparation programs) will
              attend  the meeting to consider ways in which collaborations among their 
              academic divisions and school personnel can better prepare future  teachers of
              K-12 science and mathematics.  The purposes of the  Forum are (1) to present a
              summary of the research results on the  teaching and learning of science and
              mathematics; (2) to consider  exemplary teacher preparation programs that model
              collaboration  among university science and education departments and local 
              schools or school districts; (3) to engage the deans in discussion  of the
              issues associated with the design and implementation of such  exemplary
              programs; and (4) to inform the deans of opportunities,  such as the National
              Science Foundation's Collaboratives for  Excellence in Teacher Preparation
              program, to engage in large-scale  systemic projects designed to change
              significantly teacher  preparation programs, on a state or regional basis,
              which will  serve as comprehensive national models.  Participants will receive 
              background information prior to the meeting.  Based upon  discussions and
              models presented at the Forum, a workbook,  including recommendations for
              collaborations and the components of  model teacher preparation programs, will
              be produced and made  available to participants and others interested in
              improving  teacher preparation.
