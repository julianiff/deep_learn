Abstract    :
              This award supports an investigation into three problems  involving the theta
              correspondence, the Siegel-Weil formula,  values and derivatives of  Eisenstein
              series and L-functions, and  algebraic cycles on Shimura  varieties. Problem I
              concerns the  basic properties of the local theta  correspondence, especially 
              the question of the first occurence.  Problem II concerns a  possible relation
              between the height pairings of  algebraic  cycles on certain Shimura varieties
              and the Fourier expansions of  central derivatives of Siegel Eisenstein series.
              Problem III   involves the application of the relation of Problem II to the 
              derivative,  at the center of symmetry, of certain Langlands  L-functions,
              generalizing the formula of Gross and Zagier.    The  research falls in the
              general mathematical area of the Langlands   program.The Langlands program is
              part of Number Theory, which is  the study of the  properties of the whole
              numbers and is the  oldest branch of mathematics. From the beginning problems
              in  number theory have  furnished a driving force in creating new  mathematics
              in other  diverse parts of the discipline. The  Langlands program is a  general
              philosophy that connects number  theory with calculus;  it  embodies the modern
              approach to the  study of whole numbers.  Modern number theory is very
              technical  and deep, but it has had  astonishing applications in areas like 
              theoretical computer  science and coding theory.
