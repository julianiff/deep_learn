Abstract    :
                    9622373  Schadler  This Research Equipment Grant will be utilized by the
              Department  of Materials Engineering at Drexel University to upgrade an 
              existing Micro Raman Spectrometer (MRS).  the upgraded MRS will  be used for
              current projects on micromechanical behavior of  graphite/epoxy composites,
              developing MRS to measure three  dimensional states of stress and to study
              toughening of  biocompatible bone implant materials for potential prosthesis 
              applications.  The potential for a breakthrough in understanding  of
              interfacial phenomena is promising.  The capability for  measuring, interfacial
              stress, strain and three dimensional  stress in fiber composites is important
              in understanding  micromechanisms of failure of fiber composites under loading.
                The equipment will also be used by other investigators interested  in diamond
              films.  Because MRS is an unique technique for  measuring the mechanical
              behavior of two phase systems the  results obtained can used to test
              micromechanical models which  require the data that can obtained from this
              technique for  verification and refinement.  ***
