Abstract    :
              9622870  Kac    This grant supports the research of Professor V. Kac to work on 
              various problems in representation theory and mathematical  physics. He will
              study the representation theory of the Lie  algebra of differential operators
              on the circle as well vertex  operators, quantum groups and conformal quantum
              field theory. He  will also study soliton equations, integral representations
              of  affine superalgebras and the relationship between reciprocity  laws in
              number theory and the representation theory of infinite  dimensional groups.   
               This is research that starts out in the field of algebra but  moves beyond
              that to touch both number theory and theoretical  physics.  The reasons for
              these connections are that algebra can  be thought of as the study of symmetry
              in the abstract. As such  algebra has direct applications to areas of physics
              and  chemistry. In particular the modern theory of gauge fields in  physics
              uses this area of algebra extensively and this project  will study some of
              these connections at length. There are also  connections to coding theory and
              the transmission of data across  communication lines.
