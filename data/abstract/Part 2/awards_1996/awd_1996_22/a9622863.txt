Abstract    :
              Abstract  Mirkovic    The main project: geometry of  the loop Grassmannian and 
              applications to representation theory: (i) geometric Langlands conjectures and
              (ii) modular representations.   Here (i) is based  on our minor role in the
              completion  of  Drinfelds project  of constructing  the dual reductive group  
              geometricaly, and (ii)   on  our   observation that the   loop Grassmannian  
              is  the  geometric  setting   for  the localization  of algebraic
              representations  of  split reductive  groups  over arbitrary commutative 
              rings.    Related  projects: (a)  study   of intersection homology sheaves and 
               characteristic  cycles  via the   p-transversal stratifications and  (b)   the
              role  of the  hyperkahler  structure in   representation theory.    A  long 
              term goal   of the above   work is  to relate certain  highly developed parts
              of abstract mathematics  (geometry and number  theory) with  the ideas
              developed  recently by theoretical physicist (particle theory).   Both  of 
              these   developments share   common  mathematical language  of representation
              theory    and certain parts  of  algebraic   geometry.  The  exdpected
              unification should dramaticaly  increase our understanding of both fields.
