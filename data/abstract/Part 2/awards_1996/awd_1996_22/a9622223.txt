Abstract    :
                      962223  Rodriguez  The objective of the combined research program (in
              collaborative  constructability and value engineering) is to reduce life-cycle 
              costs while improving design/construction process performance.  The  research
              program has been coined CREW, or Constructability Review  and Evaluation for
              Workgroups, because it will develop a  collaborative (group) technique for:
              analyzing design alternatives  (value analysis); evaluating their viability
              (simulation); and  electronically-communicating solutions.  The effect of this 
              research on the infrastructure of science and engineering would be  the actual
              development of the CREW technique as well as the  construction communication
              infrastructure and logistics to improve  collaborative construction research
              performance.
