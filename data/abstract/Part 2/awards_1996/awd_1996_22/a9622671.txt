Abstract    :
                      9622671  Dzenis  This Research Equipment Grant to the Departments of
              Engineering  Mechanics and Mechanical Engineering at the University of 
              Nebraska will be used to purchase equipment needed for the study  of failure of
              novel composite materials, durability of adhesive  joints, high temperature
              response of shape memory alloys, post-  yield shape recovery in glassy
              polymers, high temperature  durability of thin films under stress and high
              temperature  applications of metal matrix composites.  The new equipment will 
              replace tan existing MTS 458 controller with a digital MTS  TestStar control
              system and add an environmental control chamber.   This upgrade for the
              equipment is needed as the existing  equipment cannot support the temperature
              range for the research  described in the proposal.  This equipment will be used
              on  research projects that foster interactions between departments  and for
              undergraduate laboratory courses.  ***
