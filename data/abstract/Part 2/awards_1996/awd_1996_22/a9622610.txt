Abstract    :
              Abstract  Prezbinda      This project is concerned with a microlocal study of
              characters and matrix coefficients of irreducible unitary representations of
              classical Lie groups in the context of Howe's theory of real reductive dual
              pairs. The goal is to understand the characters, matrix coefficients and wave
              front sets of such representations in terms of the moment maps which occur  
              naturally in that theory. These are the moment maps of classical invariant
              theory.     The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century
              mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries
              inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had a
              profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and   number
              theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and
              elementary particle physics.  The mathematical techniques, on which this
              particular project is based, are also useful in signal processing, data
              compression and cryptography.
