Abstract    :
              9622282  Sampath  The  Department of Mechanical Engineering at Colorado State
              University will purchase a residual gas analyzer (RGA) and the fixturing
              necessary for installation on our existing vacuum processing equipment.  This
              processing equipment incorporates a unique technology, developed in our
              laboratory.  This technology allows substrates for semiconductor and optical
              film processing to be transported directly from air into  a vacuum environment
              where film growth can occur then back to air (AVA) with the transportation of
              substrates taking place in under a second.  This novel capability allows very
              precise control over film growth.  Unique processing and growth conditions are
              possible with the AVA technology.  Furthermore, sample processing effort and
              experimental variability have been greatly decreased..  ***
