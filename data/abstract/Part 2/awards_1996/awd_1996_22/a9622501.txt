Abstract    :
              9622501  Vetelino  This proposal  requests that NSF cost share in the purchase
              of piezoelectric sensor fabrication equipment which will be vital to the
              University of  Maine (UM) sensor efforts and a valuable asset to other UM
              researchers and industry.  The design, fabrication and testing of piezoelectric
              sensors is an active area at the UM.  These sensors, which are sensitive,
              portable, small, and inexpensive,  can detect gases in the parts per (SAW) gas
              microsensor, the application of neural networks to SAW gas sensors, an acoustic
              plate mode biosensor, a SAW corrosion sensor, an acoustic emission sensor, a
              sensor for making nylon and an automotive oil quality sensor.  The proposed
              fabrication equipment is also critical to a large NSF-funded multi-user thin
              film synthesis and processing facility and an NSF funded program which
              integrates sensors into the undergraduate and graduate electrical engineering
              (EE) curricula.  Since the present fabrication equipment is unreliable, sensor
              research has been slowed, impediments to exploring new research directions have
              arisen, and the integration of sensors into the curriculum has been difficult.
