Abstract    :
              This project focuses on exploring the role of structural identification in
              transforming the current semi-empirical practice to a rational knowledge-base,
              thereby paving the way for effective and optimum infrastructure designing
              operation and management.  Fundamental questions pertaining to the use of
              structural identification for bridge structures will be answered.  The research
              will be primarily focused on structural identification in terms of data
              processing, quality assurance, damage evaluation, and reliability evaluation. 
              The experimental and analytical tools that permit meaningful and practical
              applications of structural identification are only presently emerging.  A test
              bridge has already been instrumented which is a 10 year old, 188 ft long,
              three-span, two lane, integral abutment, reinforced
              concrete-deck-on-steel-girders overpass in the Cincinnati area to provide
              needed test data.  Another bridge is under construction and is being
              instrumented with over 350 sensors.  Accelerations, displacements, rotations,
              strains, temperatures, truck-loads and environmental conditions will be
              monitored over the long-term by intelligent monitoring systems.  In addition to
              active and passive sensors, photogrammetric image-processing technologies will
              be used.  The structural identification experiments will include:  modal
              testing by impact, modal testing by multi-input forced-excitation,
              geometry-monitoring, traffic-inputs and operating responses, environmental
              inputs and ambient responses, static proof-level multiple truck-loading, etc. 
              A wide variety of structural identification approaches and analytical tools
              will be studied.
