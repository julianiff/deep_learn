Abstract    :
                  9622526  Boyce  This project will study the mechanical behavior of
              amorphorous  polymers which undergo strain-induced crystallization.  These 
              polymers begin in the amorphous state, but during deformation  processing near
              the glass transition temperature and at certain  stress-strain states, will
              crystallize.  Such crystallization  acts to further increase their stiffness
              and strength beyond that  due to their molecular orientation.  However the
              crystallization  does not occur at all stress-strain states and in fact
              sometimes  decreases in stiffness or strength.  While this is clearly 
              fundamental research, it is also directly applicable to real  polymer
              processing operations and products.  ***
