Abstract    :
              CTS-9622222  Koster     This is an award to upgrade the equipment necessary for
              liquid metal fluid mechanics and solidification studies.  This equipment will
              be used in a laboratory devoted to the visualization of opaque liquid melts. 
              This equipment upgrade will integrate the knowledge acquired during the early
              development stage and will extend the capabilities of the laboratory to include
              metallurgical characterization.  The new equipment package includes a
              replacement image amplifier tube, a replacement X-ray source tube and a high
              resolution tube camera.  the grant will also cover the purchase of metal
              polishing equipment, crystal orientation equipment, electrical demarcation
              equipment, an optical microscope and resistivity measurement equipment.
