Abstract    :
                The objective of this project is to obtain a quantitative  understanding of
              magnetospheric hudromagnetic modes and their  coupling to external and internal
              sources of free energy, such as  the ring current.  Three interrelated areas of
              study will be  followed: (1) inner magnetospheric cavity modes, (2) general 
              properties of field line resonance modes, and (3) excitation of 
              internally-driven field line resonance modes by energetic ring  current
              particles.  Key questions to be examined are: (1) what is  the cavity mode
              structure in the inner magnetosphere and the  frequencies one should expect to
              see in ground and satellite  magnetic data and what is the efficiency of
              transport from the  outer magnetosphere, (2) what controls the field line
              resonant mode  radial structure, and (3) what causes the nonlinear saturation
              of  the drift-bounce resonant mode, and what is the self-consistent  effect of
              the mode on ion motion.  The methods to be employed are:  (1) for the cavity
              mode study, eigenmode analysis in dipole and  general geometry and MHD
              simulations, (2) for the field line  resonance mode study, MHD simulations in
              box and dipole geometry  including finite Larmor radius effects as well as
              ionospheric  damping, and (3) for the study of internally-driven field line 
              resonance modes, hybrid MHD/gyrokinetic simulations in box and  dipole
              geometry.  The goal is to incorporate the key physics which  has not yet been
              included in studies of these modes.  Comparisons  with spacecraft data will be
              made to test the theoretical  predictions and yield new insights into observed
              wave properties  and associated particle measurements.
