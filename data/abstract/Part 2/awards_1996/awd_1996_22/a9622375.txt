Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9622375    A gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS)
              combination and a gel permeation chromatograph (GPC) are acquired.  These will
              be used for the elucidation of reaction mechanisms of environmentally benign
              processes.  Specific projects include enhancing resource recovery from
              polystyrene using base catalysis; identifying novel high-performance polyimide
              structures that exhibit improved thermal stability; and developing robust
              metal-oxide-based catalysts for efficient nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction in
              lean-burn systems.
