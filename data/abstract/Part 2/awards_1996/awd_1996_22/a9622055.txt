Abstract    :
              Tippur  9622055  The  proposed research is aimed at developing a  fundamental 
              knowledge base concerning mechanical integrity, particularly  fracture,  in  a
              class of new materials called  Functionally  Graded   Materials  (FGM).  
              Failure  characterization   and  performance  evaluation  relative  to 
              piecewise-homogeneous  compositions  and  identification of  appropriate 
              materials  property   gradients  for  best  performance  are  currently 
              lacking.   The  proposed  research will  provide  full-field  information 
              about the nature of stresses  and  deformations  near  cracks in FGMs under
              quasi-static and dynamic  loading  conditions.   A  relatively  new  optical 
              technique  called  "Coherent  Gradient  Sensing" (CGS) will  be  used  for  the
               direct measurement of crack tip displacement components  and  of  the  local
              mixed-mode deformations as a function of  the  applied loading.  ***
