Abstract    :
              9622843  Aschbacher    This grant supports the research of Professor M.
              Aschbacher to work on three different areas in finite group theory. The first
              problem is to give a unified treatment of the existence and uniqueness of the
              finite sporadic simple groups. The next problem is to work on a complete
              treatment of the classification of quasithin groups. Finally, he intends to
              study finite group actions on certain topological and geometric objects, with
              special attention to Hirzebruch's prize question.     This is research in the
              field of group theory. Group theory can be thought of as the study of symmetry
              in the abstract. As such, this area has direct applications to many areas of
              physics and chemistry. Moreover, within the last 30 years, many connections to
              problems in data transmission have been solved using techniques from group
              theory. There are also direct connections to the error correcting codes that
              are vital for modern computing such as working with CD-ROM's.
