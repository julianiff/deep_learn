Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9622235    A high-speed rotating drum camera and the components to
              build a particle field holography system which will be purchased to supporting
              research in multiphase flows.  The equipment will be used to generate a analyze
              data in two independent research programs:  the high-speed breakup of
              viscoelastic and Newtonian liquids in a mach 6 shock tube, and the dynamic
              behavior of turbulent particle-laden flows.    The objective of the breakup
              project is to generate the first systematic data and the first understanding of
              how viscoelastic liquids breakup when exposed to supersonic flows.  The drum
              camera will provide data on the mechanisms governing the breakup event, which
              is essentially complete in less than 500 ( sec.  The particle field holography
              system will provide three-dimensional data on the size, shape, and distribution
              of the fragments after initial breakup.    The objective of the particle-laden
              flow project is to understand the dynamical behavior of turbulent flows that
              are laden with particles or fibers.  The drum camera will provide high
              resolution, high repetition rate sequences of flow events.  The holography
              system will yield three-dimensional information on fiber orientation and
              flocculation.  ***
