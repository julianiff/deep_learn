Abstract    :
              9622426  Johnson   The research involves developing accurate models of traffic
              processes in queueing models for designing and operating communications and
              manufacturing systems.   The usual assumptions for making the models
              analytically tractable such as Poissonian flow is generally not adequate to
              capture the complex nature of real traffic processes in these applications.  A
              methodology is needed for identifying traffic-process descriptors for gaining
              accurate performance measures from the queueing models.  Once adequate
              descriptors are defined, appropriate queueing models must be developed.  One
              such promising descriptor is traffic burstiness and research effort is required
              to quantify it.  Then, appropriate queueing models must be developed to reflect
              the quantified burstiness descriptor.     Finding more realistic queueing
              representations of traffic process in communications and manufacturing would
              add immeasurable to the design and operation of these crucial systems.  This
              research, in combining process descriptor development with queueing model
              development, is a sound approach which should produce useful results toward
              this end and add to the theory of queueing models in these areas.
