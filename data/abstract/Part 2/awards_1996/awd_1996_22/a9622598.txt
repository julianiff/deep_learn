Abstract    :
              9622598  Greenstein    Telecommunications is an industry which is undergoing
              rapid  change and renewed competition.  In this era, there is still no  general
              agreement about the appropriate approach for encouraging  modernization of the
              regulated U.S. telephone system.    This research will specifically look at the
              impact of regulation  on modernization through local exchange companies'
              adoption of  digital infrastructure.  Prior research has found that various 
              forms of incentive regulation, and in particular price  regulation, has led to
              greater deployment of digital  infrastructure than has traditional rate of
              return regulation.   In addition that price regulation works more effectively
              than  earnings-sharing schemes, although price regulation works better  paired
              with earnings-sharing schemes than when used alone.  The  proposed research
              builds on this previous research by looking at  the political influences on
              adoption of particular regulatory  schemes and on the speed of adoption of
              digital infrastructure.   A data set which includes political variables will be
              constructed  to facilitate this research.
