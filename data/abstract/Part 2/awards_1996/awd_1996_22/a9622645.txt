Abstract    :
              CMS-9622645  Ernian Pan  University of Colorado    A two-dimensional coupled
              boundary element and edge function  method  (BEM/EFM) is proposed for the first
              time to study rock  fracture propagation  problems.  The most outstanding
              features of this combination  are its  ability to handle complex crack
              geometries and to simulate  crack  propagation without discretization along
              crack surfaces.  In  addition, any  kind of rock anisotropy can be handled and
              the effect of a  gravity body  force will also be considered.
