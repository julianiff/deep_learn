Abstract    :
              9622200  Hearn   A SPARC station 20 Multiprocessor Workstation with Solaris User
              Environment and two 75 Mhz Processors will be acquired to support research in
              the Center for Applied Optimization where a mix of applied and fundamental
              projects are conducted.  The research will focus on the major areas of applied
              optimization and algorithm research.  The particular projects to be focused
              upon are:  (1) decision modeling for water management, involving development of
              models and algorithms for determining optimal alternative water supply
              strategies; (2) bounded flow approach to congestion pricing using new nonlinear
              programming and variational inequality methods to determine system optimal
              tolls for controlling congestion in urban street networks; (3) computational
              algorithm development  for new lower bound heuristics and exact algorithms to
              solve classes of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems;  and (4)
              molecular conformation and protein folding algorithm development and
              implementation for global minimization of nonconvex energy functions.   The
              equipment will improve the research environment of the important projects
              identified above.  The equipment will make an already productive center even
              more so.  The improvements to the infrastructure should lead to new discoveries
              or fundamental advances.
