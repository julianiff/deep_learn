Abstract    :
              9622106  Boyd   This research focuses on models and solution methodologies for
              minimizing fuel consumption in compressor-driven flow networks.  Recent
              advances in the fields of discrete optimization and large-scale integer
              programming will be employed, and solution algorithms will be developed on
              parallel computing platforms.  The domain of feasible solutions prescribed by
              the models is mathematically complicated by virtue of the existence of both
              nonlinearities and discontinuities.  Classical techniques are wholly inadequate
              for many of the large and growing pipeline networks in operation today. 
              Necessary mathematical results will be developed for obtaining optimization
              algorithms, first, for the steady-state case, and then, for the transient case.
               Intelligent search procedures will be developed and mixed-integer linear
              programming models will be developed for the steady-state case.  Based on the
              experience gained in the steady-state analysis, an algorithm for solving the
              transient case will be developed.   Results of this research can be used to
              operate existing networks efficiently, to evaluate tradeoffs between safety and
              throughput, and to design safe and energy-efficient new networks.  The direct
              impact of the research will be applicable methods for reducing operating costs
              and pollutants generated by the thousands of gas pipeline networks in operation
              throughout the world.  A better understanding of a little-studied class of
              network flow problems with broad applicability in a variety of industries will
              also result.
