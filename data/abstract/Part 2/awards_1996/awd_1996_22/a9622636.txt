Abstract    :
              This is a joint project between Dimitri Bertsekas, MIT and Andrea Goldsmith,
              Caltech.    The scarcity of channel capacity to support emerging multimedia
              wireless applications requires efficient strategies for using the available 
              bandwidth.  Any system using fixed frequency reuse and base station assignment
              must be designed relative to worst-case interference assumptions.  Dynamic
              resource allocation is a more efficient strategy, where frequencies, base
              stations, data rates, and power levels are dynamically assigned relative to
              current and potential system conditions.    In this work, we propose to
              formulate the general resource allocation problem as an optimization problem
              subject to interference constraints.  The cost function is very general.  It
              can incorporate most of the practical systems complexity in the optimization
              framework, including cell handoff due to user mobility, multiple classes of
              traffic, and channel variation.  We consider both FDMA and CDMA methods of
              dividing up the available systems band width.  We will apply linear programming
              to minimize the instantaneous cost function, and dynamic programming techniques
              to minimize the cost function over the infinite horizon.  The dynamic problem
              formulation will utilize recent developments in neuro-dynamic programming
              techniques.
