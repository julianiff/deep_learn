Abstract    :
              9622431  Prakash  A study will be made of the high speed shear deformation of 
              surfaces under varying normal pressures and at various  temperatures.  From the
              shear deformation behavior the  frictional forces will be determined and it is
              intended to  eventually build a constitutive model for interfacial  friction. 
              Two different experiments will be performed to  obtain complementary data.  One
              uses a conventional split  Hopkinson bar to simulate rubbing of surfaces in
              contact  under varying normal stress.  The other uses a modified high  speed
              impact apparatus where two parallel plates are  impacted at high speed.  By
              varying the speed of impact and  the inclination of the plates, both normal
              forces and  surface traction forces can be varied.  Tangential  displacements
              are measured optically and are used to with  one-dimensional wave theory to
              derive variations of shear  stress and slip velocity with time.  ***
