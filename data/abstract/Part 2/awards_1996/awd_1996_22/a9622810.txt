Abstract    :
              9622810  Tian       The main themes on the project are I. Nonlinear Dispersive 
              Oscillations,     II. Hele-Shaw Flows and III. Stokes Flows. In project I, the 
              main     purpose is to analyze the generation and propagation of  oscillations 
                 described by the defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation as  dispersion   
               goes to zero. Microscopically, the oscillations propagate  according to    
              the Whitham equations. The proposed method is a construction  of solutions    
              of the Whitham equations via a hodograph transform. Both  projects II     and
              III concern the motion of an interface between a more  viscous     fluid and a
              less viscous fluid to be regarded as invicid. The  viscous     fluid is
              governed by Darcy's law in the second project, and by  the     Stokes equations
              in the last one. The emphases are on the  types of     singularity formation in
              the presence of surface tension,  Hele-Shaw     and Stokes flows in dimension
              3. The proposed methods will be  both     analytical and computational.  %%%   
                Nonlinear dispersive oscillations can be observed in  collisionless shocks   
               in plasmas and optical shocks in optical fibers. What is  fascinating    
              about this phenomenon is the phase transition between  different regions.    
              The goal is to understand the phase transition from  non-oscillatory     to
              oscillatory regions. Both Hele-Shaw and Stokes flows are  flows in     porous
              media. It is well known that the interface will be  unstable     when a less
              viscous fluid drives a more viscous fluid. This  instability     is responsible
              for water flooding of oil wells, and is of  obvious     importance to oil
              reservoir engineering. The aim is to  understand this     instability in
              detail. The principal investigator proposes to  use     some new analytical and
              numerical techniques to study these  problems.  ***
