Abstract    :
              DMS-9622434  Dadarlat  Purdue University Research Fdn    The investigator will
              continue his work on Elliott's program  of classifying simple or real rank zero
              nuclear C*-algebras by  K-theoretical and tracial invariants.  This will
              involve research directed toward developing a local theory of  approximately
              multiplicative completely positive maps of nuclear  C*-algebras with algebraic
              invariants based on ordered mod-p K-theory.  In a related direction the
              investigator will pursue the classification  of simple or real rank zero
              subhomogeneous C*-algebras whose local spectra  may have arbitrary dimension
              growth. He will study applications of  the classification results into
              dynamics.     C*-algebras can be thought as  collections of infinite matrices
              of complex   numbers displaying a rich algebraic structure.  They correspond to
              a new idea of space: non-commutative or quantum space.  Many singular spaces
              that are needed in the various areas of mathematics  and physics can be
              successfully replaced by  non-commutative C*-algebras.  Remarkably, many of the
              tools of measure theory, topology, dynamics  and differential geometry have
              powerful extensions to this non-commutative  setting.
