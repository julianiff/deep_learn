Abstract    :
              CTS-9622108  Elliott     This is an award to support the purchase a Nd:YAG
              pulsed laser and intensified CCD camera system which will dedicated to research
              in mechanical and aerospace engineering.  The first project will be to develop
              a laser based diagnostic technique termed Filtered Angularly Resolved Rayleigh
              Scattering (FARRS).  this will be a non-intrusive flow diagnostic technique
              that will have the ability to measure instantaneous velocity, density,
              temperature, and pressure. The successful development of FARRS will aid in a
              better understanding of complex flow phenomena and the development of more
              accurate computer simulation schemes.
