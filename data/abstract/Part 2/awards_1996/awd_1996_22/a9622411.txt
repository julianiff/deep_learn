Abstract    :
              9622411  Moore  This proposal supports the purchase of tissue and cellular 
              engineering equipment which will be dedicated to support research  in
              engineering at Florida International University.  The  equipment will be used
              for several research projects, including  in particular a study entitled "Flow
              and Stretch Effects on  Vascular Endothelial Cells."  This project aims to
              quantitatively  identify how the mechanical environment in arteries affects the
               formation of atherosclerosis.  The cells that line the inner  surfaces of
              arteries are subjected to both shear stress from the  flow of blood, and the
              circumferential stress that results from  the radial expansion of the artery
              during heart contraction.  Previous research has concentrated on either shear
              stress or  radial expansion, but not both.  In this research, cells will be 
              cultured onto the inner surfaces of tubes which behave  mechanically like
              arteries, then subjected to realistic  mechanical conditions including both
              shear stress and radial  expansion.  The secretion of substances thought to be
              important  in the formation of atherosclerosis will be measured using modern 
              biological techniques.  Other projects directed by the principal  investigator
              that will benefit from this equipment include flow  studies in the coronary
              arteries and flow analysis of vascular  stents.  Within the PI's department,
              there are at least five  other projects that will be able to make use of the
              proposed  equipment.  ***
