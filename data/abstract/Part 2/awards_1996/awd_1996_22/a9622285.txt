Abstract    :
              9622285  Lempert     The proposed research lies in the area of several complex
              variables. The investigator wishes to study how the property of embeddability
              of Cauchy-Riemann manifolds behaves when the Cauchy-Riemann structure is
              perturbed. In addition, the investigator plans to study various properties of
              infinite dimensional complex manifolds: the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann
              equations in Hilbert spaces, the extension of the Newlander-Nirenberg theorem
              and the Oka principle are among the topics pursued.    Spaces based on complex
              numbers arise in many natural settings. For example, polynomial equations in
              general can not be solved unless one works in a (finite dimensional) complex
              space. The proposed research deals with abstract complex spaces and infinite
              dimensional complex spaces.
