Abstract    :
              9622858  Chen    The investigator will study various Boussinesq systems which
              describe the   two-way propagation of  water waves in nonlinear, dispersive
              media.   Boussinesq systems with various approximate dissipative terms will
              also be   studied theoretically and numerically. Generally speaking, all the
              issues   studied for the famous KdV-equation, which describes waves traveling
              in   one direction, should be investigated.    The major goal for this project
              is to decide which system of equations and   which  dissipative mechanism is
              best suited for the modeling of physical   problems in fluid mechanics.  The
              ideal system should at least be   mathematically sound, physically correct,
              have the least complexity, and   can be used to simulate a wide range of real
              water wave problems.
