Abstract    :
              This is an investigation into the application of asynchronous circuit design 
              tools to a large, realistic example.  The project is being carried out in 
              conjunction with the Avalanche parallel architecture project at the University 
              of Utah.  The Cache and Communication Control Unit (CCCU) of the Avalanche 
              multiprocessor, which is designed as a synchronous system, is being implemented
               as a self-timed system using the original specification for the Avalanche
              CCCU.   To do this, problems in self-timed circuit design are being deeply
              investigated,  with a particular focus on automating the design of
              high-performance self-timed  systems.  Chips embodying the designs are being
              fabricated through MOSIS, tested  and evaluated.
