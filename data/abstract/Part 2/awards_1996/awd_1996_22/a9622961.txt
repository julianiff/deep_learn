Abstract    :
              9622961  Huang    This grant supports the research of Professor Y. Huang to work
              on various problems in the theory of vertex operators and conformal field
              theory. He wishes to study higher-genus conformal field theories, especially
              their applications to geometry and topology. He also hopes to study geometric
              constructions related to Virasoro algebras, sigma models, and the geometry of
              the monster sporadic group.     This is research that starts out in the field
              of algebra but moves beyond that to touch both number theory and theoretical
              physics.  The reasons for these connections are that algebra can be though of
              as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As such algebra has direct
              applications to areas of physics and chemistry. In particular the modern theory
              of gauge fields in physics uses this area of algebra extensively and this
              project will study some of these connections at length. There are also
              connections to coding theory and the transmission of data across communication
              lines.
