Abstract    :
              CMS-9622670    The deformation of soils in the field and laboratory are 
              commonly observed  to concentrate in shear bands formed during failure by 
              strain localization.  While this mechanism is widely appreciated by
              geotechnical  engineers, it  remains difficult to account for this in the
              numerical  solutions.  This  research is the analytical/computational component
              of a  collaborative  research project which includes the University of Southern
               California  (USC), Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), and two  French
              engineering  institutions - the Institute Mecanique de Grenoble (IMG) and  the
              Ecole  Centrale de Paris (ECP).  The research will build on the  experimental 
              investigations at CWRU, IMG, and ECP to develop the  analytical/computational
              framework for strain localization  based on finite  element implementation of
              gradient-dependent plasticity, and  including  account of the diffusion of pore
              water during undrained  tests.    The experimental and analytical program will
              lead to a  better understanding  of the phenomenon of bifurcation and
              localization, and to  analytical  methods for analyzing strain localization not
              only in  laboratory specimens,  but also in practical boundary value problems
              in  geotechnical engineering.  ***
