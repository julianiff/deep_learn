Abstract    :
                    9622241  Lambros  This Research Equipment Grant will be used by the
              Department of  Mechanical Engineering at the University of Delaware to purchase
               a high speed infra red radiation detector system to measure the  temperature
              increase during dynamic deformation of polymer matrix  composites, ceramics and
              ceramic composites.  It is planned to  measure the temperature fields generated
              during dynamic  deformation and fracture of these advanced materials.  The 
              results of a complete study of the coupling between damage and  thermal effects
              in these materials is needed for the formulation  of physically meaningful and
              accurate thermomechanical damage  models for advanced materials and composites.
               This is an  important aspect of material behavior which deserves careful 
              study, especially in advanced materials.  This equipment will be  used in
              several current research projects and will also be  available for use by other
              faculty at the University.  ***
