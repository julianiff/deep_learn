Abstract    :
              9629903  Cormier         This is a research planning grant (RPG). The PI will 
              synthesize available data on the East Pacific Rise from 12 north to  15 30
              north out to seafloor of age 4-5 my. The PI will determine if  there is any
              evidence for along-axis variations in crustal  structure and/or mantle
              temperature associated with the pronounced  variation an axial morphology, and
              if there is  any evidence that  the propagating event is related to a local
              increase in the melt  supply to the ridge axis.
