Abstract    :
              9629276  O'Day  The proposed research program of this Faculty Early Career
              Development proposal  involves: (1) Spectroscopic and microscopic
              characterization of field samples from Pinal Creek, AZ. and (2) model studies
              of  Zn sorption and precipitation and the characterization of reaction products
              by X-ray absorption spectroscopy.  During the first phase, the PI would like to
              directly verify the chemical state and distribution of Co, Ni, CU and Zn
              associated with solid phases in the stream bed and alluvial sediments, and
              determine the nature and amount of amorphous and crystalline phases. Part 2
              will focus on two aspects of  the Zn (II) sorption system: (I) The influence of
              mineral substrate on uptake and release of Zn and the identification of
              coordination change with sorption with XAS, and (ii) the local molecular
              structure and kinetics of Zn(OH)2 homogenous precipitation and surface
              precipitation.  Sample characterization will be done by SIMS and probe.
              Analytical methods to be used include TEM, PEELS, and XAS.
