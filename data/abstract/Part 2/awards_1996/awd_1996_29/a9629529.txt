Abstract    :
              9629529  Janzen  For most animals gender is determined by the chromosomes.  In
              several groups of vertebrate animals gender is determined by the temperature
              experienced during embryonic development.  This project will investigate the
              biology of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in a natural
              population of the turtle Chrysemys picta.    It will consider how egg size,
              nest-site selection, and predation affect offspring survival and sex ratio. 
              Nesting females will be followed from year to year to study nest-site
              consistency.  This project will help explain why some groups of animals have
              their gender determined by temperature rather than by chromosomes.  This
              extends understanding of what affects fertility and sex ratio in natural
              populations.  This project will show how habitat use and predators affect
              population dynamics in animals with TSD.  Many such species are endangered and
              this information can help their conservation.
