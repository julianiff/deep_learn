Abstract    :
              9629735  Rossiter    Impact of Heavy Metals on DNA Damage and Survival in Two
              Grasshopper Species    Pollution,  particularly heavy metal contamination of
              soil and waterways, often causes species to become locally extinct.  To assess
              the impact of toxin pollution in a community or an ecosystem, we usually
              measure which species are present and which are absent.  While this approach
              offers a good method for the expedient delivery of information for safety
              recommendations concerning human and ecosystem health, we are still in the dark
              about why some species go locally extinct and others are able to withstand
              toxin stress.  In other words, we know nothing about the changes in population
              quality which precede local extinction or adaptation as a result of toxin
              stress.  The goal of this work is to learn new techniques to examine this
              issue.  Using grasshoppers as a model system, Dr. Rossiter will subject insects
              to a range of lead doses at several points in their lives.  Their response will
              be measured in terms of behavior, development, and DNA integrity.  This will
              provide  baseline data for interpreting the impact of toxins on population
              quality and suggest which traits might be used to determine the health of 
              "indicator species", those species whose presence or absence gives information
              on the health of the local community.
