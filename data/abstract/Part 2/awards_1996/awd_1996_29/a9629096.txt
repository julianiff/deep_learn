Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9629096  Moore    The proposed activity comprises the planning for
              and dissemination of information about the establishment of an affiliate Center
              to the Center for Glass Research at Alfred University, an Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center currently in its first renewal period and supported
              by twenty-six companies.  The University of Missouri-Rolla affiliate is
              projected to have 5-10 corporate partners supporting research into
              glass-contact refractory materials, specifically research focused on corrosion
              and creep processes in glasstank and regenerator refractories and on-line
              monitoring of glass melter wall refractories.      The planning activity is to
              culminate in a research planning meeting of prospective corporate members who
              will review a proposed array of products (summarized in this proposal) and then
              be invited to join the UMR site affiliate tot he CGR at Alfred University.
