Abstract    :
              The Julia Robinson Celebration of Women in Mathematics                          
               Project Abstract    The 25th anniversary of the Association of Women in
              Mathematics  (AWM) will  be celebrated in 1996, culminating in a conference
              entitled the  Julia  Robinson Celebration of Women in  Mathematics. The goals
              of the  celebration  are:  - to showcase the recent achievements of women in
              mathematics;  - to facilitate networking among women in various fields of 
              mathematics;  - to provide role models and offer mentoring for beginning women 
              mathematicians;  - outreach to area teachers and students.    The Celebration
              will be a 2 1/2 day conference to be held July  1-3, 1996,  at the Mathematical
              Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in  Berkeley,  California. The goals will be
              accomplished by the following  events:  - 10-12 lectures by women in pure and
              applied mathematics who are  in  various stages of their careers;  - workshops
              focussed on career issues for beginning  mathematicians in both  academia and
              industry;  - a Conversation on the topic of Women and Mathematics to be held 
              with area  high school and junior high school teachers and students.
