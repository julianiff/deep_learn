Abstract    :
                      9629018  Wysession    The P.I.'s research involves using seismology to
              map the interior of the Earth, and interpreting these maps to understand the
              big picture of what our planet is made of and how it works.  Just as medical
              doctors use a sonogram or CAT-scan to image a patient,  he uses the reflecting
              and refracting waves from large earthquakes to image the Earth.  This most
              significant contributions have come through the mapping of the highly variable
              boundary between Earth's core and mantle, half-way to the center of our planet.
               This information has helped change the ways geologists perceive the dynamic
              processes at work inside the Earth.  Over the next five years he will continue
              to develop his research program in the mapping of Earth structure in several
              directions.  He will concentrate on the core-mantle boundary region, but will
              examine other regions of the Earth, including the Earth's core, the olivine
              phase transitions at depths of 410 and 660 km, and the upper mantle structure
              beneath spreading plate boundaries.
