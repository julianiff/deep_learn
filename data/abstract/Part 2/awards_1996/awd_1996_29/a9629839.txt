Abstract    :
              9629839  Chubukov  The work proposed in this grant involves a careful 
              theoretical study of the antiferromagnetic cuprates as they  are doped and
              transform from an insulating commensurate  antiferromagnet to a metallic,
              superconducting state.  The  project contains both analytical and numerical
              approaches.  Specifically one part of the project contains a study of the 
              evolution with doping of the Fermi surface of vacancies, of  the density of
              states and the vertex corrections to the d-  wave superconducting pairing.  Yet
              another project involves  a careful analysis of the two magnon Raman scattering
              in  undoped and lightly doped regimes.  Finally there are plans  to investigate
              the critical behavior of a frustrated quantum  antiferromagnet.  %%%  The high
              Tc superconducting materials start out as an  insulating antiferromagnet before
              they are doped and  transformed into metallic superconductors.  This project by
               a young assistant professor, concerns a careful and detailed  study, using a
              variety of techniques, of the evolution of  these materials as they are doped. 
              The study is of critical  importance in understanding the mysterious properties
              of  these materials including the appearance of high temperature 
              superconductivity.  ***
