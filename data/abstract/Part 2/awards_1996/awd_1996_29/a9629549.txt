Abstract    :
              The ability of a few insect species to use chemical compounds acquired from
              their host plants to defend themselves against their own predators, has
              fascinated biologists for over a century.  Nevertheless, relatively little is
              known about the biochemical mechanisms that enable only a few species to store
              these compounds.  Dr. Bowers will use DNA sequencing to determine the
              evolutionary relationships among a group of butterflies which has species that
              can store toxic compounds, iridoid glycosides, and species that cannot.  This
              phylogeny will then be used to examine the evolution of hostplant use patterns
              in  this insect group and the evolution of the biochemical mechanisms enabling
              some species to store these compounds.    The results of this research will
              provide a phylogenetic framework in which to examine the evolution of
              unpalatability in insects.  Dr. Bowers will apply the techniques learned during
              this year to many aspects of her future research and her training of students
              in evolutionary ecology.  Understanding the mechanisms that enable insects to
              cope with chemical compounds they encounter in their hostplants may also inform
              our understanding of how insects cope with chemical compounds, such as
              pesticides and herbicides, that have more recently become a part of their
              environment.
