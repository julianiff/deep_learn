Abstract    :
              9629577  Paulson     Alkenes are important chemical species for the formation of
              oxidizing compounds within the troposphere.  On a global scale, alkenes
              comprise the majority of non-methane hydrocarbon emissions, and roughly half of
              the carbon that reacts through an ozone-alkene chemical reaction, does so by
              forming short-lived Criegee reaction intermediates.  The research supported by
              this award is expected to make significant contributions to the understanding
              of the mechanism of ozone-alkene reactions in the troposphere, especially those
              involving photochemical reactions of biogenic alkenes with tropospheric ozone. 
                The project examines the kinetics and mechanism of ozone-alkene reactions
              using Teflon batch reactors in conjunction with GC/FID/MS, gas phase FTIR
              spectroscopy and FTIR/matrix isolation analytical techniques. The experimental
              approach focuses on the decomposition and reaction pathways of Criegee reaction
              intermediates. Study of the chemical reaction mechnisms involving Criegee
              intermediates has important possibilities for understanding the processes that
              control the formation of oxidants in the troposphere.  Overall,  the goals
              described in the research project would lead to a significant improvement of
              our understanding of atmospheric reactions involving alkenes, and hence of air
              pollution and tropospheric chemistry.  ATM-9629353
