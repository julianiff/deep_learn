Abstract    :
              Character displacement describes an ecological pattern where populations of
              competing species, morphologically similar when occurring in separate habitats,
              diverge morphologically when occurring in the same habitat.  Few studies have
              experimentally tested the character displacement hypothesis.  This project
              provides a test of a prediction of the character displacement hypothesis by
              measuring natural selection arising from ecological processes involved in
              competitive interactions.  The investigators will use natural arenas to measure
              natural selection on body size in two co-occurring lizard species.  Transplant
              experiments will be performed that involve populations of these species that
              occur in the same and separate habitats.  Tests of ecological mechanisms, such
              as prey size distributions and micro-habitat partitioning, will be integrated
              with the transplant experiments.    Understanding the heritable basis of
              important traits like body size and growth rate in free-ranging animals is
              profoundly important for many husbandry programs.  This project will contribute
              to our understanding of the amount of heritable variation in body size in
              natural populations and how this variation is shaped by natural selection. 
              Results of this project are applicable to husbandry programs that involve two
              or more species  such as aquaculture programs, or free-ranging domesticated
              programs where some selection might be expected to occur.
