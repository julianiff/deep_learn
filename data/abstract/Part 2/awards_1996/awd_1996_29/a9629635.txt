Abstract    :
              ***  9629635  Silva  The "International Workshop on Future Directions in the 
              Repair and Rehabilitation of Concrete Structures" will be  held in Maracaibo,
              Venezuela on February, 1997.  Renowned  researches and consultants from Latin
              America, the United  States and Europe with present state-of-the-art R&R

              rehabilitation of  concrete structures with steel reinforcement.  Prevention
              and  remediation techniques for corrosion mechanisms will be given  special
              attention.  The interaction among experts from  different countries climates
              environmental conditions and  practices, but who face similar problems, will
              allow useful  exchanges of information, help to set effective research 
              priorities, and stimulate collaborative projects.  The  participants will also
              have the unique opportunity of  examining the R&R work on one of the first and
