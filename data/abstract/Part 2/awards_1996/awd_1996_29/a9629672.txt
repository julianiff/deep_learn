Abstract    :
                This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the
               Division of Chemistry and in the Atmospheric Chemistry Program of the Division
               of Atmospheric Sciences, focusses on the development of an instrument and 
              methodology for real time chemical analysis of size-selected particles in the 
              0.5 - 100 nanometer diameter range.  The instrument to be developed couples an 
              ion trap with a reflecting-field time-of-flight mass spectrometer.  Professor 
              Murray V. Johnston and his students in the Department of Chemistry at the 
              University of Delaware will construct this instrument and apply it to problems 
              in nucleation, atmospheric chemistry, smog dynamics, combustion, and other 
              areas of small particle science.  There presently are no methods for doing
              chemical analyses on very small  particles that are sorted according to size. 
              This project, led by Professor  Murray V. Johnston and his research group at
              the University of Delaware,  focusses on building an instrument that couples an
              ion trap with a reflecting-  field time-of-flight mass spectrometer so that
              such analyses can be done.   This instrument will be used to solve problems in
              many areas of small particle  science including atmospheric chemistry, smog
              dynamics, nucleation, and  combustion.
