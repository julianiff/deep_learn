Abstract    :
              9629692  Milton   The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in the
              Mathematical   Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for
              exchange of mathematical   scientists between academia and industry at
              different stages of their careers. These   programs will strengthen the links
              between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of
              research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Industry   Postdoctoral
              Research Fellowships provide two years of support for recent recipients of  
              doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. These awards are a means of
              contributing   to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation.
              The postdoctoral fellow will   work closely with scientific advisors from both
              academia and industry.   The postdoctoral fellow, David J. Eyre, will work
              under the direction of Joseph V.   Mantese at General Motors and Graeme Walter
              Milton at the University of Utah. The   research involves the study of
              electrical and magnetic properties of composite materials.   The mathematics
              includes development and use of numerical methods to compute bounds   on some
              of the complex properties of the materials.
