Abstract    :
              9629072  Richards    The PIs propose to hold an interdisciplinary Chapman
              conference  that brings together 80-100 scientists and students focused on 
              identifying and solving fundamental problems of plate tectonics and  mantle
              dynamics.  Recent advances in geodynamic modeling and  seismic imaging of the
              earth's interior offer new possibilities for  integrating knowledge of the
              history of plate motions with these  new results.  The main purpose of the
              conference is to bring  together the plate reconstruction and mantle dynamics
              communities,  which have until now worked in isolation.  Conference goals 
              include:  1) fostering innovative cross-disciplinary scientific  interchange
              toward better integrating the geological record of  plate motions into
              geodynamic models, 2) improving geodynamic  models by integrating a more mature
              knowledge of the forces acting  on plates, 3) improving our understanding of
              the nature of plate  boundaries, and 4) developing a better understanding of
              the  relationship between deep mantle processes and global plate  motions.
