Abstract    :
              9629791  Shultz  Because they encompass an unparalleled range of structural and
              taxonomic diversity and have an extremely rich and ancient fossil record, the
              arthropods (spiders, crabs, insects and their relatives) offer many
              opportunities for addressing fundamental issues in evolutionary biology.  Any
              meaningful synthesis requires a firm understanding of how the arthropods are
              related to one another; but the phylogenetic relationships among the major
              arthropod lineages are difficult to recover.  Many different and controversial
              reconstructions have been proposed.     In this study, Jeffrey W. Schultz and
              Jerome C. Regier will determine whether analysis of the DNA sequences of two
              slowly-evolving nuclear genes, elongation factor 1a and RNA polymerase II, can
              provide a more robust phylogenetic reconstruction for arthropods.  The
              researchers will obtain and sequence these genes from a large sample of
              arthropods representing all major groups, and will analyze these sequences
              using phylogenetic reconstruction methods.  Studies on other organisms have
              suggested that these genes are appropriate for the analysis of lineages as
              anciently diverged as the arthropod lineages are thought to be.  A more fully
              resolved phylogenetic tree for arthropods will offer a unique and useful
              framework for addressing basic questions about the tempo and mode of
              phylogenetic and structural diversification in arthropods and in other forms of
              life.
