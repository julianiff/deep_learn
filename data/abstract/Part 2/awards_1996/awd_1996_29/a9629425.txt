Abstract    :
              This CAREER award will support laboratory and numerical modeling of  midocean
              ridge hydrothermal circulation.  The research component  will use
              finite-element models of cellular convection to examine  questions of nonsteady
              flow, two- or three-dimensionality, and the  effects of nonlinear phase
              properties.  The teaching component will  be built around a laboratory class in
              which students will develop  various experiments in fluid dynamics.
