Abstract    :
              ***  96-29424  Lin  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 11 project is
              to develop a novel optical self-routing technique for data switching
              applications in an optically interconnected network.  The optical self-routing
              technique is based on   a holographic optical associate memory (HOAM)
              technology.  The global association, high processing speed, and simplicity of
              the HOAM concept offers significant improvements over conventional electronic
              and photonic data switching techniques, in both data rate and in the number of
              available channels in a self-routing switching node.  In Phase I, a complete,
              small-scale optical self-routing interconnected network based on the HOAM
              technique was constructed.  The network successfully demonstrated the unique
              advantages of the HOAM and the proposed self-routing switching node for use in
              optically interconnected networks.  In Phase II, the full-scale
              design/packaging development of the HOAM and its self-routing switching node
              will be completed.  A Phase II testbed will be designed, constructed, and
              demonstrated.  The commercialization effort for the developed technology also
              will be initiated in Phase 11.    Federal and Commercial applications of the
              high-performance self-routing optical interconnect network include C3I
              networks, tactical information exchange systems, distributed
              computer-to-computer networks, multimedia communication, and the National
              Information Infrastructure.  ***
