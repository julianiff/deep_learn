Abstract    :
                  9629376     Richards  The PIs propose an interdisciplinary study to improve
              paleomagnetic estimates of polar  motion and their uncertainties, and to derive
              better models of the effects of geophysical  processes on long-term rotational
              dynamics.  The PIs will combine observational  paleomagnetic data used to
              constrain polar wandering curves, and geodynamic modeling  focused on
              discriminating among alternative geophysical processes that may have affected 
              true polar wander in the past 26 Myr.  ***
