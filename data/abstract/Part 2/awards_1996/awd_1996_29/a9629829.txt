Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is to develop a new approach to basic
              research in conservation biology--Species-Centered Environmental Analysis--and
              to apply it to an extensive study of the population dynamics of the endangered
              red-cockaded woodpecker in relation to its environment.  The USDA Forest
              service has agreed to conduct an experimental 5-year prescribed-burning program
              in the longleaf pine forests of the Apalachicola National Forest in Florida in
              60 management compartments where we will be able to monitor the birds and the
              ground cover vegetation.  In a subset of 24 compartments, we will monitor the
              arthropod fauna of the pine trees and the movement of nutrients through the
              system.  In 12 of the 24 compartments we will conduct a nutrient enrichment
              experiment in which treatments will include supplemental calcium with and
              without supplemental phosphorus and nitrogen.  The major questions being asked
              are (1) Is the movement of nutrients through this ecosystem affected by the
              season and frequency of prescribed fire; and (2) Does this movement affect the
              nutritional quality of arboreal arthropods, the main diet of the woodpeckers.  
               This project is an example of ecosystem management--the experimental
              application of management alternatives that allows the results of basic
              research in population and ecosystem ecology to be used to select among future
              management options.
