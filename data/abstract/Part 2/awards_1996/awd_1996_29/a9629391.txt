Abstract    :
              Abstract  ATM-9629391  Clayson, Carol Anne  Purdue University  Title: Influence
              of Tropical Clouds on Sea Surface Temperature, Sea  Surface Salinity, and the
              Ocean Mixed Layer    The science aims of this "CAREER" proposal are 1)
              improving the  physical representation of solar radiation and precipitation 
              processes in the existing surface flux and ocean mixed layer  models, 2)
              evaluation of the influence of high frequency convective  events and seasonal
              to interannual variability on SST and SSS and  cloud characteristics over the
              warm pool and the entire tropical  ocean.    The educational component consists
              of 1) development of a number of  inter disciplinary courses at under graduate
              levels, 2) enhancement  of learning using computer-assisted instruction, 3)
              completion of  an electronic textbook on small scale processes in air-sea 
              interaction.
