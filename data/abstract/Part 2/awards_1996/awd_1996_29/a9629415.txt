Abstract    :
              9629415  Bridgham    The goal of this research is to understand the important
              factors that structure peatlands in space and time.  Major attributes of
              interest are plant community composition, net primary production, accumulation
              of  carbon in soil organic matter, and trace gas emissions.  It is hypothesized
              that four major environmental gradients (climate, pH/alkalinity, water-table
              height, and limiting nutrients) are the primary factors structuring peatland
              ecosystems.  Previous research has focused upon climate change impacts on
              peatlands and the potential enhancement of trace gas emissions under future
              climatic regimes.  An additional parallel research program will be conducted
              that focuses on the relative roles of nutrients and alkalinity as major factors
              influencing peatlands.  Innovative educational activities will be integrated
              with an active research program to provide students with first-hand experience
              in the theory and practice of ecology.
