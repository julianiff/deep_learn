Abstract    :
              9629515  HERATY   This award will support a world-wide generic level revision
              and phylogenetic analysis of the parasitoid wasp family Eucharitidae (Insecta:
              Hymenoptera) based on morphological features of adults and larvae.   These
              minute wasps parasitize ant pupae and the family exhibits different modes of
              attaining that host association.   Evolutionary hypotheses of host association
              will be tested and mechanisms of host association will be studied intensively
              by a graduate student among members of the genus Orasema with a focus of these
              field studies in the southwestern United States.  Fifty-six genera are included
              in the Eucharitidae with greatest species abundance occurring  in the tropics;
              a key to the genera for the world will be produced.  Field work in Brazil,
              South Africa, and Australia is planned to provide larval material and
              behavioral information for critical taxa.    These wasps are important natural
              population controls for various ant species, including members known to
              parasitize species in the fire ant genus Solenopsis.  This award will provide
              biological information that might be of use in biological control pest
              management strategies.  A key to genera of the world will be produced for this
              important parasitic wasp family; a graduate student will be trained in modern
              methods of systematic research; and our knowledge of this interesting and
              important component of insect biodiversity will be greatly enhanced.
