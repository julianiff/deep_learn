Abstract    :
              9629770  Hendrix  Since 1978, long-term research has been conducted on the
              effects of tillage regimes and the impacts of biotic manipulations on soil
              organic matter (SOM) dynamics and nutrient cycling processes in a subtropical
              agroecosystem. After 15 years of conventional tillage and no tillage
              management, dynamics of water-stable aggregates and aggregate-associated soil
              organic matter have been described and monitored at the Horseshoe Bend
              experimental area at the University of Georgia. The formation and stabilization
              of macroaggregates in no tillage soils represents an important mechanism for
              the protection and maintenance of SOM that may otherwise be lost under
              conventional tillage practices. This mechanism may explain the nearly 18%
              higher soil organic matter content of no tillage soils as compared to
              conventional tillage soils. These differences in SOM are translated to changes
              in soil biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Funding of this LTREB proposal
              will maintain these long-term experiments, and allow several short-term,
              mechanistic field experiments to be conducted. The dynamics of soil organic
              matter and the response by the soil community to these dynamics take place over
              decades. LTREB funding will allow these investigators the appropriate time
              frame to monitor these dynamics.
