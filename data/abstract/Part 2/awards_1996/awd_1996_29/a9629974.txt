Abstract    :
              The biological ancestry of contemporary African Americans lies in slaves
              transported from  Africa. Among the largest, earliest and historically best
              described burial grounds of African  slaves is that at Newton Plantation,
              Barbados. About 100 individuals of African ancestry buried  between 1660 and
              1820 have been excavated here, but originally only the cranial parts were 
              retained for analysis. This project, with the full support of Barbadian people
              and government  through the Barbados Museum and Historical Society, aims to
              recover the postcranial skeletal  elements for the 80 or so relatively complete
              adult individuals. Analysis incorporating modern  techniques can yield better
              information on the gender and age at death of individuals for  demographic
              analyses, and indicate pathologies such as anemia, activity related arthrosis
              of the  joints, disease and nutrition stress, cortical bone maintenance, and
              bony reaction to infectious  diseases (some of which, such as malaria and
              treponematoses, can be specifically diagnosed).  This will add greatly to the
              inadequate historical accounts of slave lives and adaptations.
