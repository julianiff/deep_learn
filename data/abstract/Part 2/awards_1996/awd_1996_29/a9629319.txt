Abstract    :
              9629319  ALLARD  The insectivores in the order Lipotyphla (shrews, moles,
              hedgehogs and their relatives) represent one of the largest orders of living
              mammals.  However, the genealogical (phylogenetic) relationships among these
              insectivores, and between Lipotyphla and other groups of mammals, remain poorly
              understood.  Several different and competing explanations for how these animals
              are related to each other have been suggested.  Insectivores are among the
              first mammals to appear in the fossil record, suggesting that the various
              lineages of insectivores diverged early in the history of the group (and of
              mammals in general).  It is more difficult to reliably reconstruct the
              phylogenetic relationships of ancient groups of organisms than of more recent
              ones.  In this study, Marc C. Allard will use a multidisciplinary approach to
              investigate the problem of robustly reconstructing the phylogeny of Lipotyphla.
               Allard will obtain sequence information from mitochondrial and nuclear genes
              found in representatives of all families of insectivores.  The sequences will
              be compared with each other and with sequences from other mammalian groups, and
              will be used to construct phylogenetic trees.  The gene sequences will be
              analyzed individually and in combination; also, data from published
              morphological and anatomical information will be encoded, included in a single
              data matrix with the gene sequence data, and used in phylogenetic
              reconstructions.  The results should provide fundamental information on the
              early history and present-day relationships of mammals.
