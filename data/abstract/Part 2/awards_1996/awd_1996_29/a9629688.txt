Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemical Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Academic Research and Infrastructure (ARI) Program   will
              assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin   Madison 
              upgrade the existing 11.74 Tesla NMR. This equipment will   enhance research in
              a number of areas including the following: (1)   mechanistic transition metal
              organometallic chemistry  (2)  synthesis and   mechanistic studis of boron
              hydride clusters (3)  folding patterns in   peptides and proteins, and  (4) 
              organosilicon chemistry.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the
              most powerful tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure
              of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize
              specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
                interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research.
              The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers,
              catalysis, and in biology.
