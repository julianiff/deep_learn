Abstract    :
              Otto  9629502   This Phase II Small Business Innovation Research project will
              develop a novel, low-cost process for manufacturing the robust superconducting
              wires required for commercially viable magnet components capable of operating
              at temperatures that are accessible by inexpensive refrigeration technologies. 
              Most of the potentially large-scale commercial applications of high temperature
              superconducting (HTS) wires in magnet components require high sustained current
              densities at temperatures above 50 K in magnetic fields up to 5 T.  The
              proposed process is an innovative combination of the metallic precursor process
              pioneered by the proposer for the economical production of robust HTS wires,
              and film processes that produce the highest demonstrated critical current
              densities above 50 K in fields above 5 T.  The inherent formability of metallic
              precursor alloys presents a unique opportunity for manufacturing complex,
              geometrically precise, chemically homogeneous precursors similar locally to
              those used in film processes.  A readily scaleable metallic precursor wire
              manufacturing process will be developed and demonstrated that will employ
              reaction texturing mechanisms akin to substrate catalyzed reaction texturing
              mechanisms utilized in thin film processes.  The transport property targets
              match the requirements for large scale HTS magnet applications operating above
              50 K.  The key target is a whole wire current density of 10 kA/cm2 at or above
              50 K that is sustained in a 5 T field oriented at any direction relative to the
              wire.   The main products enabled by this wire will be lighter and more
              efficient motor and generator coils, current limiter coils, SMES magnets, and
              efficient electronic circuit inductors all operating above 50 K where they can
              be cooled by inexpensive mechanical refrigeration.
