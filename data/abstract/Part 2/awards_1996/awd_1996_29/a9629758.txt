Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  OPP-96-29758  DUMOND/GRIFFIN    This dissertation improvement grant
              proposal combines archaeology and oral history in an analysis of Cupiit Eskimo
              society on Nunivak Island, Alaska. Due to their isolation, these people were
              long able to maintain their traditional lifestyle. The focus of the study is
              Nash Harbor, a known late historic village with at least 350 years of
              occupation. By integrating the oral testimony of island elders with the results
              of archaeological excavations and known ethnographic accounts, a comprehensive
              view of the lifeways of this unique culture will be revealed. This project will
              provide an enhanced understanding of the intimate relationship between the
              Cupiit people and their environment before the contact period, as well as an
              assessment of the impacts of Euroamerican culture into the late 20th century.
              The program involves local people in research, and contributes to an increased
              scientific and cultural literacy at the community level.    ??
