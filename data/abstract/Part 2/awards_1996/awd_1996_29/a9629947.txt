Abstract    :
               ABSTRACT  OPP-9629947  Stoltman/Partlow      This dissertation grant proposal
              focuses on subsistence specialization during the last 1000 years in the Kodiak
              Archipelago in Alaska. The role of marine resource specialization has been
              debated in the North Pacific region. This archaeological study will involve
              systematic collection and analysis of faunal remains from two prehistoric
              sites. Multiple faunal seasonality indicators will be used to test the
              hypothesis that salmon specialization was a major factor in changing village
              organization. The research will be part of, and will benefit from, a
              larger-scale project on Alutiiq history by the Afognak Native Corporation.
