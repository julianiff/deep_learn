              Diehl    This  research  program involves low energy electron  diffraction 
              (LEED)  and helium atom scattering (HAS) experiments, as well  as  molecular 
              dynamics simulations, of alkali metal atoms  and  rare  gas  atoms  on  metal 
              surfaces. The  goal  is  to  increase  our  understanding of the interactions
              and properties which give  rise  to  the equilibrium structures of atoms at
              surfaces. The approach  is  to  determine the structures, the vibrational
              amplitudes  and  their  temperature  dependence in commensurate  structures 
              using  dynamical  LEED. The effects of defects such as  steps  on  these 
              overlayers  will also be investigated, and new LEED calculational  techniques 
              will  be  developed for these systems.  Additionally,  studies  will  be  made 
              in  order  to  understand  the  role  of  corrugation in the rotational epitaxy
              of incommensurate layers .  %%%  This  research program involves the study of
              the structures which  form when simple atoms such as potassium or xenon are
              adsorbed on  metal surfaces such as silver or copper. Their structures will be 
              determined by using the diffraction of electrons or helium atoms.  When  simple
              atoms are adsorbed on surfaces, the structures which  form  may have the same
              periodicity as the surface on which  they  are  adsorbed,  or  a different
              periodicity.  By  measuring  this  periodicity,  we obtain information on how
              these  atoms  interact  with the surface. Such fundamental interactions of
              adsorbed atoms  are interesting and useful for reasons as diverse as learning
              how  to  build  better  computer chips to inventing an  instrument  to  measure
              surface tension.  ***
