Abstract    :
              9629775  Lynch    There is genetic variation for almost every character in
              almost every species.  A leading species.  Al leading explanation for this
              variation is that there is a high mutation rate to mildly deleterious
              variations, and these variants are slowly lost by natural selection.  The study
              organism is the microcrustacean Daphnia arenata; its short generation time,
              variation in reproductive mode, and ease of handling in the laboratory and the
              field make it easy to study these questions.  These processes are general
              across all organisms, so using a species that is easy to study allows general
              insights into how mutation affects genetic variation. This project will
              estimate the mutation rate for several  life-history and morphological traits. 
              The mean and variance of the mutations' homozygous and dominance effects, and
              their interactions with other genes will also be estimated; these values are
              necessary to understand how selection acts on these mutations.  These
              lab-derived estimates will be compared with field populations to see how
              mutation affects genetic variation, inbreeding depression, and genetic
              correlations among traits.    This project is important for estimating how much
              genetic variation in populations contributes to the potential for response to
              changed conditions, such as new diseases or climate change, and how much is
              simply deleterious and lowers the survival and fertility of individuals. 
              Estimates of the rate and effects of deleterious mutations contribute to
              assessing the vulnerability to extinction in small populations of endangered
              species.
