Abstract    :
              9629959  White    This grant provides $148,179 as three years  partial salary
              support for a technician who will  be responsible for operations, maintenance
              and  oversight of instrumentation in the W.M. Keck  Foundation Laboratory at
              Cornell University.  This  laboratory houses an inductively coupled plasma 
              mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) used for trace element  analysis of geological
              samples, a thermal  ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) used to  determine the
              isotopic composition of radiogenic  elements in geological and biological
              samples and  a clean room for sample preparation.  These  instruments serve the
              analytical needs of this  group's diverse studies including, analyses of the 
              geochemical signatures in island arc magmas and  mid-ocean ridge basalts and
              the use of isotopic  ratios of strontium (Sr) and neodymium (Nd) as  tracers of
              both sediment provenance and weathering  history of the Himalayas and
              biogeochemical  cycling in forested ecosystems.  ***
