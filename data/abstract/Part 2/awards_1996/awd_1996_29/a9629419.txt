Abstract    :
              This research is on a data structure, Pseudo-Symmetric Binary Decision Diagrams 
              (PSBDDs), for completely specified Boolean functions. It is based on Ordered 
              Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs) and symmetric networks.  The structure of an 
              OBDD for a totally symmetric function is used as a model for PSBDDs.  The
              Shannon  expansion is used to generate the vertices of PSBDDs.  There is a join
              operation  which combines two adjacent vertices such that the function is
              represented as a  pseudo-symmetric network instead of a binary tree.  The
              research consists of: a)  developing a PSBDD package with four types of
              symmetry; b) investigating the best  heuristic for variable ordering, and
              ordering sets of symmetric variables; c)  comparing mapping results for large
              functions between PSBDDs and BDDs; d)  developing strategies for efficient
              generation of PSBDDs for incompletely  specified functions; e) developing
              diagrams using Davio I and Davio II  expansions; and f) suggesting new
              architectures for Cellular-Architecture type  FPGAs which are design-automation
              friendly.
