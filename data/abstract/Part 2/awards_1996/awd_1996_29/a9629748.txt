Abstract    :
              We are investigating the forces generating the spatial pattern of infection by
              looking at the plant Phlox paniculata and the powdery mildew.  Diseased plants
              may be clumped because of a spatial pattern of resistance to the disease,
              because of environmental patchiness, or because the limited dispersal ability
              of the pathogen prevents distant plants from getting infected.  We will examine
              this question by constructing and comparing spatial maps of disease resistance,
              environmental conditions, and disease occurrence in an intact Phlox population.
               In addition, we will determine if spatial patterns of disease resistance are
              created because near neighbors are close relatives which share similar
              resistance.  Genetic relatedness will be determined by DNA analysis.  Disease
              resistance will be determined by inoculation tests.  Environmental factors will
              be monitored using computer controlled sensors, and disease occurrence will be
              monitored by weekly censusing.  By understanding the factors controlling
              disease spread in Phlox paniculata, we will better understand how all plant
              diseases spread.
