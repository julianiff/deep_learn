Abstract    :
              9629884  "Workshop on Integrated Research for Civil Infrastructure""  Dr. Rae
              Zimmerman and Dr. Roy Sparrow, Wagner Graduate  School, New York  University   
                The integration of engineering, the sciences (social,  behavioral, economic, 
              physical, natural, and materials science), and mathematics  is important to 
              the conceptualization and implementation of infrastructure  performance  needs,
              which require an interdisciplinary focus.  This  workshop will bring  together
              experts from a variety of academic disciplines as  well as  professional
              settings to address research needs and  opportunities in the  are of integrated
              assessments for infrastructure  performance.  A  multidisciplinary perspective
              will be supported by the use  of three  co-chairpersons from engineering, the
              social, behavioral,  and economic  sciences; and the physical, natural, and
              materials sciences  and  mathematics, who will join the New York 
              University/Polytechnic University  team in planning and carrying out the
              workshop.  It will  build on the  experiences of prior workshops.  The workshop
              will be  designed to promote a  dialogue among the participants to address
              where research is  needed to  promote integrated infrastructure assessment,
              what the  opportunities are,  where the gaps are, and what mechanisms or
              approaches are  appropriate to  address these research issues.  A report will
              be prepared  containing  workshop recommendations on these issues, and wider 
              dissemination of the  results will be considered.  ***
