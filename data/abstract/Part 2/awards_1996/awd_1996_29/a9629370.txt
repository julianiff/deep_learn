Abstract    :
              This CAREER award will support research to develop the use of Nd  isotopes in
              fossil fish teeth and apply this tool as a paleo-  watermass tracer of North
              Atlantic Deep Water and variations in  Mediterranean weathering during the last
              glacial/interglacial  cycle.  Two graduate students will be involved in the
              research.   Educational activities include helping to develop a curriculum in 
              Earth Systems Science which will feature WWW sites with course  notes and lab
              exercises.
