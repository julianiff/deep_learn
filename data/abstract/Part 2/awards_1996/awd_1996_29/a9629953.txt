Abstract    :
              This three-year program will investigate the nature of quasi-periodic (QP) radar
              echoes that occur from sporadic E layers in the nighttime midlatitude
              ionosphere.  There is mounting evidence of the existence of a
              still-unidentified source of unexpectedly strong energetics in the midlatitude
              ionosphere.  It is important the PI strive to identify and understand the
              physics of this phenomenon, because it reflects a lack of fundamental
              understanding of ionospheric plasma processes.  Moreover, the PI will
              participate in a US-Japan rocket program in which rockets and ground-based
              sensors will make in situ measurements of plasma density, electric field, and
              neutral wind in the E region.
