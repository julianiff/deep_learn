Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT  OPP 9629992  Maschner, Hoffman      This dissertation grant is for
              support of an archaeological project on Unimak Island in the Aleutian Islands,
              Alaska. The goal is to illuminate the socio-economic organization of a complex
              hunter-gatherer village. The site consists of some nine semi-subterranean
              houses. Preservation at the site is excellent and this site is ideal for
              archaeological study in this little known region. Ethnohistorical and
              archaeological data suggest that early contact-period Aleut society was
              socially and politically complex. There were numerous ranked societies,
              permanent communal houses, intensive warfare and inter-regional exchange
              networks. The relationships between rank, economic organization, and the
              corporate group will be investigated through the excavation of these
              multi-family houses and analysis of artifacts, features and food refuse.
