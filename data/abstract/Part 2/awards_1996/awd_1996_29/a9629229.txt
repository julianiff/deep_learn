Abstract    :
              9630440  Ryan      The field of endocrinology is a rapidly advancing area of
              biology.   A number of highly significant advances in biology have been 
              derived from investigations into the action of hormones on cellular  and
              organismal function, and the mechanisms used for cellular  communication.  This
              discipline now spans the great diversity of  research interests from
              investigations into the molecular events in  cell nuclei caused by steroid
              hormone interactions with  intracellular receptors to understanding hormonal
              regulation of  behavior.  The International Congress of Endocrinology to be
              held  in San Francisco, CA in June, 1996 represents a mechanism for 
              investigators, young and old, to come together to learn about the  latest
              advances in this rapidly evolving field.  With this award,  the Women in
              Endocrinology will support the travel of 10 young  female investigators to
              attend the International Congress.   Attendance at this Congress will be a
              mechanism for new  investigators to present their data to their peers and to
              discuss  the recent advances in this field.  In addition, it will provide 
              young female investigators with a mechanism to develop  relationships with more
              senior female investigators in  endocrinology, who can help them in the future
              successfully  navigate a career path.  Attendance at this meeting will
              positively  impact the young investigator, as well as the other investigators 
              in attendance.
