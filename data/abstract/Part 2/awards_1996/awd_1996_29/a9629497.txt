Abstract    :
              9629497  Lee   Sequestering of atmospheric CO2 by forest vegetation is a process
              that is important to the biogeochemical carbon cycle.  This exchange process is
              not well understood in a quantitative sense, particularly for nocturnal
              conditions occurring within the planetary boundary layer.  The research focuses
              on the factors that control nocturnal fluxes of CO2 and other scalars between
              the biosphere and atmosphere.   The project will examine atmospheric exchange
              at a process-level by using micrometeorological methods and it is intended to
              advance current techniques that quantify carbon exchange over vegetation
              canopies.  This effort is a modeling study that will analyze currently
              available micrometeorological, boundary layer data for two sites located within
              a boreal forest ecosystem of Ontario, Canada (i.e., BOREAS experiment, summer
              1993). The PI will also analyze micrometeorological data sets that will be
              obtained from two planned ecosystem boundary layer experiments: the Great
              Mountain Forest (GMF), Connecticut (site operational April 1996), and the Farm
              River Salt Marsh, New Haven, Connecticut (project planned 1998, funded by the
              Connecticut Sea Grant Program).  The four experimental sites are selected on
              the basis of canopy profile (e.g., height, morphology, vegetation composition).
                Analyses of the micrometeorological data from these sites are intended to
              improve the present understanding of the dynamic coupling between vegetation
              and atmospheric flow and how this coupling affects larger scale
              forest-atmosphere interactions and boundary-layer turbulence.   ***
