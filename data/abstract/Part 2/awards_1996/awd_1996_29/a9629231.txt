Abstract    :
              Molvray  9629231  Understanding relationships among living things is useful to
              any discipline associated with biology.  Once relationships are known,
              properties of poorly known organisms can be predicted from their better known
              relatives.  Such basic information is used  in forestry, agriculture, and
              medicine.  Relationships among Gastrodieae, specifically, are of interest for
              two reasons.  The first is that relationships in the tribe are very difficult
              to reconstruct, and solving this puzzle will increase our knowledge of good
              methodologies for phylogenetic reconstruction generally.  The second is that
              Gastrodieae occupy a critical position at the base of the orchid family tree. 
              Depending on the correct position of those basal branches, higher branches in
              the tree_including horticulturally important genera_may be realigned, thus
              providing us with a more accurate picture of the evolutionary sequences in this
              important group.
