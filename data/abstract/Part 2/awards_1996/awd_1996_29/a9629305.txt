Abstract    :
              ***  9629305  Schmidt          This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project will demonstrate the  feasibility of two cone penetrometers chemical
              detection systems. These systems have the  potential to reduce the cost of
              remediation site characterization, which is currently  estimated at over $400
              billion in the United States, by 25%. This cost savings will be  achieved by
              using chemical sensor-equipped cone penetrometers in place of the expensive
              soil boring and well monitoring processes currently used to characterize
              remediation sites.  The Phase I effort demonstrated the feasibility of a
              membrane inlet assembly for cone penetrometers. The Phase II effort will
              demonstrate the feasibility of combining the membrane inlet assembly with two
              types of chemical sensors capable of detecting volatile organic hydrocarbons
              (VOCs).  Prototype detection systems will be fabricated, calibrated in the
              laboratory, and then tested using standard cone penetrometer rigs at actual
              contaminated sites.  The performance of the cone penetrometer sensors will be
              correlated with the results of EPA-approved analytical techniques.      Two
              products are expected to result from this research.  The first is a system
              which can measure the concentration of both chlorinated and non-chlorinated
              hydrocarbons in soil in real time.  The second is an adapter which permits one
              to mount a miniature gas chromatograph in a cone penetrometer.  ***
