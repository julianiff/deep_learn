Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project by a student of cultural anthropology from
              Emory University will study how tribal communities in northern Mozambique that
              were displaced during the recent war have reconstructed those aspects of their
              social organization oriented around political authority.  Through a comparative
              analysis of two communities differently affected by the war, one having been
              displaced and then resettled, the other having been relatively unaffected
              during the violent period, the research will test the hypothesis that the
              resettled community will demonstrate more `open-endedness` or will reveal a
              greater range in its political authority.   This research is important because
              it will advance our understanding of the effects of resettlement.  Existing
              theories focus on the conservative tendencies of resettled groups.  The
              hypothesis will be tested through a combination of quantitative and qualitative
              methods, involving a household questionnaire, semi-structured elicitation of
              cultural models, life-history interviews, and an analysis of micro-interaction
              and conflict situations.  In addition to increasing our  understanding about
              the effects of resettlement on traditional communities, knowledge which will be
              important for policy makers, the project adds to the nation's expertise about
              this important area of the world.
