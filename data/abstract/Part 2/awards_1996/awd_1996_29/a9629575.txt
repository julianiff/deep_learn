Abstract    :
              9629575  Wiersma    The Maine Science and Technology Foundation (MSTF) will
              undertake  to: (1) effect positive and permanent changes in methods of 
              supporting research (i.e., facilities, equipment, resource  allocation, etc.)
              and (2) reward faculty for productivity in the  University of Maine System
              within the context of Maine's S&T  Plan.  The University of Maine (UMaine) will
              also undertake to  effect positive and permanent changes in how the institution
               supports research competitiveness.  These include:  increasing  available
              resources from both state allocations and federal  funding; redistributing
              University resources to provide better  support for research; focusing
              resources, either through new  investment or reallocation, to strengthen
              research areas that are  critical to the state and consistent with the goals of
              UMaine;  enhancing personnel and facilities; building public and 
              private-sector support for UMaine; and increasing awareness of  S&T activities
              at UMaine through education and outreach.  The  project also:  (1) focuses
              investments in two S&T areas at UMaine  with state-wide importance and economic
              potential  (fiber-reinforced polymer-wood hybrid and aquaculture); (2) 
              strengthens the partnerships between UMaine, MSTF, NSF, the  business
              community, and the legislature; and (4) identifies  principal barriers to
              research competitiveness at multiple levels  and outlines a multi-pronged
              strategy for overcoming them.
