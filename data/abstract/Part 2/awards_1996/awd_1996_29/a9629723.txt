Abstract    :
              9629723  GOLDBERG  This research will examine the effects of competition among
              plant for limited resources such as light and water at the level of the entire
              community.  While competitive effects on individual plant performance are well
              known, the general effects of competition on diverse and complex communities
              are much more poorly understood.  Using desert annual plant communities as a
              model system, we will conduct a series of garden and field experiments to
              manipulate the density of entire plant communities to determine how competitive
              interactions lead to change in species' abundances and biodiversity.  The
              experiments will mimic a natural rainfall gradient from a desert to a much
              wetter Mediterranean climate so that we can also investigate how the influence
              of competition changes among environments.  Because models of global climatic
              change predict major shifts in precipitation patterns, these data are directly
              relevant to general models of how vegetation will respond to global
              environmental change.
