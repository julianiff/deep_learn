Abstract    :
              9629804  Longley       In this RUI proposal Professor Longley requests support 
              for participation in the Macro Collaboration for himself and  two undergraduate
              students.  This group will analyze events  with upward going neutrinos for the
              study of neutrino  oscillations.  ***
