Abstract    :
               This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              Syracuse University.  The focus of the project is to study linguistic practice
              in a North Indian village within discourses of everyday social interaction, and
              in the context of verbal performances  The speech of different caste members in
              the village as well as more specialized performers will be analyzed to discover
              and report on the logic of linguistic interpersonal negotiation in Hindi. 
              Methods will include participant observation and careful recording of verbal
              interactions and performances. The fundamental question is to understand how
              people select or reveal through their linguistic forms their social position
              with respect to the other member of the conversation.     This research will
              advance our understanding of how language situates a person in a  social field
              of interaction.  By analyzing the discursive tools and frames in which members
              of this culture appreciate artistic forms and reveal differences in status,
              this case study will help advance our general understanding of how people's
              discourse constructs as well as reflects their social reality.
