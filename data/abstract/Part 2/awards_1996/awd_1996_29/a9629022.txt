Abstract    :
              This award funds an initial investigation of design, control, and  planning  
              issues   for  self-reconfigurable  robots.   A   self-  reconfigurable  robot
              is a set of one or more autonomous  modules  with  the  capability to
              self-organize, that is, to change  their  geometric shape autonomously. 
              Self-reconfigurable robots can  be  viewed   as   a  minimalist  approach  to 
              designing   versatile,  extensible,   and   reliable  robots.  They  are  
              suitable   for  applications   that  require  multiple  locomotion   gaits  
              over  different  types  of  terrain,  or  that  combine  mobility  with 
              flexible  manipulation in ways that could not be  anticipated  at  the time of
              initial design of a conventional robot. The focus  of  this work is
              task-directed self-reconfiguration, with an emphasis  on  robots  that can
              self-organize to support multiple locomotion  gaits and on robots that can
              sequence locomotion and manipulation  gaits.   This  research will explore
              several  designs  for  self-  reconfigurable  modules. The potential of  each 
              design  will  be  evaluated  by  geometrically characterizing the class  of 
              three-  dimensional  robotic structures that can be built with  it.  This 
              research  will  also consider control and planning approaches  to 
              self-reconfiguration.   For  each  module  design,  control   and  coordination
              algorithms will be developed and evaluated. A set of  basic  configuration
              structures that consist of the basic  module  designs  and  support specific
              manipulation and locomotion  gaits  will  be developed. Planning algorithms for
              transitioning between  any two such configurations will be developed and
              evaluated.
