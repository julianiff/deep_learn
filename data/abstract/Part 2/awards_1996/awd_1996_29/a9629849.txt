Abstract    :
              9629849   Lively     In a genetically diverse population, parasites may
              preferentially attack the most common genetic type.  Thus, cross fertilization
              in plants and animals may have the benefit of producing offspring with rare
              genotypes, which is called the Red Queen hypothesis.  The objective of this
              project is to test a critical prediction of the Red Queen hypothesis, that host
              clones that were common in the recent past are preferentially attacked by
              parasites, and hence their proportion in the population has been reduced.  The
              long-term dynamics of a natural, clonal population of freshwater snails will be
              studied, and the clone dynamics will be studied, and the clone dynamics will be
              related to host clone-specific rates of infection.      The results will be
              important for understanding susceptibility and resistance to pests and
              pathogens, and how such parasites cause genetic changes in the host population.
