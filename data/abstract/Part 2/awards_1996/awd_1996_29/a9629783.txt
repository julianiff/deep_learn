Abstract    :
                Steroid hormones play key roles in the development of gender differences in
              behavior, part of the process known as sexual differentiation.  In many
              vertebrates, one such hormone-mediated difference is that males often are more
              aggressive than females.  Features that rarely occur in combination, but are
              found in Sceloporus lizards, make them an ideal model for the integrative study
              of variation in hormonal mediation of aggression:  They are a set of closely
              related species that (1) vary reliably in male-female differences in levels of
              aggression; (2) have unambiguous aggressive behaviors; (3) are amenable to
              hormone manipulations both in the laboratory and under free-living conditions,
              and to both perinatal and adult hormone manipulations, and (4) can be reared to
              adulthood in the laboratory and will exhibit the full array of typical adult
              behavior, including aggression.  Dr. Hews will examine the neuroendocrine basis
              of dramatic differences among three Sceloporus species in the morphological
              color traits used in signaling territorial aggression and in the degree to
              which males and females differ in levels of aggression.  This Research Planning
              Grant will enable Dr. Hews to (1) establish levels of aggression in free-living
              males and females of the three study species, using a well-established testing
              paradigm, (2) develop a laboratory paradigm for testing aggression in the three
              species, (3) obtain breeding-season blood samples for radioimmunoassay to
              assess plasma hormone levels (data needed for future experiments in which
              implants manipulate hormone level in a physiological manner), and (4) determine
              the size of a hormone implant needed to deliver a maximum physiological level.
