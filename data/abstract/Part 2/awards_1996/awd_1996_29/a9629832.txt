Abstract    :
               This dissertation research project at the University of Kentucky supports a
              cultural anthropology student studying how residents of rural communities in
              Bulgaria understand and manage biodiversity conservation.  The problem is to
              understand how global concerns about biodiversity conservation are mediated by
              local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and practiced by mountain peasants
              in Bulgaria.  Through studying the effects of variation in gender, age and
              ethnic affiliation, the student will measure levels of resource use and
              management and study the local meaning of concepts such as `nature
              conservation` and `environment`.  The site is an area rich in biodiversity. 
              Study methods include a baseline household survey of two local communities, a
              detailed study of natural resource use and economic activities of 20 households
              in each village, case studies of natural resource disputes and the collection
              of documents, as well as participant observation and formal interviews in local
              villages and in NGOs in the national capitol.    In addition to enhancing our
              knowledge of resource use and conservation activities in post-community
              Bulgaria and providing a local-level analysis of NGOs, this study contributes
              to the broader understanding of the impact of the transition from state
              socialism in Eastern Europe on rural land management practices, conservation
              efforts and civil society.  The project also increases the nation's expertise
              about this important region of the world.
