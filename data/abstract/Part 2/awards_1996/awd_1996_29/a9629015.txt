Abstract    :
                Professor Robert T. Kennedy of the Department of Chemistry at the  University
              of Florida is one of sixty young, independent  researchers to receive the first
              annual Presidential Early Career  Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE).
               There are twenty  PECASE Awardees from the National Science Foundation this
              year.   This highly prestigious award is being given for the first time in 
              recognition of excellence and promise for future success in  scientific and
              engineering research, and the potential for eventual  leadership of the
              awardees in their respective fields.  Kennedy has  worked on the development
              and validation of electrodes that can  measure insulin and melanocyte
              stimulating hormone secretion from  single cells at the level of single
              exocytosis events, studies of  the fundamentals of exocytosis, the development
              of rapid  immunoassays using capillary electrophoresis, and in coupling 
              capillary electrophoresis with microdialysis sampling for  neurotransmitter and
              metabolite monitoring in vivo.  He is also  known for his genuine enthusiasm
              for and outstanding performance as  a classroom and as a laboratory teacher.
