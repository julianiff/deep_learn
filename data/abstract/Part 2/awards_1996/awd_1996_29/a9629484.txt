Abstract    :
              9629484  McNutt       This grant is to provide funds to hold a workshop that
              will  define the fundamental scientific questions in the "mid-plate"  area of
              marine geology and geophysics, where "mid-plate" is the  part of the ocean
              basins between the mid-ocean ridges and the  margins.  This workshop will
              prepare a white paper that will be  used as part of a larger marine geology and
              geophysics planning  effort.  ***
