Abstract    :
              9629460  HARRIS   The factors that affect growth and decline of populations in
              nature remain elusive, in part because the importance of social interactions
              has been underestimated.  Drs. Harris and Knight propose to study joint nesting
              behavior in a salamander species and relate that behavior to changes in
              population size over time.  For example, populations that contain a high
              percentage of joint nesters may be larger in size than populations that contain
              a high percentage of solitary nesters.  In addition, they will investigate
              whether joint nesters are the result of cooperative interactions among
              relatives.  Methods will include experiments in the laboratory, field
              observations, and the use of DNA fingerprinting techniques.   Results may
              indicate that existing predictive models of population growth and decline that
              treat all individuals as identical are inadequate and that the incorporation of
              behavioral variation among individuals into predictive population models may a
              necessity.  Furthermore, data derived from this detailed population study may
              provide insights into the causes of an alarming decline in amphibian
              populations in many areas of the world.  Active participation of undergraduate
              students in all aspects of this research will prepare them for careers in the
              biological sciences.
