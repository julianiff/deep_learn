Abstract    :
              9629366  DIMMICK  Lake Tana supports the largest freshwater fishery resource in
              the East African nation of Ethiopia.  A key element of this fishery is a group
              of African carps (genus Barbus). The adult Barbus carps in Lake Tana can be
              separated into fourteen different morphological types (morphotypes), varying in
              size, shape, habitat within the lake, and feeding preferences.   These
              morphotypes may represent variants of a single species, any of whose members
              may breed with any other, or they may represent up to fourteen distinct
              species, each incapable of breeding with any other form.  Strategies for
              conserving the Lake Tana biota, and for managing its fishery, will differ
              significantly depending on whether the carps belong to one species or many. 
              Also, the Lake Tana Barbus likely will provide scientists with important
              information on how living species change in a particular place over time. 
              Walter Dimmick, with his colleagues and students, will attempt to determine the
              number of Barbus  species present in Lake Tana by comparing several different
              types of molecular data from each of the morphotypes, including sequences from
              several mitochondrial and nuclear genes and variations in regions of short
              repeated DNA sequences ("microsatellites").  Cooperative activities include
              collaborative fieldwork with a team of three scientists from the Russian
              Academy of Sciences in Moscow.  Participation by Native American students in
              the project, and in related teaching and research activities at the University
              of Kansas Natural History Museum, will provide opportunities for  these
              students to assess and pursue careers in systematic biology.
