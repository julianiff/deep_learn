Abstract    :
              9629574  Smedley  The goal of the research is to develop a new class-D power 
              amplifier system based on the One-Cycle Control technique and to  realize
              circuit integration.  The new power amplifier should have  low power loss, low
              EMI, and low distortion, wide bandwidth,  large input and output dynamic range,
              robust performance, and  simple circuitry.       The research proposed here
              serves as preliminary research  and planning activities in line with the goal. 
              In this period,  theoretical and experimental study will be conducted to
              further  improve the ripple rejection capability in the high frequency  range,
              to create low noise high speed differential integrator for  One-Cycle Control
              to minimize the distortion, to find suitable  method for soft switching to
              eliminate EMI and increase the power  level, to investigate simple and
              effective input current shaping  circuit to achieve unity power factor, to
              optimize the circuit  configuration, and to provide engineering design
              information for  realizing integrated circuit chips.  ***
