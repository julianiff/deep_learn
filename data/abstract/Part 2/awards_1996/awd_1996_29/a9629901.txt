Abstract    :
              9629901  Colby  This grant will explore the area of dynamics and rheology in 
              polymer blends.  Recent experiments have shown that miscible  blends  have
              complex rheology. One manifestation of this  is  the    breakdown    of    the 
               empirical   time-temperature  superposition  principle, known to be valid for 
              homopolymer  systems.  Recent  theory suggests that the  themorheological 
              complexity  in  blends is driven at the segmental  level  by  concentration 
              fluctuations, coupled to differences  in  the  glass transition temperatures of
              the components. The goal of  the  experimental  portion of the proposed 
              research  is  to  carefully  measure concentration fluctuations  (using  small 
              angle  neutron scattering), local segmental dynamics  (using  dielectric  
              spectroscopy)  and  terminal  dynamics   (using  forward  recoil  spectroscopy 
              diffusion  measurements   and  linear  viscoelasticity) to systematically test
              the proposed  relation between concentration fluctuations and dynamics  in 
              miscible  blends. The theoretical component of the  proposed  work  will extend
              previous concentration fluctuation  ideas,  which  currently only model
              dynamics at the segmental level,  to  predict terminal dynamics (relaxation of
              entire chains).  Computer simulations will also be used to elucidate the role 
              of different variables in the dynamics of miscible blends.  %%%  Since  polymer
              blends are seeing increased use in  practical  applications,   it   is  
              important  that   a   quantitative  understanding of their rheology be obtained
              so as to  assist  in  their  processing.  The long-term goal is to  develop  a 
              complete   molecular  model  forlthe  rheology  of  miscible  polymer blends.
