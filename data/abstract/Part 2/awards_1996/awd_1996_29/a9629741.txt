              Arkhipova 96-29741  Research Planning Grant      Abstract    This project
              focuses on a Drosophila melanogaster moderately repetitive retrotransposon,
              mdg1, with an exceptionally complex promoter, the activity of which can be
              changed during development of the fly. A novel aspect which has never been
              observed in vitro is its duel specificity for RNA polymerase II/III (pol
              II/III). The generality and the basis of this phenomenon need be investigated
              but preliminary studies are needed to define the two possible origins of pol
              II/III transcripts of the retrotransposon and to detect any variation in
              transcripts during the development of the fly. These results will allow further
              research in one of two alternate directions.  %%%  Participation of mobile DNA
              in the organization and function of eukaryotic genomes remains a subject of
              controversy. However it is beginning to be recognized that many different roles
              might be played in various processes at the cellular, organismic and population
              levels by different transposons. Transposons share the corresponding machinery
              with many host genes and their ability to multiply can lead to multiplication
              of regulatory elements found in the transposons. Therefore, a knowledge of the
              diverse regulatory sequences carried by transposons, such as promoters, could
              result in understanding of transposon involvement into qualitative as well as
              quantitative aspects of regulatory evolution in higher eukaryotic organisms.
