                                                     w:\awards\awards96\num.doc  9629180 
              Marcus    This   experimental   project  will   advance   the   fundamental 
              understanding  of the mesoscopic scale behavior of   matter,  and  particularly
                the  appearance  of   quantum-mechanical   chaotic  behavior.  The 
              experimental  research  entails  fabrication   of  semiconductor
              microstructures, in the form of wires and dots, and  the  measurement  of their
              electronic properties  at  millikelvin  temperatures.  Universal  statistics of
              conductance  fluctuations  are connected to quantum manifestations of chaos.
              The educational  components of the project involve finding successful ways to 
              use  advanced textbooks in the teaching of freshman physics,  and  the 
              integration of undergraduate students in laboratory research.  %%%  The
              research carried out searches for understanding of changes in  the  performance
               of semiconductor microelectronic  devices  that  eventually  will  result from
              making the  devices  ever  smaller.  Smaller  devices  are  desirable  in 
              improving  the  speed   and  complexity of computer chips such as the Pentium
              chip, but it  is  expected further advances in the speed and complexity of
              computer  chips  will  eventually  be limited by  the  onset  of  different 
              physical  rules for electron behavior. The present research  will  contribute 
              to our understanding of this transition in  behavior.  The  work  may  also 
              suggest new device  designs  which  may  be  superior  in  the desirable limit
              of extremely small device  size  and  high  device  density.  The educational 
              components  of  the  project  relate  to novel methods in teaching elementary 
              college  physics  and  in giving undergraduate science students an earlier 
              exposure to laboratory research.  ***
