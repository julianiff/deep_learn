Abstract    :
              9629822  Raymond B. Huey and George W. Gilchrist    Human activities have led to
              an alarming increase in the number of species introduced into new areas. 
              Evolutionary changes in introduced species have received little attention,
              although such changes may influence the persistence and impact of introduced
              species.  The fly Drosophila subobscura provides an opportunity for studying
              evolutionary rates in response to new environments.  This species is broadly
              distributed in Europe.  In the late 70's it was accidentally introduced into
              both North and South America.  It rapidly colonized broad geographic areas with
              very different climates, and is now the most common Drosophila in some areas. 
              This project will investigate how temperature, a key climate factor, influences
              the fitness of flies from climatically distinct populations in Europe, the
              evolutionary "baseline", and from similar ones in North America.  The amount of
              differentiation among the North American populations, relative to the European
              ones, will indicate whether introduced insects may be able to evolve rapidly in
              nature.    This project is important for understanding what limits the
              distribution, spread, and persistence of introduced pests, as well as
              understanding the effects of introduced species on native species and
              ecosystems.
