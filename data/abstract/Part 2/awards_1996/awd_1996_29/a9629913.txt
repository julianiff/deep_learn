Abstract    :
              Daniel Kivelson of the Chemistry Department of the University of   California at
              Los Angeles is supported by a grant from the Theoretical   and Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue his studies of   supercooled liquids and low
              temperature polyamorphism.   He plans a   theoretical and experimental study of
              supercooled liquids, the glass   transition, and a newly identified first order
              phase change (called   glaciation) from a supercooled liquid to a rigid
              amorphous phase.    Kivelson will employ a newly developed thermodynamic
              (nonmolecular)   theory of an avoided critical point, the avoidance being
              associated with   geometric frustration.  The project will involve theoretical
              modeling of   supercooled liquids and experimental investigations of the
              related,   apparently amorphous rigid phases.  Glasses are non-crystalline
              states of matter which have unique materials   properties of significant
              commercial importance.  Glassy states exist in   many chemical systems
              including polymeric materials and biological   systems such as  DNA and RNA. 
              Kivelson's research employs both   theoretical and experimental approaches to
              the study of glassy materials   in an attempt to obtain a molecular level
              understanding of the physical   properties which are unique to this class of
              materials.
