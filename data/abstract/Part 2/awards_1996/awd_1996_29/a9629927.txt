Abstract    :
              This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural anthropology
              student from American University.  The project is to investigate the
              relationship between Islamization and democratization in Indonesia, the largest
              Islamic nation in the world (with a population as large as that of Egypt and
              Iran combined).  Based in a university town in central Java, the student will
              interview Muslim university students in groups whose religious orientation
              ranges from very fundamentalist to less rigidly doctrinaire.  The students will
              be asked about their relation to fundamental elements of liberal democracy such
              as freedom of speech, minority and women's' rights and the role of an
              independent judiciary, and will be asked how they deal with personal issues
              such as individual versus group rights, rights versus duties, and the
              principles of social equality and hierarchy.  Through participant observation
              and in-depth interviews the student will learn how local people think about
              these issues.  At the end of the project a survey questionnaire will be
              administered to samples of 150 students living in each of two student boarding
              houses to get information on a representative range of persons and experiences.
                 This research is important because militant Muslim fundamentalists are
              active in an enormous area of the world, in tense relation to local often
              fledgling democracies.  Advances in our understanding of the nature of Islamic
              discourse about democratic issues and principles is vital to developing
              realistic policies leading to successful relations.  In addition this project
              will add to the nation's expertise about this important area of the world.
