Abstract    :
              9629601  Ashton  The goal of this research is to recensus three large-scale (50
              ha) demographic tree plots in tropical Malaysia and Thailand. The information
              will be used to examine how species diversity and community structure vary
              spatially and temporally in relation to habitat factors. The recensus
              information will be used in conjunction with other studies on demography and
              physiology. The mapping protocol will follow that used in the long-term
              monitoring plots on Barro Colorado Island in Panama. Together this study, along
              with the other large-scale plots in both new world and old world tropical
              forests, will provide the baseline for regional and global analyses of tropical
              forest diversity and dynamics. Data collected under this LTREB funding will be
              made available for a wide range of hypothesis testing, monitoring,
              experimentation, and modeling activities by the investigators, in-country
              collaborators, and all other interested researchers.   This project is well
              established and has considerable host-country support. The data from these
              large plots provide the most detailed information on long-term tropical forest
              dynamics. By combining data from this study with other long-term forest
              studies, it will be possible to assess regional and global trends in tropical
              forest communities.
