Abstract    :
                  This project connects the Iowa Valley Community College District to the
              Internet over a T1 line.  The district consists of two community colleges. 
              Faculty and students at the schools benefit from access to the resources of the
              Internet, including libraries and supercomputers.  In addition, they are able
              to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit
              of research and educational projects.  The award provides partial support of
              the project for two years.
