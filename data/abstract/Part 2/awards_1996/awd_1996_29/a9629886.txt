Abstract    :
              9629886  Chen        The interactions of atmospheric flows with mountains is  an
              important issue in atmospheric sciences.  Orography plays   a role in both
              local weather as well as influencing the larger  scale flow.  The isolation of
              the mountainous Island of Hawaii  provides a natural laboratory for studies of
              the impacts of  orography.  In 1990 a cooperative project among several 
              researchers, the Hawaiian Rainband Project (HaRP), was executed  to study the
              influence of the island on local weather and  fundamental mountain/atmospheric
              flow interactions.        The Principal Investigator will continue his analysis
               of data from the HaRP with a focus on furthering  understanding of the impact
              of local environmental conditions  on the formation of rainbands.  A specific
              emphasis will be  the evolution of downslope flow on the windward side of the 
              island of Hawaii throughout the night for relatively dry and  relatively rainy
              cases.  In addition to downslope flow  evolution over land, the deepening of
              the downslope flow in  the Hilo Bay area, the extension of offshore flow over
              the  ocean before sunrise, and the effects of clouds and rains on  the
              downslope flow evolution will be studied.         Furthermore, the Principal
              Investigator will examine  the meteorological conditions that affect the daily
              amounts  of nocturnal rainfall west of Hilo and the early morning  rainfall
              along the coast.  ***
