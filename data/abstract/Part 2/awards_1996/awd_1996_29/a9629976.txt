Abstract    :
              9629976  Manga    This grant provides $39,960 as one-half support of  the costs
              of acquiring computational equipment for  use in departmental research
              including geophysical  fluid dynamics, high pressure mineral physics and 
              hydrology at the University of Oregon.  Specifically, the equipment will
              include a dual-  processor Silicon Graphics server with 256 Mb of  RAM and a 2
              Gb hard disk, two Indigo2 workstations  each with 64 Mb RAM and 2 Gb hard disks
              and  additional mass storage equipment and peripherals.  Specific research
              topics that will utilize the  capabilities of the computational equipment will 
              include studies of two-phase flow of immiscible  fluids in porous and fractured
              rocks, hydrological  models of snowmelt/discharge relationships at high 
              elevation, models of mantle convection, modeling  the thermophysical properties
              of geological  materials in laser-heated diamond anvil cells and  rheological
              models of gas bubbles in magma  chambers and erupted lavas.  ***
