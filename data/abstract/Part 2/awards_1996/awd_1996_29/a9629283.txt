Abstract    :
              9629283  Billard    ABSTRACT    Support is provided for three Pathways to the
              Future workshops to be held in conjunction with the annual Joint Statistical
              Meetings in Anaheim in 1997, Dallas in 1998 and Baltimore in 1999.  Since 1988
              these workshops have assisted young women researchers in Statistics and
              Probability, providing a forum and a mentoring experience.  A committee of
              alumnae and other senior researchers will assist in locating and contacting
              potential award recipients, with the goal being that every young woman
              researcher who wishes to participate should have the opportunity to do so.
