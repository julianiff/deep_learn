Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS- 9629650  H. Arastoopour and B. Bernstein, Illinois Institute of
              Technology    A combined experimental and computational study is undertaken to
              understand the basic mechanisms in the pulverization process of polymeric
              materials by extrusion. The materials are conveyed to an extruder where they
              are heated to form a continuous film of polymeric materials, followed by
              cooling and exposure in solid state to high shear and compressive forces, and
              by rapid relaxation of the induced stresses.  This results in pulverization. 
              The materials may be thermoplastics, thermosetting and elastomers.   The
              experiments will use disk-shaped samples to model the stress state and its
              evolution before pulverization and eventual agglomeration.   Finite element
              method will be applied to simulate the deformations, including boundary slip,
              material fracture, friction, sintering, and agglomeration.      This is a GOALI
              (Grant Opportunity for Academic Interaction with Industry) project in
              collaboration with Amoco and W.R. Grace Co.  The industrial partners will
              participate and provide feedback to the research work.    It is expected that
              the study will lead to a modeling framework, including the controlling
              parameters of the pulverization process, and criteria of pulverization,
              agglomeration, and scale-up.  The pulverization process has relevance to
              manufacturing processes, polymer recycling, textile industry, and pipe coating.
