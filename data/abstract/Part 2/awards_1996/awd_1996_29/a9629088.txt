Abstract    :
              Dr. Alan Cowley, Department of Chemistry, University of Texas at Austin,   is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program   of the
              Chemistry Division for studies of main group rings, clusters, and   assemblies.
              Several new unsaturated ring systems featuring the group 13   elements will be
              prepared, some with potential as candidates for ring   opening metathesis
              polymerization (ROMP).  Heteronorbornadienes will be   investigated for their
              potential as thermal or photochemical sources of,   for example, intermetallic
              materials.  Assembly of bicyclic ring systems   that incorporate group 13 -
              group 13 bonds  into stacked architectures   will be investigated for their
              potentially interesting electrical and/or   magnetic properties.  Various
              approaches to anion recognition, including   multidentate Lewis acid assemblies
              that incorporate group 13 or 14   elements, will also be pursued, and new
              approaches to the formation of   cluster and cage-type compounds of the heavier
              group 13 elements will be   developed.  New combinations of main group elements
              (boron, aluminum, gallium, and   indium) with carbon ring systems and with one
              another, will be prepared   and investigated.  Apart from the intrinsic
              interest in the structures   and bonding descriptions of these rings, these
              compounds have potential   as precursors to new polymeric and intermetallic
              materials with novel   electrical and/or magnetic properties.  The larger ring
              systems are   appropriate for the selective and reversible binding of anions,
              and thus   have potential applications in anion transport and homogeneous
              catalysis
