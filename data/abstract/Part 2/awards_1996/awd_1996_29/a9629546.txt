Abstract    :
              9629546  SPICER   This award will support Dr. Greg Spicer's contribution to a
              research project being done in collaboration with Dr. David Grimaldi.  Grimaldi
              will utilize morphological, ecological, and behavioral information for a group
              of flies, the Drosophila quinaria species group (Insecta: Diptera:
              Drosophilidae), to derive a phylogeny of relationships among the species.  He
              will also pursue a biogeographic analysis of the group which is largely
              Holarctic in distribution but does include a single described species of
              unknown affiliation from China that may represent the tip of an iceberg of
              undescribed species from that region.  Grimaldi's results will be integrated
              with those of Spicer who will pursue a molecular phylogenetic analysis of these
              same species based on mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase) and nuclear (Adh)
              sequences.  At present, the group is of a manageable size, with 28 described
              species that show interesting biological diversity in habitat and breeding
              sites.  It is hoped that the combined morphological and molecular evidence will
              result in a fully resolved phylogeny that, in the future, can be used to
              address several interesting evolutionary questions, including determinants of
              Drosophila host range in parasitic nematodes and phylogenetic constraints on
              shifting to a new ecological niche such as mushroom breeding with possible
              concomitant shifts in tolerance of mushroom toxins.   This award will
              contribute to our understanding of an element of insect biodiversity and begin
              to provide information concerning how species change habit and host
              associations through time.
