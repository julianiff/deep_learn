Abstract    :
                9629805  Mohan  Power Quality has lately become a major concern to the
              electric  utility industry due to increasing number of nonlinear loads, 
              simultaneously with loads which are sensitive to voltage waveform  distortions,
              sags and swells, and the electro-magnetic  interference (EMI).  There are
              numerous examples of momentary  voltage dips resulting in tripping of motor
              drives, nonlinear  loads causing lamp flicker, and so on.  Many of these
              problems  can be eliminated by fast acting static var compensators and  active
              filters.  But their cost and a lack of adequate  performance have limited their
              application.  The objective of the proposed research is to develop a novel all-
               active hybrid converter arrangement for solving Power Quality  problems,
              initially for medium distribution voltages such as 4.16  kV and 7.2 kV, which
              excels in the areas of efficiency, cost,  performance and EMI (Electro-Magnetic
              Interference), without  sacrificing reliability.  ***
