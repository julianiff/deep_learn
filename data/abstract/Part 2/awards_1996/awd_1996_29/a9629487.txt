Abstract    :
              9629487  BURRESON  The phylum Haplosporidia (three genera, about 31 species)
              consists of spore-forming parasitic protozoa, found in a wide variety of marine
              and freshwater invertebrate animals.  Some species cause serious disease in
              commercially important shellfish, including oysters along the east coast of the
              United States.  Accurate knowledge of the biology of Haplosporidia, starting
              with reliable identification and classification of the species, is essential
              for disease prevention and control.  Classification depends on basic knowledge
              of how haplosporidian species are related to one another, and how the phylum
              Haplosporidia is related to other protists.  This knowledge currently is
              inadequate.   In this study, Eugene Burreson, Mark Siddall and Kimberly Reece
              will examine the morphological and molecular characteristics of several species
              of Haplosporidia, including the type species of each genus, and use this
              information to infer the phylogenetic relationships among haplosporidian
              species, and between Haplosporidia and other protist groups.  They will conduct
              detailed observations on morphological features, especially the spores, with
              the light and electron microscopes, and will sequence small-subunit ribosomal
              RNA and actin genes.  The phylogenetic reconstructions, and the classification
              schemes resulting from them, will inform pathogen control strategies by
              permitting more accurate identification of pathogens and, possibly, discovering
              novel aspects of haplosporidian biology (for example, different spore
              morphologies may represent stages in the life history of one haplosporidian
              species, rather than two different species).
