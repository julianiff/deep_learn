Abstract    :
              9629532 Nash Over the four-year duration of this project, the Arizona State
              University lichen collection will be substantially rehoused in new space and
              cabinetry, 17,000 new and 7,000 backlogged collections will be incorporated,
              and a gift of 5,000 specimens will be accessioned.  The project plan also
              allows for growth by 12,000-16,000 specimens over the lifetime of the project,
              and for modest growth thereafter.  All of the specimens will be well-identified
              by the  new associate curator, who will be hired on this award. NSF and Arizona
              State University are partners on this project: each is providing half of the
              salary of the associate curator during the award period (ASU will assume 100%
              of the salary when the grant expires), and ASU is also purchasing equipment and
              providing renovation to allow for the expansion of the lichen collection. With
              these improvements, the ASU lichen herbarium will be a major scientific
              resource on Sonoran Desert lichens, and an excellent reference collection for
              lichens of other parts of the world.  It will support a major ongoing research
              effort on Sonoran Desert lichens, which are important as bioindicators of
              environmental change.
