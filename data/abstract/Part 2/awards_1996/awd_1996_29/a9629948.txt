Abstract    :
              Data speculation refers to the execution of instructions  before it has been
              determined that the data being used is  valid. Data speculation depends on
              dynamic memory  disambiguation to determine if the data was valid, and  forces
              recovery code to execute if the data was invalid.  A  data speculation compiler
              generates recovery code to handle  the situation where such execution violates
              a memory  dependence. This project examines data speculation  techniques, and
              attempts to understand how to utilize them  more effectively. The issues
              addressed are (1) using data  speculation with predication, (2) improving the
              scheduling  algorithms used with it, and (3) using static analysis to  help
              determine when it should be applied.  This work will be  done using the Memory
              Conflict Buffer (MCB) technique for  dynamic disambiguation. The concepts will
              be developed so  they are applicable to other forms of dynamic memory 
              disambiguation.  ***
