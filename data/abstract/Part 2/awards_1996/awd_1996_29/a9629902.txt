Abstract    :
              Abstract - Schmidt - 962992    Partial oxidation of alkanes to produce chemicals
              in single step monolith reactors at very short contact times promises to open
              new routes to chemical synthesis.  The PI plans a systematic examination of
              these processes in an effort to produce oxygen-containing organic molecules by
              direct oxidation of small alkanes to form products such as aldehydes, ketones,
              alcohols, and acids.  This will involve oxide catalysts on low area monolith
              supports in high temperature reactor configurations with rapid ignition,
              complete reaction, and rapid quenching to minimize unwanted homogeneous
              reactions and decomposition of intermediates.    Two projects will involve (1)
              the use of oxide catalysts in short contact time, high temperature partial
              oxidation reactions for times less than 20 milliseconds and temperatures above
              6000C and (2) microsecond reactors in which rapid heating and rapid quenching
              are exploited to optimize heterogeneous-homogeneous partial oxidation processes
              in times much less than one millisecond.  Particular topics to be explored are
              (1) use of higher alkanes, other oxidants, and ammoxidation, (2) use of
              stratified monoliths with reactant injection and interstage cooling or heating,
              (3) exploitation of very high and sonic flow effects, and (4) further
              investigation of fluidized bed reactors.    The PI will search for new catalyst
              systems and reactor geometries which can be operated in a stable state under
              these conditions and thus produce nonequilibrium selectivities to particular
              products at high conversions.  The mechanisms and optimization of these
              processes will also be explored through extensive simulations of reactions,
              mass transfer, heat transfer, and fluid flow effects.
