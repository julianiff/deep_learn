Abstract    :
              9629842 Pregitzer  Cycling of NO3-N in Northern Hardwood Forests: Regulation and
              Consequences of N Saturation     A series of experiments will be conducted in
              Michigan sugar maple forests to determine the potential consequences of chronic
              atmospheric nitrate (NO3-) deposition.  The experiments will utilize a tracer,
              the stable isotope 15N, to do studies to determine the immediate and long-term
              fates of added NO3-. The experiments will monitor processes important to forest
              health and productivity on study plots that receive four times the amount of
              normal atmospheric NO3--N inputs.  The researchers will follow internal
              ecosystem cycling of the added NO3-, enabling the assessment of the
              susceptibility of Michigan sugar maple forests to N saturation from atmospheric
              nitrogen inputs. It is hypothesized that long-term NO3- additions will
              gradually increase N availability, altering above- and below-ground forest
              productivity.  When the forest's capacity to assimilate added NO3- is finally
              exceeded, N saturation should occur, resulting in large leaching losses of NO3-
              and other nutrients such as calcium and magnesium, potentially leading to
              nutrient imbalances and decreased productivity.  This Michigan sugar maple
              forest study will test these hypotheses and provide a more fundamental
              understanding of the internal mechanisms through which ecosystems regulate N
              saturation.
