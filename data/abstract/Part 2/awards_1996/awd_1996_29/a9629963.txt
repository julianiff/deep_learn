Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9629963    This is an exploration of  a  novel concept of catalyst
              design intended to improve selectivity in bifunctional catalysts.  The proposed
              catalysts contain two types of active sites:  one type that is in contact with
              all molecules in the fluid (gas or liquid) medium, and another type, typically
              metal clusters, effectively inaccessible to most reactants but reachable by
              small molecules such as hydrogen.  This situation should minimize undesired
              reactions such as metal-catalyzed carbon-carbon bond fission.  The restricted
              accessibility of the metal clusters is achieved by depositing them in a zeolite
              with one-dimensional micropores that are filled with a physisorbed vapor; it is
              desired to obtain steady-state conditions characteristic of single-file
              diffusion.  The physisorbed molecules may be converted to carbonaceous
              materials which would more thoroughly isolate the metal clusters from large
              molecules while leaving largely unchanged their ability to dissociate hydrogen.
               The hydrogen atoms can then migrate over the zeolite surface to the more
              accessible site ("spillover").    This approach if successful would have
              application to many existing and potential industrial processes, including
              production of aldehydes from carboxylic acids, ethers from esters, and nitroso
              compounds from nitro compounds.  It could also have utility for
              enantioselective hydrogenation or hydroformylation.  These processes are of
              great economic importance to the chemical, drug, cosmetic, and  agrochemical
              industries.
