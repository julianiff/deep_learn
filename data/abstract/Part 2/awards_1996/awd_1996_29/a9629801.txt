Abstract    :
              Modern higher-order languages such as Scheme and Standard ML  provide simple but
              powerful tools for controlling complexity  through abstraction. For twenty
              years, a major goal for  research on these languages has been the development
              of  implementation techniques that bring their performance  closer to that of
              lower level languages. This project will  study techniques for optimizing the
              use of memory in higher-  order programming languages, using a combination of 
              theoretical and experimental techniques. Specific activities  include: (1)
              Development of theoretical methods for proving  the correctness of storage
              optimizations in compilers. (2)  Proof of correctness of several variations of
              aggregate  update analysis and their associated transformations. (3)  Analysis
              and experimental investigation of new algorithms  for generational garbage
              collection.  ***
