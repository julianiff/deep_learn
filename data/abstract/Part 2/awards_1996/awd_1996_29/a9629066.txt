Abstract    :
              9629066  Delfyett  Research activities are being undertaken in the area of
              ultra-high speed photonics.  Potential applications include networking and
              communications, advanced instrumentation and signal processing.  The research
              undertaken contains three major components: 1. semiconductor laser device
              development of a high repetition rate mode-locked semiconductor laser; 2. the
              development of a new optical amplifying media from Cr4+ :LiAI02 and V3+ :LiGaO2
               provide gain at communications-relevant wavelengths and; 3. applications of
              the forementioned components in an ultrafast hybrid WDM-TDM slotted ring all
              optical network.  Students will be trained in the technically vital areas of
              optics, communications and signal processing.  Fundamental processing,
              packaging and manufacturing skills will be obtained by participating
              undergraduate and graduate students.  ***
