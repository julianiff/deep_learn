Abstract    :
              Aponte  9629662     This research is aimed at characterization of selected
              species of the broadly distributed, species rich and pharmaceutically important
              red algal genus Laurencia.  This study also is aimed at elucidation of
              phylogenetic relationships among species of Laurencia by molecular analyses and
              assessment of the distribution of Laurencia species by comparing molecular data
              obtained from specimens assigned to the same taxa from various geographical
              regions.  Species characterizations will focus on Caribbean species and on
              species with cosmopolitan or pantropical distributions.  The study will also
              address the phylogenetic relationships between members of the genus Laurencia,
              its closely related genus Osmundea and their mutual parasite Janczewsia. 
              Laurencia and Osmundea are ecologically important genera that include numerous
              species whose identification is extremely difficult due to morphological
              plasticity.     The proposed study will provide insight to the relevance of the
              morphological characters used to distinguish species in this group of algae as
              well as help to clarify the validity of morphological/reproductive characters
              used to segregate genera and subgenera among Laurencieae.  Inclusion of
              Janczewsia as a common parasite of both genera will provide possible insights
              into the evolution of algal parasite-host relationships, and will be assessed
              by a combined approach of comparative morphology and molecular studies. 
              Molecular characterizations of species and phylogenetic relationships at the
              level of genus, subgenus and species will be inferred from the analysis of
              nucleotide sequences from specific portions of the genome, i.e. nuclear and
              chloroplast genes.  Molecular data will be analyzed by parsimony methods and
              phylogenetic trees will be generated.
