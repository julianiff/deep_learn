Abstract    :
              This starter grant award to the University of California at Irvine   supports
              the research of Professor Patrick J. Farmer.  The theme of the   research is
              the synthesis and study of oriented bimetallic complexes to   illucidate the
              mechanism of long distance electron transfer.  In systems   of bimetallic
              complexes of nickel, copper, and cobalt featuring   tetra-amine ligands, the
              relative angle between two equivalent metal   sites can be changed and the
              rates of electron exchange between sites in   mixed-valence oxidation states
              measured, allowing the contributions of   connectivity, orientation, and
              distance to intersite communication to be   compared.  The research will
              advance the fundamental understanding of the mode of   transmission of
              electrons over relatively long distances.  The use of   tetra-amine ligands in
              the formation of metal-based linear polymers could   lead to materials with
              unusual optical and magnetic properties.
