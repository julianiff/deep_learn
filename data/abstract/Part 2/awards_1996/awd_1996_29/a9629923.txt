                                        ABSTRACT                                  PI:  Zucker 
                Neural Basis of Circadian Rhythms    Orientation in time is a critical
              adaptation of all animals.  Daily activity cycles and seasonal rhythms both
              rely heavily  on endogenous circadian rhythms apparently generated in some 
              vertebrates by highly localized brain "clocks."  In mammals  and birds the
              suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the  hypothalamus has been considered the
              dominant or "master"  circadian clock. When in the course of vertebrate
              evolution  the SCN assumed its timekeeping function is not known. Dr.  Zucker
              is determining if the SCN is essential for the  generation of circadian rhythms
              in swimming behavior and  physiology and whether the retino-hypothalamic
              pathway that  terminates in the SCN mediates entrainment of circadian  rhythms.
               This highly innovative and risky investigation  will provide the first
              information on brain mechanisms  responsible for generation of non-mammalian
              circadian  rhythms and will be useful in theorizing about the evolution  of
              neural control of rhythmicity in vertebrates.
