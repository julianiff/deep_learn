Abstract    :
              This project addresses problems in the areas of object-  oriented programming
              languages and software security. The  goals are to simplify the structure and
              process of producing  software systems and increase their resistance to certain
               forms of insecurity. The techniques are both analytical,  drawing on ideas
              from type theory and mathematical logic,  and experimental, involving the
              implementation of language  designs and experimental development of prototype
              systems.  One main focus of the work is the design and implementation  of an
              extension of Standard ML with object-oriented  features. Similar language ideas
              are also considered for C++  or Java variants or design or debugging tools. An 
              experimental evaluation of either language may involve  design or redesign of
              existing software in order to improve  its security properties. This might
              involve network servers  such as ftp or http, or an interpreter for a network 
              scripting language. Both the science of software production  and  software
              security are considered important areas, with  increasing concern for security
              likely to lead to increasing  interest in relevant software analysis methods.
