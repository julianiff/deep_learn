Abstract    :
              Masters  9629271   The PIs propose to construct a seismological earth model
              consistent with a large body of recent seismic data spanning several orders of
              magnitude in frequency.  The project includes two workshops with
              interdisciplinary participation of mineral physicists, geodynamicists and
              seismologists to develop the modeling strategy and agree upon inclusion of data
              sets, and at the end of the project to evaluate the performance of the model.
