Abstract    :
              9629868  Kollman  Characterization of  biological systems has reached an
              unparalleled level of detail.  To organize this detail and arrive at a better
              fundamental understanding of life processes, it is imperative that powerful
              conceptual tools from mathematics and the physical sciences be applied to the
              frontier problems in biology.  Modeling of biological systems is evolving into
              an important partner of experimental work.  All facets of biology,
              environmental, organismic, cellular and molecular biology are becoming more
              accessible to chemical, physical and mathematical approaches.  This area of
              opportunity was highlighted in  the report of a conference supported by the
              National Science Foundation held in 1990 entitled "Mathematics and Biology, the
              Interface, Challenges and Opportunities." (MBICO)  This grant will support a
              workshop that will build on the findings of MBICO in order to critically
              evaluate its findings and to suggest which areas in these critical
              interdisciplinary areas should be the focus of further research.  This workshop
              will bring together approximately thirty scientists, with expertise ranging
              from the molecular to the cellular to the organism to the population biology
              level, all of whom have an interest in applications of
              mathematical/computational approaches to biological systems.  The goal of the
              workshop is to identify the important research areas where
              theoretical/computational studies can be of most use in giving insight and in
              aiding related experimental work.    ***
