Abstract    :
              9629556  Cerling    This grant provides $270,000 as partial support  of the
              costs of acquiring a Nobel gas mass  spectrometer equipped with ion counting 
              electronics, associated extraction and clean up  lines at the University of
              Utah. This instrument  would allow these PI's to conduct in-house  research on
              a wide variety of topics using noble  gas isotopic systematics as a tool. 
              Specific  research projects uould include using the 3H/3He  technique for
              dating groundwater and tracing  groundwater flow paths, dating of geomorphic 
              surface exposures using cosmogenically produced  radionuclides such as 3He, and
              21Ne for  establishing the timing of glacial retreat in  volcanic terrains,
              timing of cataclysmic floods,  determining fault recurrence intervals, and 
              reconstructing continental paleotemperature  records using noble gas
              measurements in aquifers.  ***
