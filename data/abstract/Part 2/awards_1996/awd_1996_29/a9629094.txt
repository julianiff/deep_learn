Abstract    :
              van Keken  9629094  The PIs propose an interdisciplinary study of the evolution
              of noble gases in the Earth's mantle and its implications for the present-day
              volatile distribution in the earth.  The study will involve the development of
              a numerical model of rheology-controlled mantle dynamics that incorporates
              constraints from noble gas geochemistry.  Radiogenic ingrowth and mixing will
              be imposed to simulate the present day observed noble gas distribution in
              mantle material.
