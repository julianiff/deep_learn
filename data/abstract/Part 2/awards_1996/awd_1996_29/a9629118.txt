Abstract    :
              A monthly series of interactive satellite teleconferences is  delivered to
              faculty who teach undergraduate engineering students.  Each telecast features
              an innovative "best practice" which can be  adopted/adapted by participants.
              The 1996 DUE National Engineering  Faculty Forum builds on a successful first
              year of eight  teleconferences which focused on undergraduate engineering 
              education. A total of 1299 colleges and universities and 8,932  individuals
              participated in the first six of the 1995 series, the  average number of
              institutions was 157 with a reported average  attendance of 1,489 per seminar. 
                  The use of the WWW and Internet to support the Faculty Forum Series  has
              grown significantly. The Web server now contains advance  information
              describing upcoming seminars as well as retrospective  data to enable faculty
              to order videotapes of prior seminars.  Presenters solicit input via e-mail
              prior to broadcast and  encourage electronic dialog after their presentation.
              In 1996, NTU  is building on this broad acceptance to provide for electronic 
              registration. FAX transmission and on-line evaluation. The campaign  to
              encourage attendance by instructors at transfer institutions and  community
              colleges is increasing.    NTU works with the NSF/DUE Program Directors to
              identify topics and  presenters.  NTU is producing, marketing, delivering and
              evaluating  seven one-hour, interactive teleconferences in 1996, which are 
              provided to faculty participants without charge. A license to copy  and reuse
              videotapes of the Teleconferences as well as the printed  material provided to
              each registered college/university is integral  to this cost-effective project.
