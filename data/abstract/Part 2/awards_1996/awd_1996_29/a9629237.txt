Abstract    :
              Abstract  ATM-9629237  Zhang, Yuanchong  Columbia University   Title: Impact of
              Tropical Ocean Surface Fluxes on the Atmosphere  and Upper Ocean: Extensions
              from TOGA COARE    This is a three project to investigate the heat and water
              vapor  budgets in the TOGA COARE region in a novel manner by utilizing  surface
              and remotely sensed satellite measurements and  sophisticated one dimensional
              air sea interaction model and  atmospheric radiative transfer model.  The
              maintenance of the warm  pool is the central problem of TOGA COARE and the heat
              and water  budgets are critical to understand this.  Therefore this work is 
              highly relevant to TOGA COARE and climate issues.    The specific goals to be
              achieved are: 1) Determine cloud  characteristics and radiation fluxes by
              examining aircraft and  atmospheric soundings, 2) Extend satellite flux
              analysis to the  entire Pacific Ocean and 3) Complete gridded surface flux
              analysis  for TOGA COARE IOP.
