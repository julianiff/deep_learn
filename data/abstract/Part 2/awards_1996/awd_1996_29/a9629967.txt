Abstract    :
              9629967  Domijan  The objective of the proposed "NSF Conference on Unbundled
              Power  Quality Services in the Power Industry," is to provide an open  forum
              for faculty, students, researchers, utility executives,  managers and
              practicing engineers, regulators and business  professionals to discuss the
              alternatives of providing unbundled  power quality services to customers.  This
              forum will include a  comparison of cost to benefit of alternative plans and
              also, to  review the basic state of technology and engineering in this  area. 
              It is planned that this will be a recurring annual meeting  rotated between the
              University of Florida and the Arizona State  University.  The first conference
              is tentatively scheduled on  November 10-12, 1996.  The methods to be employed
              in development of the NSF conference  will be the creation of a workshop
              atmosphere that will be used  to identify the main research areas in unbundled
              power quality  services, such as: industrial needs, technology, measurement and
               billing, competition, and standards.  The topics to be discussed in the
              proposed conference are  significant to the electric utility industry, which is
              currently  undergoing revolutionary changes in the way it is structured and 
              the services it provides.  Unbundled power quality services are  at the heart
              of these changes to the power industry.  ***
