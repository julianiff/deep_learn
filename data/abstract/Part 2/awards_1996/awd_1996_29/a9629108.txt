Abstract    :
              The project is oriented to demonstrate the use of a lexical-based  parametric  
              framework   to  accommodate   automatic   dictionary  construction  and  to 
              support a broad range of  cross-linguistic  phenomena.   This effort not only
              provides a viable  solution  to  resolving  cross-linguistic distinctions  in 
              the  context  of  a  large-scale MT effort, capturing spatial, temporal, and
              aspectual  knowledge, but also reduces the time for the development of large 
              scale  machine translation (MT) systems.  The first task consists  of 
              determining  the  procedures  for  the  automatic  dictionary  support for MT,
              with demonstration of its use to languages  other  than  English such as Arabic
              and Korean.  A second task  consists  of  the  extension of an existing MT
              model to include  a  broader  range  of  different linguistic phenomena through
              an  interlingua  which   accommodates  the  compositional  derivation  of 
              spatial  relations.    A   final   task  is  the  extension   of   current 
              lexical-semantic representation to include temporal and aspectual  knowledge.
