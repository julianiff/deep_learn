Abstract    :
              9629236  Hastings  This project will use models to understand the dynamics of
              hybrid zones, locations where two species interbreed.  The models improve on
              previous ones by including more realistic descriptions of movement (for
              example, the distribution of seeds around a plant) and of which individuals are
              likely to survive (including survival that depends on the frequency of other
              individuals).  The methods include computer simulations and recent mathematical
              advances in understanding complex equations.  The models will be used to
              estimate the amounts of selection and dispersal in natural hybrid zones. 
              Hybrid zones are important because they are natural laboratories where the
              processes of natural selection are easier to study, since the interbreeding
              among different types produces novel types. Understanding natural selection in
              this way has societal importance for many issues, ranging from the preservation
              of biodiversity to plant and animal breeding.
