Abstract    :
              ***  9629778  Olsen    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              will design, optimize, and deliver a high-performance avalanche photodiode
              (APD) for use in the 1.0-2.2 um spectral region as a high performance
              telecommunications and LIDAR receiver. Strained epitaxial layers will be
              combined with multi-quantum-well (MQW) InGaAsP/InP layers.  The strained layer
              distorts the valence band of the multiplying (gain) region to reduce the field
              at which ionization occurs.  This reduces device operating voltage and also
              decreases the ratio of hole/electron ionization coefficients (compared to the
              unstrained case), and thus decreases noise.  In Phase I devices were fabricated
              and tested with tensile and compressive strain.  Feasibility of concept was
              conclusively demonstrated with measured avalanche gains > 100 and hole/electron
              gain ratios of 0.2-0.4.  Phase II will fabricate and optimize a reliable planar
              structure for light response out to 1.65 um which realizes the advantages of
              low voltage (10-20v), low noise operation, high gain (>50) and high yield.
              These concepts will then be applied to the InAsP/InGaAs materials system, along
              with the use of ternary InAsP substrates, to achieve low-noise avalanche gain
              at 2.2um.    The project will result in a high performance, low cost, infrared
              detector for fiber optic communications, eye-safe range-finding and
              spectroscopy.  This device would also be viable for wavelengths beyond 2 um
              which would open up other commercial possibilities such as gas sensing and
              windshear detection.  APDs are not yet widely used in commercial
              long-wavelength fiber optic communication systems because of their high-noise
              properties.  Successful completion of a Phase II program would enable
              commercialization of a low-noise device which would open up a market, presently
              estimated at over $50 million per year.  ***
