                                        ABSTRACT    PI:  Basolo  Proposal number:  9629318    
                A Comparative Study of a Preference in Live-bearing Fishes     Research
              Component:  This project will investigate the  historical basis of a preference
              for a male trait and  examine changes in the preference over time.  Preferences
               can appear prior to male traits, and can affect male traits  when they arise. 
              Although there is mounting evidence that  such a mechanism for selection can be
              important, little is  known about the history of such preferences and  how they
               might change.  Males in many fish species in the genus  Xiphophorus  possess
              an elongated portion of the caudal fin,  the sword.  Females in this genus, as
              well as in the sister  genus which lacks a sword, have a preference for swords.
               These results, combined with historical evidence, suggest  that this
              preference appeared prior to the appearance of a  sword.  The proposed research
              will test whether the strength  of the preference favoring a sword has changed
              in the  history of this group of fishes and their relatives.    Education
              Component:  The use of both established and  innovative teaching methods are
              proposed as a means to  broaden and improve student learning.  To enhance
              learning  in an Animal Behavior lecture course, cooperative learning  groups,
              an electronic news group, a course world-wide web  site, and email interchanges
              with scientists at other  universities are proposed.  To increase the students 
              appreciation for and understanding of animal behavior, a  laboratory-based
              course, Experimental Methods in Animal  Behavior, will be developed. 
              Principles covered will  include classical methods, as well as new techniques, 
              including paternity analysis and the use of digitally-  altered videos to test
              behaviors.
