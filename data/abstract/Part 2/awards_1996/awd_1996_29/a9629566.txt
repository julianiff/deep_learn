Abstract    :
              9629566 Tilman    Biodiversity and the Productivity, Stability, and
              Sustainability of Prairie Ecosystems    Because of deforestation, urbanization,
              and other expansions of human land use, species are going extinct at
              unprecedented rates.  This has raised concerns about the possible long-term
              effects of the loss of species on the functioning of Earth's ecosystems. 
              Although there are many hypotheses about such potential effects, these ideas
              have almost never been directly tested under field conditions.  Such tests are
              important not just to resolve the scientific debate, but to provide society
              with information on the likely ecological impacts of the loss of biodiversity. 
              This research will maintain and monitor a uniquely powerful field experiment in
              which there is direct experimental control of plant biodiversity in 342 large
              prairie-like plots.  This work will determine if and how the productivity of
              these ecosystems depends on biodiversity.  The effects of biodiversity will
              also be studied on the sustainability of soil fertility, and on ecosystem
              stability.  This will provide a rigorous test of the hypothesized dependencies
              of ecosystem functioning on biodiversity.
