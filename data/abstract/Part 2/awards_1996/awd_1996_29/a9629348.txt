Abstract    :
              9629348  Wofford    The 470,000-specimen herbarium of the University of
              Tennessee contains   significant collections of fungi, bryophytes, and lichens
              in addition to vascular   plants primarily from Tennessee and the southern
              Appalachians.  At present,   the collection is overcrowded, and some specimens
              are stored in substandard   cases.  This project will purchase a compactor
              system and 152 new cabinets,   some of which will replace substandard ones, but
              most of which will provide   expansion space and space for future growth of the
              collection.  The University   is partnering with the NSF by providing building
              renovation and increased   floor space for all its collections including the
              herbarium; this will be   complete by late 1998.  As a result of this project,
              the specimens will be better   curated, and therefore more accessible for
              scientific study (particularly in   support of a PEET project) and education.
