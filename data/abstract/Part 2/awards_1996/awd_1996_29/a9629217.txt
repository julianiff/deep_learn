Abstract    :
                  9629217  Hess  An PFF/PECASE award will fund a study of the mutual 
              interactions of surface friction and non-linear vibrations  of machinery,
              machinery components, and fasteners.  Emphasis  will be on friction-induced
              vibrations and their dynamic  coupling with angular motions.  The instructional
              component  of the project includes development of outreach software and  an
              Internet site for high school students as well as an  industrial experience
              program for graduate students.  ***
