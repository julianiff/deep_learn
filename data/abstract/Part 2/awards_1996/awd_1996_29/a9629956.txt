Abstract    :
              9629956  Cao    The philosophical theme of the meeting hinges on exploiting the
              analogy   between piezoelectricity of ferroelectric ceramics, piezocomposites 
              and flexoelectricity of certain liquid crystals. This analogy will embrace  
              experimental, modelling, computational, analytic as well as industrial   
              problems and mathematical methods arising in the study of such solid and  
              liquid materials. It will simultaneously address issues related to processing
              and applications of polymeric liquid crystals, functional ceramics and
              composites.  In a broader sense, solid materials with electromechanical or  
              magnetomechanical coupling belong to a general category of ferroic materials. 
              %%%  The purpose of this interdisciplinary conference is bringing together  
              researchers from interacting areas of Materials Science, including   Physics
              and Applied Mathematics, with special focus on the latest   scientific and
              industrial developments in materials which are  currently used in computer
              display devices, smart structures, sensing and   control devices. Through the
              interchange among different disciplines, we hope  to channel the expertise of
              mathematicians and physicists to more practical  problems and to form new
              constructive research groups to tackle such problems.  Details of the workshop
