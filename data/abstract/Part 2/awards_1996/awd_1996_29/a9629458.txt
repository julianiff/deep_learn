                                       Abstract       The project will focus on using
              chitosan to develop microporous membranes for affinity separations.  Compared
              to currently available membranes based on nylon or cellulose, the proposed
              membranes have the advantage of containing numerous hydrophilic sites (OH,
              NH2).  Preliminary experiments show high adsorption capacities for human serum
              albumin but poor mechanical properties.  The objectives of the project are to
              improve the mechanical properties by preparing composite membranes based on
              chitosan, to increase the adsorption capacity by introducing metal-chelating
              groups via molecular imprinting, and to improve the permeability by controlling
              pore size   The project may lead to the development of superactive membranes
              useful for protein separations in biotechnology.
