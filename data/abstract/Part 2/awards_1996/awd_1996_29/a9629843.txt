Abstract    :
              Licciardi, Joseph M  Oregon State University   Significant climate variability
              at higher-than-orbital frequencies is now recognized as an important signal in
              late Pleistocene ice and sediment records from the circum-North Atlantic
              region.  Records elsewhere also reveal climate variability at millennial
              timescales and identify important but poorly understood mechanisms of climate
              change.  This doctoral dissertation project will examine the record of
              late-Pleistocene glaciers in the western U.S.  Better dating of the record and
              identification of the mechanisms of its associated climate signal are
              objectives which will lead to a fuller understanding of the spatial and
              temporal ranges of climate change in this region.  The intent is to develop an
              improved numerical chronology of mountain glaciation using newly developed
              surface exposure methods and apply these to numerous glacial moraines in
              mountain ranges of the western U.S.  The primary objective is to establish
              production rates of cosmogenic nuclides from radiocarbon-dated flows.  Results
              of the research will shed new light on our understanding of stratigraphic
              complexity from one mountain range to another.  It will also serve to reveal
              the variation in climate in this region over the past 50,000 years.
