Abstract    :
              9629825  Schultz  This is a grant under the GOALI initiative in the Polymer
              Program in  the Division of Materials Research.  The principal investigators,
              Dr.  Jerold Schultz (University of Delaware) and Dr. B. S. Hsiao (DuPont 
              Central Research and Development) are proposing to study the  development of
              structure in polymers in situ during processing.  Primary to this study is the
              use of synchrotron radiation to obtain  small- and wide-angle x-ray scattering
              results during spinning and  post-spinning processes.  The research will focus
              especially on the  earliest stages of structure formation, where the structure
              which  ultimately controls fiber behavior is initiated and in which the  course
              of the remainder of the transformation is set.  The synchrotron  work will be
              carried out at NSLS and APS in this country and at DESY  in Germany, using one-
              and two-dimensional detectors, with processing  apparatus which simulates
              industrial practice operating at the  beamline.  %%%  This study utilizes the
              GOALI initiative to weld industrial and  academic personnel and resources for
              long range fiber research.  The  objective of this study is to obtain new
              knowledge towards fundamental  fiber manufacturing processes, using newly
              available and highly  appropriate synchrotron X-ray techniques.  Such knowledge
              is lacking  today, but is crucial to future process and product improvement in
              the  fiber industry.  Additionally, the project will provide a unique 
              opportunity for graduate students to apply state-of-the-art science to 
              industrially relevant problems in a joint university/industry setting.  ***
