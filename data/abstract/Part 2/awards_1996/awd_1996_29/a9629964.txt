Abstract    :
              Professor John Pople is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and  
              Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in the   application
              of molecular orbital theory to a range of chemically   important problems. 
              Molecular orbital theory, as applied by Professor   Pople has become an
              integral part of chemistry used not only by   theoreticians, but also by a wide
              range of experimental chemists.   His   methods have proved to be an invaluable
              complimentary tool to much of   experimental chemistry.    Pople plans to
              continue his algorithm development and research in the   following three areas:
               1) Research will continue on the foundations of   density functional theory. 
              These include further investigations into   density functional theory, where
              the two-electron density will be   investigated. The aim  of this work is to
              find improved   exchange-correlation functionals.  2)The second area is
              concerned with   extensions of theoretical thermochemistry.  The aim here is to
              improve on   the current model used to predict energies of small systems. 
              Several   areas which form the basis of the model will be examined and
              improved.    3) The third involves the use of Object Oriented Classes in
              scientific   programming.  This is a continuation of work begun in the previous
              grant   period whose aim is to provide a more general implementation of  
              post-Hartree-Fock correlation theories.
