Abstract    :
              ***  CMS 9629871  Mittler  Following Hurricane Hugo, the Loma earthquake,
              Hurricane  Andrew, Hurricane Iniki, and the Northridge earthquake, some  states
              undertook significant disaster mitigation initiatives  while others did not. 
              This study examines why and how  several states decided to take on
              responsibilities for  seismic and hurricane safety.  Fourteen case studies will
              be  conducted in these states involving the collection of  detailed information
              from numerous sources including key  policy officials, commissions, agencies
              and state  associations. This study is especially timely because  recently
              enacted and proposed natural disaster mitigation  laws have sought to create or
              improve the capacity of states  to develop mitigation policies and programs. 
              In addition to  its theoretical contribution, one possible benefit of the 
              study will be to shed light on how states can improve their  ability to
              transfer useful technologies initiated by other  states.***
