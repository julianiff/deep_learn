Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: DMS-9629078  Gallian    With one exception, every year since
              1977, the principal  investigator has directed a summer undergraduate research
              program  in discrete mathematics at the University of Minnesota, Duluth.   The
              program has an extraordinary record of attracting the  nation's top talent and
              producing professional level research.    Over the years a tradition has
              evolved whereby former program  participants who are in graduate school or have
              obtained a Ph.D.  have returned for lengthy visits to assist with the program. 
              The  visitors take part in all aspects of the program and serve as  live-in
              councilors and role models for the undergraduates.
