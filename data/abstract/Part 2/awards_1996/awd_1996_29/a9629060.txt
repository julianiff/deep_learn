Abstract    :
              9629060  Yin  The long term objective of this research is to develop a  general
              methodology for the design, manufacture, and  implementation of molecular-scale
              machines that are able to  recognize and manipulate components in their
              environment.  Examples include machines that would synthesize novel  materials,
              or process genetic information at the molecular  level.  Such machines do not
              currently exist.  However,  insights toward their realization may be obtained
              by  focusing on viruses, biological entities that embody many of  the desired
              characteristics.  ***
