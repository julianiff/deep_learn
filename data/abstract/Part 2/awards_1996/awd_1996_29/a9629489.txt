Abstract    :
                9629489    Lozier    This project is a CAREER program in which the PI will
              integrate  research and teaching in her overall career development.   Under 
              the educational component, the PI will develop a new undergraduate  course in
              physical oceanography designed for science majors.  With  the aim of teaching
              how the study of physical oceanography relates  to our natural environment, the
              course would fill a serious void in  current undergraduate education.  In
              addition, the PI will develop  an extensive outreach program for advanced high
              school students.  Under the research component, the PI will study the
              structure,  extent and role of recirculations below the main thermocline in the
               North Atlantic, motivated by a new, high-resolution climatology  developed in
              large part by her.  With initial focus on the North  Atlantic, extensions will
              be made into the South Atlantic as the  data become available.  A forward model
              will be used in the later  stages of the study to begin to assimilate the data
              into a  theoretical framework.
