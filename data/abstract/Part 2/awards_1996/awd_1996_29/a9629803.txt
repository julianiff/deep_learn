Abstract    :
              The research team proposes to examine the effectiveness of four methods of
              disseminating education information to faculty in chemistry and mathematics. 
              The study intends to ascertain which approaches are found to be more "
              interactive" in nature and which are found to effect instructional behavior
              most directly.
