Abstract    :
              This award supports a conference designed to encourage interdisciplinary work
              between social scientists, demographers, and statisticians.  The conference
              honors the late Clifford C. Clogg, Distinguished Professor of Sociology and
              Professor of Statistics, Pennsylvania State University and is co-sponsored by
              the Government Statistics and Social Statistics Section of the American
              Statistical Association and the Methodology Session of the American
              Sociological Association.  The conference will have invited sessions in the
              important areas of Labor Force Demography, Demographic Methodology, Latent
              Variable Models in Social Science, Official Statistics, Categorical Data
              Analysis, Mixture Models, Analysis of Missing Data, and Model Selection Indices
              and Strategies.  In addition, contributed sessions and poster sessions allow
              new researchers to share their research with the invited participants and other
              attendees, and will provide a unique opportunity for continuing existing
              collaborations and stimulating new interactions between these disciplines.
