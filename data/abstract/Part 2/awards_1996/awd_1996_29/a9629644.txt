Abstract    :
              Schubert    Funding for this proposal will provide supplementary funding for an
              interdisciplinary Gordon Conference titled "Composition, Structure and Dynamics
              of the Earth's Interior" aimed at addressing major unanswered questions about
              the composition and structure of the Earth and the dynamics of it's deep
              interior.  This is the first Gordon Conference on this research topic, and NSF
              funding will be used to match funding from the Gordon Research Conferences. 
              The conference will be held June 30-July 4, 1996 at Plymouth State College in
              Plymouth, New Hampshire.  Funds will be used to partially support invited
              speakers, students, and participants located far from New Hampshire.
