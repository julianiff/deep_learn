Abstract    :
              9629539  David J. Anderson     The number of offspring that individuals can
              produce depends on the amount of food and care they can provide.  Birds are
              good organisms to study how foraging, resource allocation among offspring, and
              sibling competition affect the number of young produced.  Three sets of  birds
              will be studied.  In the first project, the foraging patterns of widely ranging
              seabirds, Laysan and black-footed albatrosses near the Hawaiian Islands, will
              be used to test hypotheses linking their slow reproductive rates to their
              foraging biology.  The data will be distributed in near-real time to over
              39,000 fifth and sixth grade students via email and educational satellite
              networks.  These students will participate in the data analysis, to increase
              their scientific literacy and to attract them to scientific careers.  The
              second project will study nestling competition in two species of boobies,
              seabirds of the Galapagos Islands. The regulation of sibling competition will
              be studied, to understand why a nestling bird sometimes kills its sibling
              nestmate.  The third project will study variation in offspring sex ratio in
              broods of the American kestrel.  Mothers provide sons with larger eggs,
              although sons die more than daughters do from sibling competition. 
              Undergraduate students will use DNA fingerprinting to determine how this size
              difference arises.    These studies will increase the understanding of
              tradeoffs in allocating resources, for number of offspring versus their
              survival rates.  This is useful for plant and animal breeding and for
              conservation biology.
