Abstract    :
              9629037  Verdoorn    Glutamate receptors are proteins that help brain cells 
              communicate with each other.  These receptors recognized the  chemical
              signaling molecular glutamate and generate an  electrical signal when glutamate
              is found.  The proposed  studies attempt to understand the mechanism whereby
              the  glutamate receptor protein specifically recognizes  glutamate.  A goal of
              this project is to purposely alter the  structure of the receptor protein and
              then study how the  alteration changes the action of glutamate on the receptor.
               The receptor will be studied by a technique for measuring  the tiny electrical
              currents generated by the receptor.  This technique is called patch clamp and
              can be used to  examine the behavior of a single glutamate receptor protein  in
              real time.  The studies will be guided by models of the  shape of the glutamate
              receptor protein in the area that  recognizes glutamate.  These high resolution
              technologies  will eventually allow the design of drugs that will alter  the
              behavior of glutamate receptors.  Such drugs may be  useful in the treatment of
              epilepsy, stroke, traumatic head  injury, and memory problems.
