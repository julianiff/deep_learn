Abstract    :
                9629268   Wallace    Stream Ecosystem Response to Decoupling
              Terrestrial-Aquatic Linkages    This project involves wood removal and
              continued leaf exclusion from a headwater stream. During the last 3 years, leaf
              exclusion from a 180 meter reach of stream has resulted in decreased animal
              production, shifts to alternative foods, increased relative importance of
              algae, increased export of small organic and inorganic particles, less within
              stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) generation, and longer nutrient uptake
              lengths compared to a stream with normal inputs of leaves.  Some results were
              unexpected, such as greater microbial activity on inorganic substrates and wood
              and no decrease in either organic matter quality or nutrient export.  Microbial
              biofilms, growing on the surfaces of wood and  inorganic substrates, and
              increased algal growth are now important nutrient sinks in the leaf exclusion
              stream. Wood remains a conspicuous and prevalent form of terrestrially derived
              organic matter.  This project will continue leaf exclusion and remove small
              (year 1) and large wood (year 3) to reduce: a) metabolically active microbial
              biofilms on wood, b) physical stability of the stream, c) particle and nutrient
              retention, and d) a large but refractory (wood) terrestrial input.  The two
              stage manipulation allows the investigators to distinguish the food resource
              role and structural role of wood in streams.  This long-term, ecosystem-level
              manipulation on this detritus-based food web will improve general understanding
              of the role of important terrestrial linkages to the structure and function of
              stream ecosystems.
