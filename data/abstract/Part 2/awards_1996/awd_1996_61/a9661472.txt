Abstract    :
                ***  9661472  Cooper     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              Project will prototype InterCam, a system for providing interactive,
              telerobotically-controlled, live video on the world-wide web. The InterCam
              system will be based on an operational research system developed earlier bar
              the project principles.  To establish commercial viability, it must be
              determined whether the system can be developed on a cost-effective
              hardware/software infrastructure, as well as important additional
              functionality.  A new system on an Intel/Windows NT platform will be developed.
                Also to be done will be re-engineering of the timesharing functionality at
              the heart of the software as a multithreaded distributed operating system,
              exploiting the multiprocessing functionality, and platform transparency of
              Java, new shareable control methods. and exploring the plausibility of
              incorporating basic computer vision capabilities into the system.   It is hard
              to overstate the potential impact of this technology. Many different concrete
              application areas have been identified such as: teleconferencing ("look where
              you want to look"), security, remote process monitoring accessible from
              anywhere, affordably, Internet publishing, and product and real-estate
              marketing (the virtual ahowroom or open-house)  ***
