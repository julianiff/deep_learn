Abstract    :
              ***  9661424  Bruce     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will develop time series methodology for treating long memory time series.  The
              methodology will use FARIMA (fractional autoregressive, integrated, moving
              average) processes, a class of processes that expands the standard
              autoregressive, integrated, moving average processes to include a long memory
              component.  The phase I research will extend existing FARIMA modeling
              methodology in the following areas:  (i) model selection; (ii) robust parameter
              estimation; (iii) estimation for time series with missing values; and (iv)
              assessment of assumptions behind FARIMA modeling by use of the wavelet
              variance.  A practitioner's casebook illustrating and guiding the use of FARIMA
              models in science and engineering will also be developed.  Time series commonly
              encountered in geophysics, oceanography, astronomy, electrical engineering,
              economics, physiology and other disciplines exhibit the properties of a long
              memory process.  The essence of such a process is that correlation between
              random variables does not approach zero rapidly as the separation in time
              between the variables increases.  Use of standard time series methodology with
              long memory time series can lead to incorrect statistical analysis; e.g.,
              confidence intervals for the mean can be too optimistic by orders of magnitude.
               Long memory time series are fundamental to science, and a complete statistical
              methodology for handling these series will make a major contribution to
              scientific progress.     If successful, the research will lead to a software
              toolkit offering a complete statistical methodology for FARIMA modeling.  The
              toolkit will be marketed as an S-Plus module and licensed to other commercial
              applications.  Based on the practitioner's casebook, instructional material
              will be marketed both as books and hypermedia.  ***
