Abstract    :
                ***  9661256  Emerling    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project is to develop a MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) fabrication
              service that will be self-supporting after Phase I. We will use a MEMS
              technology demonstrated successfully by several laboratories. The process
              begins with a CMOS chip, available from many vendors, and applies a relatively
              simple mask-less postprocessing etch to produce pits, cantilever beams, and
              membranes. Researchers have used this technology to demonstrate a variety of
              MEMS devices.  This MEMS process leverages existing CMOS fabrication to create
              MEMS devices integrated monolithically with CMOS circuitry. The single
              postprocessing step requires no photolithography and no expensive equipment. 
              During Phase I preliminary design rules, guidelines, and examples will be
              developed and distributed to the MEMS community, and initial  designs will be
              solicited. We will install the fabrication equipment, and perform the
              processing of the initial run, returning parts to researchers for testing.   
              The proposed MEMS fabrication service will enable the research and development
              to keep our nation in the forefront of the commercialization of MEMS. The
              service will support commercialization by providing cost effective prototype
              fabrication and volume manufacturing.  ***
