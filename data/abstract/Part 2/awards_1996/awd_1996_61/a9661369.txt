Abstract    :
              ***  9661369  Chibante     This proposal explores the viability of solvent-free
              manufacture of the molecular form of carbon, know collectively as fullerenes.
              As part of an innovative design in the manufacturing process, it is proposed to
              utilize direct in situ sublimation of molecular fullerenes from the nascent
              "soot", during continuous on-line production.  Important parameters such as
              temperature gradient, inert gas pressure and residence time will be evaluated. 
              The evolution of this Phase I project will naturally grow into the Phase II
              program wherein three further major concepts will be implemented.  These
              advances will lead to more than an order magnitude decrease in production cost
              (<$300 /kg) in the short-term, and will set the precedent for large scale
              manufacture.     The proposed Phase I/II program will result in a marked
              decrease in cost and greatly increased availability and quality of these
              fundamental materials in the immediate future. The demand continues to grow
              rapidly and practical applications are within range of the lower anticipated
              costs.  ***
