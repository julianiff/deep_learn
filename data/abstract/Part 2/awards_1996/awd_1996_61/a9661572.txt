Abstract    :
              ***  9661572  Kalumuck    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project to be carried out by Dynaflow, Inc. is aimed at the development of an
              efficient cost-effective technology for treatment of water polluted with
              organic wastes including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by complete
              oxidation.  Such materials pose a major environmental health hazard at numerous
              industrial sites and laboratory facilities threatening air pollution and ground
              water contamination.  Complete oxidation by conventional means entails costly
              chemical treatment and often leads to carcinogenic end products, however.  The
              proposed research will apply hydrodynamic cavitation to induce oxidation in the
              bulk solution.  The novelty of this approach lies in the use of resonating
              cavitating jets to trigger wide spread cavitation.  The Phase I research will
              address the feasibility of the technique.  A detailed experimental
              investigation will be performed to assess the effects of jet type, operating
              conditions, and cavitation enhancement devices on the oxidation process.  The
              oxidation products will be chemically analyzed to provide a quantitative
              measure for the oxidation efficiency based on the power required.  Results will
              be compared with those of more conventional ultrasonic cavitation oxidation. 
              In the next phase of the research, scale up, optimization, and prototype issues
              will be addressed.   In response to a major national and international concern,
              the proffered technology for water treatment will provide a reliable
              cost-effective means for toxic waste handling and elimination of hazardous
              organic compounds such as dissolved VOCs resulting in safe end products.  ***
