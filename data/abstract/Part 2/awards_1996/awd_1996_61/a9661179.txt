              ***  ABSTRACT      9661179  Johnson     This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will explore the feasibility of using microtextured metal
              electrodes as the basis of electrolytic ultracapacitors. For load leveling and
              sustained function after many cycles, ultracapacitors promise to become an
              integral part of many advanced power systems, particularly for hybrid electric
              vehicles and remotely operated battery systems. Although lower in specific
              energy than batteries, ultracapacitors potentially have a high specific power,
              enabling a synergy with lower power, but higher energy capacity, batteries,
              flywheels, or fuel cells. Present ultracapacitor designs use a highly porous
              structure of carbon (activated, foamed, or aerogel) as a high surface area
              electrode. High capacitance is achieved by the double-layer of polar molecules
              extracted from the electrolyte, which follows the convoluted surface of the
              carbon-coated electrodes. We propose ultracapacitors based on microtextured
              metal electrodes made by ion beam sputtering. Microtextured metals should
              improve performance through increased conductivity and wettability, while
              maintaining large surface area and ease of manufacture. Such surfaces have
              previously demonstrated remarkable changes in secondary electron emission,
              battery electrode performance, and optical properties, all related to increased
              surface area. Similar enhancements of ultracapacitor electrodes promise to
              enable them to finally approach their theoretical performance limits.  
              Ultracapacitors are, in combination with relatively lower power but high energy
              sources, ideal components of hybrid power supplies. In typical applications of
              current ultracapacitor technology to electrical vehicles, analysis by the
              National Renewable Energy Laboratory predicts a reduction in peak battery power
              demanded by a factor of three or more, an increase in vehicle range of 50%, and
              a doubling of cycle life. Similar, or even greater, benefits to communication
              devices, computers, and motor-driv en systems could be expected from
              microtextured metal electrodes. ***
