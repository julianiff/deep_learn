Abstract    :
              ***  96-61335  Spiegelberg     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              program will develop an affordable instrument for measuring normal forces in
              polymeric materials subjected to simple shearing flows. Rheological
              characterization, or the flow behavior of a material, provides essential
              information both about the chemical structure of a polymeric material and about
              the desirable processing conditions. A polymeric material subjected to a simple
              shear flow will exert a force in the direction normal to the flow direction,
              which is a direct measurement of the elasticity of the material. Only two
              companies produce a rheometer capable of measuring quantitative normal forces,
              and these retail for close to $100,000. This firm proposes to use affordable
              OEM force transducer technology to construct a normal force device for
              integration with existing shear rheometers without normal force capability,
              making use of the precision motors and controllers in these units. A second
              stand-alone rheometer will be constructed with its own drive motor for those
              without a shear rheometer.    The application of the technology to on-line
              measurements in a process flow line will be examined. It is anticipated that
              the add-on unit will retail for less than $10,000.  ***  ??
