Abstract    :
              ***  9661341  Farrar   This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I to be
              carried Montec Associates, Inc. project presents a novel mechanical method to
              cause low-frequency, sonic-energy driven cavitation of liquids for application
              as an advanced oxidation reactor.  Local high temperatures (>5000  C), high
              pressures (several hundred atmospheres) and high shear forces have been
              demonstrated to occur within cavitation bubbles generated by ultrasonics.  The
              high energy environment created during implosion of the cavitation bubble acts
              as a "microreactor" to enable and/or to accelerate chemical reactions.  The
              production of hydroxyl ions and peroxide for use as an aggressive oxidant via
              ultrasonically induced cavitation is well documented.  The proposed technology,
              termed ResonantSonics, has been used at Montec to produce highly energetic
              cavitation in liquids and slurries at low-frequencies, e.g., <2000 Hertz.  The
              ability to cause cavitation with low-frequency sonics has profound
              implications, as it overcomes the severe scaling and cost restrictions that
              have prevented the commercial ultrasonic processing applications.  Exploratory
              tests conducted at Montec have demonstrated that ResonantSonics can destroy
              (oxidize) cyanide and greatly enhance removal of cyanide and fluoride, as well
              as heavy metals, from contaminated materials.  The results of these exploratory
              experiments provide a strong motivation for Montec to develop ResonantSonics as
              a viable commercial advanced oxidation process.   The technology has the
              potential to provide a viable, sonochemical means, suitable for efficient
              scale-up to destroy or convert a broad range of hazardous waste types. 
              Commercial applications are numerous and include treatment of mixed and
              hazardous wastes at government and industrial sites.  ***
