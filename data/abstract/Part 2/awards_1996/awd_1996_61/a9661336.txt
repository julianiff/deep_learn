Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9661336  Swett     This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project addresses the design of an electromechanical battery for
              power-assist vehicle applications. Of the various candidate technologies for
              energy storage on board a hybrid electric vehicle, flywheels require only an
              evolutionary rate of progress in terms of materials science development. During
              Phase I, design issues associated with rotor constitution out of three types of
              carbon fiber will be addressed as will the design of the hub, the permanent
              magnet motor, and the suspension/bearings subassemblies. Phase I also includes
              the design of a containment housing with appropriate energy dissipation and
              release mechanisms in the unlikely event of rotor failure. Phase II of this
              effort will address the fabrication of engineering prototypes and the
              validation of the Phase I design with the goal of having a producible and
              manufacturable prototype design. Also during Phase II, the engineering
              feasibility of the prototype design will be demonstrated through projections in
              reductions of materials costs due to economies of scale as well as
              manufacturing costs by proper selection of processes.   The target cost of the
              electromechanical battery system to be developed in this multi-phase research
              effort is $500-800 per kWh of energy. The target performance is an
              electromechanical battery system with an energy storage of 3 kWh, a maximum
              power of 88 kW, a specific energy of 50 Wh/kg, a specific power of 1.4 kW/kg
              and a life over 1 million cycles. Successful development of flywheels that
              achieve the targeted cost and performance will enable their integration as
              power-assist devices into hybrid electric vehicles. ***
