Abstract    :
              ***  96-61604  Marjadi    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will develop and test an innovative software tool which will merge the
              tasks of design and structural analysis into one concurrent task.  This
              innovation has the potential for dramatic reduction of design cycle time by
              reducing the iterative process of analytical validation into one single
              concurrent design step.  The technology of topology optimization will be
              combine with the emerging h-p adaptive meshless (Clouds) method of structural
              analysis.  For given package space and loads and boundary conditions, this
              method will compute structures which are optimum in terms of topology as well
              as size and shape.  The error prediction feature of the h-p adaptive method
              will hold the modeling and computational errors within user prescribed bounds,
              thus significantly reducing design iterations, which are the most costly and
              time consuming portions of the design process.  Phase I will merge the two
              technologies with analysis formulation efforts focused on linear static
              analysis using two-dimensional structures.  Phase II would include design for
              more practical three-dimensional solids and shells.    Commercial applications
              of this software tool are expected with mechanical designers and computer aided
              engineering (CAE) experts, particularly in the automotive and aerospace
              industries.  ***
