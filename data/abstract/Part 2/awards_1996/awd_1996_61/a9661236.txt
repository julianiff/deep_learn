Abstract    :
              ***  9661236  Treadwell        This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project aims to develop low-cost, processable precursors to numerous
              aluminosilicates. Certain modified silatranes and aluminum carboxylates form
              water stable solutions suggesting the potential for water processable
              aluminosilicate precursors. The phase I objectives are: (1) develop an
              understanding of the dissolution processes that control the rates of formation
              of mullite, spinel and cordierite precursors; (2) examine simple methods of
              modifying aluminum alkoxides to determine water solubility and stability and
              scale up; and (3) characterize the processability and physical properties of
              these polymer types.                If this approach is successful it could
              lead to significantly less expensive ceramic coatings and composites.   ***
