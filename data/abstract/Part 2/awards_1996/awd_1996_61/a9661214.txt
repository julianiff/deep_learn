Abstract    :
              ***  9661214  Shalaby     This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research
              project will use  a novel process for the surface-modification of organic
              polymers to chemically activate ultrahigh molecular weight, high tenacity,
              polyethylene fibers and determine their effectiveness in reinforcing organic
              polymeric matrices and Portland cement.  Phase I entails the surface activation
              of the fibers to provide physicochemical compatibility with typical epoxy and
              acrylic resin matrices characterized and then evaluated for basic and
              application-relevant properties and compared with non-reinforced controls as
              well as controls based on untreated fibers.  Results of Phase I study will be
              used to identify the most promising type (or types) of composites for further
              development and optimization in Phase II.    Successful development of the
              proposed composites is expected to provide novel high-performance,
              cost-effective materials. These materials have a broad range of applications
              including those associated with structural epoxy composites (used in aircraft,
              automotive and sports equipment), high toughness dental and orthopedic acrylic
              composites (for prostheses), and impact-resistant cement composites (for
              construction of panels, rehabilitation of deteriorating bridges, and
              installation or repair of pavement).
