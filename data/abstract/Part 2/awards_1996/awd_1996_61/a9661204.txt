Abstract    :
              ***  96-61204  Keicher    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project is an extension of current rapid prototyping technology.  Rapid
              prototyping systems allow manufacturers to reduce design cycle time by
              producing prototype plastic parts directly from computer generated designs.  A
              related emerging technology, the Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) process,
              currently being developed at Sandia National Laboratories, has produced
              near-net-shape functional parts directly from computer generated designs. 
              Commercial use of this technology, beyond the military defense applications for
              which it was developed, are thought to be possible.  Phase will apply this
              technology to rapid tooling for injection molds by designing a mold for a
              simple geometry, producing the mold using the LENS process, and then using the
              mold to actually produce a quantity of plastic parts for evaluation.    This
              technology is thought to have significant applications for commercial
              utilization within the tooling industry due to its potential of saving time and
              cost in the preparation of tooling hardware.  ***
