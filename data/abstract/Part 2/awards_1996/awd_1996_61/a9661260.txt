Abstract    :
              ***  9661260  Daniels   This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project
              to be carried out by Quality Air Heating & Cooling of Midland, Inc. will
              demonstrate the feasibility of identifying microbial volatile organic compounds
              (MVOCs) by high-speed gas chromatography (HSGC) for possible control of
              antimicrobial engineered processes.  Variations in sources, process conditions,
              building activities, and environmental factors produce concentration patterns
              that require rapid and continuous monitoring.  Existing monitors are limited to
              simple mixtures, and are restricted by high detection levels and slow analysis
              times.  HSGC can potentially speciate and resolve complex mixtures of MVOCs at
              low detection levels (< 0.1 ppb) and short analysis times (< 10 sec.  Microbes
              and MVOCs which adversely affect indoor air quality (IAQ) are of interest to
              industrial hygienists, research administrators,
              heating/ventilation/air-conditioning (HVAC) system designers, and environmental
              health officials.  MVOCs are associated with outdoor air, building materials,
              occupants, and HVAC systems.   The proposed HSGC monitor would provide rapid
              detection of MVOCs from microbes having potential health effects; more
              efficient operation of HVAC systems; improved design and construction of IAQ
              systems; and better control of engineered antimicrobial processes.  The
              technology has utility in detection, prevention, and control of MVOCs
              associated with hospital; remediation sites; pollution prevention activities;
              production processes; and natural environments.  ***
