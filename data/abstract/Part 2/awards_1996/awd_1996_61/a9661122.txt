Abstract    :
              ***  96-61122    Barrall    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
              I project will magnetic resonance (MR) viscometry and develop specifications
              for a commercial MR viscometer.  Many manufacturing and processing technologies
              depend on the flow or rheological properties of fluids, suspensions, slurries,
              or melts.  For example, the steady-state shear-dependent viscosity of
              thermopolymers is often indicative of key properties such as molecular weight
              and molecular weight distribution.  Viscometric measurement of molecular weight
              distribution requires measuring shear viscosity over two or three decades in
              shear rate with at least five points per decade.  Current in-line and on-line
              viscometers are not capable of making the required measurements quickly enough
              to allow real-time process control.  The MR viscometer will measure shear
              viscosity over two decades in shear rate within one minute (about 30 times
              faster than the present state of the art).  It will be noninvasive, capable of
              investigating particulate-filled systems (which can clog present viscometers),
              and amenable to large flow streams.  The MR viscometer will further be capable
              of simultaneously measuring other important properties such as diffusion
              coefficients, of which present viscometers are incapable.    A low-cost,
              in-line system to measure viscosity over several decades in shear rate will
              find wide application in industries that process melts, slurries, and
              emulsions.  Target markets include thermoplastics, resins, petroleum
              derivatives, heterogeneous food products, coal, paper, and waste disposal
              management.  ***
