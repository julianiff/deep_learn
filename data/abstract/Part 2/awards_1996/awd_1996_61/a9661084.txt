Abstract    :
              ***  96-61084  Sayanl     This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will investigate an optical correlator for tracking and identifying
              objects in a cluttered or noisy field.  Filter algorithms for improved signal
              to noise and reduced rotation dependence will be developed and tested in the
              optical correlator system with multiple in-class and out-of-class objects.   
              Commercial applications include manufacturing process control, automation
              inspection, image analysis, and surveillance.  ***
