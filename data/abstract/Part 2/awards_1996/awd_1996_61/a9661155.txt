Abstract    :
              ***  96-61155  Wisner    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will test a new process for recycling painted automotive thermoplastic
              parts.  Recycling these products is hampered by residual paint particles in the
              recycled material.  The new process focuses on 1) segregating the individual
              plastics, 2) debonding the paint chemically and removing it, 3) recovering the
              thermoplastics, and 4) assuring that the recycled plastics meet the critical
              needs of the end user.  The goal is to deliver recycled material with
              properties very near virgin material at a cost lower than the virgin price.   
              Commercial applications are expected in various plastics manufacturing
              operations, such as automobile bumpers, where high-quality recycled plastics
              are needed.  In large scale use, plastics recycling could save one-third of all
              waste materials now being discarded in landfills.  ***
