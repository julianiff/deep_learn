Abstract    :
              ***  9661717  Hu     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will study the problem of reconstructing a three dimensional object from its
              projections acquired with a large area detector and cone-shaped x-ray beams.
              This problem is fundamental to the volumetric computerized tomography (CT)
              scanner development and has not yet been successfully solved.  Based on the
              concept of function decomposition developed by the Principal Investigator, a
              "hybrid-type" reconstruction algorithm for the circle-and-line scanning orbit,
              consisting of a circular scan and a linear scan has been explored.  In this
              project, the remaining problems associated with this algorithm will be studied.
               Specifically, the numerical accuracy and computational efficiency of this
              algorithm will be further improved by selecting the optimal theoretical
              formulation and numerical implementation.  Furthermore, the algorithm will be
              extended to handle the object that is taller than the detector.  This situation
              routinely occurs in practice.  It will be demonstrated that this hybrid-type
              algorithm will combine the strengths and eliminate the weakness of existing
              algorithms and therefore could become the preferable algorithm for cone beam
              scanner development     The successful development of this algorithm will
              accelerate the commercialization of the fast volumetric CT scanner.  With
              drastic improvement in throughput and volume scanning capability, application
              of this technology will generate fundamental impacts in the fields of medicine,
              manufacturing industry, material science and engineering.  ***
