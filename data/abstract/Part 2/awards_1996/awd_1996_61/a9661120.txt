Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9661120  Halverson     This Small Business Innovation
              Research Phase I project will investigate the development of a highly efficient
              extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) source for absolute intensity and wavelength
              calibration of UV spectrometers and detectors, space environment simulation,
              accelerated environmental testing, and EUV surface treatments. An existing UV
              light source, with electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma heating, has
              already demonstrated emission at wavelengths down to 30 nm. The goal of this
              Phase I effort is to generate powerful EUV radiation at even shorter
              wavelengths. The ECR-heated plasma, when driven by a "Lisitano coil" that
              maximizes microwave coupling, should produce multiply-charged ions with strong
              spectral features down to 5-10 nm. During Phase I, Spire will test a prototype
              Lisitano coil for microwave coupling efficiency; operate the existing UV light
              source in a modified magnetic field configuration to attain lower pressure,
              higher temperature ECR-heated plasmas with enhanced EUV emission; measure EUV
              output; and design a new light source with Lisitano coil excitation that will
              be built, tested, and calibrated in Phase II.   The EUV light source will have
              much higher intensity, reliability, and reproducibility than duoplasmatrons and
              arcs and much lower cost than synchrotron radiation sources.  In addition to UV
              instrument calibration, it will be valuable for accelerated environmental
              testing and surface treatment of medical and other products. ***
