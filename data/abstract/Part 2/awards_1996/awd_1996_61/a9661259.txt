Abstract    :
                ***  9661259  McAlindon     This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I is
              proposing a new approach to typing for typists with CTS. A new alphanumeric
              input device is proposed to address the ergonomic and efficiency needs of the
              physically disabled user. The device uses a pair of devices, each comprised of
              an inverted bowl upon which the hands comfortably rest. Its typing methodology
              entails creating a keystroke via a combination of positions of the two bowls.
              This combination of positions is called chording. Phase I evaluation will
              investigate the ergonomic, biomechanical, and typing performances of the new
              device. Such an evaluation will establish how effective the device may be in
              providing an alternative means of typing to those with physical disability of
              the upper extremity. Primary elements of evaluation include: character layout,
              motor skill requirements, physical and workload evaluation and memory
              requirements.   The device's potential for commercial success is enormous. The
              device's greatest commercial application lies in its ability to respond to any
              user's needs.  Outside of the disability realm, the device can be reduced in
              size without losing any of its functionality.  Portable computers could be made
              smaller, for example.  Another useful application of the device, because of its
              self containment, is in hostile environments.  The device can be completely
              sealed and still be fully functional; it can even be used under water.    ***
