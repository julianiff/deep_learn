Abstract    :
              ***  9661732  Redi      This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will introduce novel energy-saving protocols which are critical for the
              successful wide range commercial deployment of wireless tag networks. A myriad
              of applications are emerging in which communication between low speed - very
              low cost tags (wireless nodes) and base stations designates energy conservation
              as a critical system parameter, such as warehouse identification tags, hospital
              ID tags, smart tags, intelligent ID cards, to name only a few of these
              applications. Tags are small devices with radio or infrared
              reception/transmission and processing capabilities, integrated in the size of
              an ID card or smaller, designed for the lowest possible cost. Cost minimization
              and network size prohibit the replacement of batteries which need to last for
              as long as the object needs to be identified, from weeks to several years. The
              design of wireless access protocols for tag networks requires, therefore, that
              transmission of, often delay sensitive data, occur under critical energy
              conservation and cost constraints. As classical access protocols do not meet
              these requirements, this project will introduce and evaluate several novel
              classes of protocols designated for these emerging low speed - low cost
              networks.    The market potential for these systems is estimated at billions of
              dollars per year, underscoring the importance of this work.  ***
