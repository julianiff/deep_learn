Abstract    :
              ***  9661329  Shannon     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project involves the characterization of microorganisms capable of degrading
              the gasoline oxygenate methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and development of an in
              situ bioremediation process for treatment of MTBE-contaminated soils and
              aquifers.  MTBE has been used since 1979 as a high-octane additive to reduce
              the more toxic aromatic additives that have previously been used in gasoline. 
              Almost 18 billion pounds of MTBE were produced in the U. S. in 1995, and it
              accounts for up to 11% of the reformulated gasoline used by consumers.  Its
              widespread use has resulted in its accidental discharge and the subsequent
              contamination of aquifers and soils.  The U. S. Geological Survey has estimated
              that MTBE is the second most common water pollutant in urban ground waters. 
              Few studies have been done to evaluate the biodegradation and fate of MTBE.
              This research project will investigate MTBE degradation by an MTBE-degrading
              propane-oxidizing bacterial strain M. vaccae JOB5 and three MTBE-degrading
              strains recently isolated by the firm.  The study will determine rates and
              mechanisms of degradation, and systematically characterize the conditions
              needed for in situ biostimulation using model aquifers.     The cost of
              remediating leaking underground storage tanks has been estimated to be greater
              than $1.8 billion if we must rely on current technologies. The in situ
              technology developed during this project will be incorporated into the firm's
              existing remediation technologies to develop an economically feasible system
              for degrading MTBE.  The technology will be widely applicable at both
              government and private sites.  ***
