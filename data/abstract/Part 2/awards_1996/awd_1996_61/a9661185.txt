Abstract    :
              ***  96-61185  Kowbel    This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will investigate a low cost process to produce silicon carbide/silicon
              carbide (SiC-SiC) composites. These composites exhibit excellent mechanical,
              thermal, and corrosion properties.  Their applications in aerospace and
              energy-related areas are greatly hindered by high manufacturing costs, lack of
              oxidation stable interfaces, and selectively poor creep resistance of the SiC
              fibers.  Phase I will study a unique way to produce pure beta-SiC/beta-SiC
              composites via a direct chemical vapor reaction (CVR) of low-cost carbon-carbon
              (C-C) composites.  CVR-derived fibers are expected to exhibit excellent creep
              resistance, while an in-situ generated porous SiC interface is expected to
              provide good fiber pull-out and good environmental stability.    Lowering the
              cost of SiC-SiC composites not only will expand applications in aerospace
              industries, but also provide opportunities in civilian industries such as
              automotive, burners, combusters, process equipment, heat recovery equipment,
              and separation/filtration.  ***
