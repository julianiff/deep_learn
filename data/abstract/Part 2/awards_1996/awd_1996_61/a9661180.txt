Abstract    :
              ***  96-61180  Djuth      This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will develop solid state transmit/receive modules that are optimized
              for remote sensing of the Earth's atmosphere, ionosphere, and magnetosphere. 
              Such units would pave the way for a new generation of UHF phased array radar
              having greatly improved system performance and flexibility.  Projected system
              costs are significantly less than those of traditional radar.  Phase I will
              develop a new solid-state power amplifier, complementary antenna design, and an
              improved low-temperature transmit/receive switch.  A shift away from high-power
              tube amplifiers to distributed solid-state units will be examined.  The new
              radar can be configured for rapid tracking of dynamic geophysical events from
              the zenith to low elevation angles.  Because the system architecture is
              modular, it is well-suited for radar interferometry and can be incrementally
              expanded to sizes characteristic of a powerful incoherent scatter radar.  A
              very high sensitivity radar would require 4000-5000 modules.    Potential
              commercial applications include incoherent scatter radar development, radar
              tracking and imaging of airborne "hard targets," meteorological aids, radar
              wind profiling in the stratosphere and troposphere, high-power ground
              penetrating radars (for hydrological studies, detection of hazardous waste,
              oil/gas reserves), pagers, cellular telephone systems, and military
              communications.  ***
