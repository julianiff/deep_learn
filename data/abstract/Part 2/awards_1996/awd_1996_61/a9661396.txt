Abstract    :
              ***  9661396  Zappi     This project addresses selective fluorination in mild
              conditions.. The objective of the proposed research is to demonstrate high
              current densities and yields in selective fluorination reactions using custom
              designed soluble mediators and anodically regenerated solid phase fluorinating
              reagents. This will constitute a generic synthetic method for the selective
              substitution of fluorine into aliphatic carbon atoms, and special attention
              will be given to the applicability of the chemistry to larger scale operation. 
                            While the applications of  fluorinated drugs and specialty
              chemicals continue to expand, the synthetic methods for their preparation
              remain limited and case-specific. In most cases multi-step syntheses are
              required, and the overall yields are poor. A unique opportunity for the
              development of a new synthetic approach for the synthesis of a broad range of
              selectively fluorinated compounds has been identified. This method will give
              access to a wide range of existing compounds at more competitive prices and new
              compound for use in drugs, agrochemicals and other areas.
