Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      96-61235  O'Callaghan      This Small Business Innovation
              Research Phase I project aims to develop next generation analog and digital
              Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal (FLC)-VLSI spatial light modulators (SLMs) which
              surpass the speed of present generation SLMs by nearly an order of magnitude.
              In addition to their commercial use as miniature displays current generation
              FLC-VLSI SLMs are enabling long awaited, commercially viable, optical image
              processing systems whose computing speed outstrips purely electronic
              processors. When used as part of a computing subsystem the performance of
              present generation SLMs is enough to tax the data bandwidth capabilities of
              inexpensive general purpose digital computers. The intent of this Phase I
              effort is to greatly extend the performance of analogized digital FLC-VLSI SLMs
              to match or surpass the data throughput rates of current high performance
              digital systems. The plan is to achieve this goal by drawing on and extending
              combined advances in both VLSI design and FLC performance.   The proposed
              high-speed SLMs can be used in biometric applications such as fingerprint and
              face recognition, high-speed image processing, volumetric 3-D displays,
              industrial machine vision, and improved sequential color miniature displays.
