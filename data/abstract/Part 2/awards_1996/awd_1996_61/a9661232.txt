Abstract    :
              ***  96-61232  Srinivas      This Project will develop a novel class of
              catalysts to remove (Carbon Monoxide) CO from automobile exhaust during cold
              start. TDA Research has identified a novel class of catalysts that effectively
              remove CO at temperatures as low as 25 C. In addition to removing the CO, the
              heat generated during the oxidation of CO to CO2 is used to heat the three-way
              catalyst faster, leading to hydrocarbon oxidation. In Phase I, TDA will
              synthesize, characterize and test the activity of the catalysts for the removal
              of CO under cold start conditions. In Phase II, the catalyst will be supported
              on an inert carrier (ceramic monolith) and tested on a car to determine the
              efficiency under actual cold start conditions to bring the temperature of the
              catalyst up to operating temperature.                More than 40 million
              people, in 80 different cities, live in areas with CO levels that exceed EPA
              standards. Automobiles are by far the largest outdoor source of CO, and are
              also major sources of unburned hydrocarbons (HCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOX).
              Since the advent of automotive emissions regulations in the United States in
              1973, the allowable emissions of all three major pollutants have been
              continually reduced. Current three-way catalysts are not effective in reducing
              emissions at temperatures below 200 C (during cold start). Electrically heated
              catalyst, while effective, are large energy consumers, heavy, expensive and
              inconvenient. This new approach offers a cost effective alternative.     ***
