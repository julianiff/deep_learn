Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will evaluate the
              feasibility of pulsed-waterjet soil densification to mitigate against
              earthquake liquefaction.  Present methods to prevent liquefaction include
              various types of ground modification techniques that are generally high in
              cost.  The objective of the proposed work is to determine operating parameters
              required for deep compaction using pulsed waterjets and to evaluate the
              cost-effectiveness of this approach in comparison with existing methods.  A
              model of pulsed-waterjet soil densification will be developed based on the test
              results and a theoretical examination of densification mechanisms.  The model
              will be used to estimate the time and equipment required for ground compaction
              as a function of soil type and depth.  A comparison of the costs of the
              proposed technique with conventional ground compaction will be prepared as the
              basis for a full-scale demonstration.       Thousands of square miles of prime
              industrial zoned land in the United States lie unused because of poor soil
              foundations while the construction of industrial facilities on reclaimed
              coastal land is becoming more common as port and waterfront areas become more
              congested.  With billions of dollars in liquefaction-related damage during
              recent earthquakes in California and Japan, developers and others are looking
              for new ways to improve the performance of soils and structures under seismic
              conditions.  If proven feasible and cost effective, the proposed technique will
              have immediate application for new construction on loose soils and dredged fill
              worldwide.
