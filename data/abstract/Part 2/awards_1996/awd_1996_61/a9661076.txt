Abstract    :
              ***  9661076  Fortini     This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research
              project will develop high-capacitance electrodes that combine high surface area
              with the electric double-layer effect and fast, reversible faradaic processes
              at the electrode. This will be accomplished by infiltrating aerogels with
              precious metal oxides via a unique process. The net result will be an electrode
              with the surface area of an aerogel, but with the pseudocapacitance properties
              of ruthenium oxide (RuO2). The primary drawbacks of current electrochemical
              double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) are cost and power density. The EDLC electrode
              material that allows for the greatest specific capacitance is RuO2 which is
              based on an expensive platinum group metal. Thus, the cost of such capacitors
              is quite high. Furthermore, because electrode surface area is the key parameter
              for capacitance, and because current technology only allows dispersal of the
              oxide electrode material to surface areas of ~120 m2/g, the bulk of the oxide
              mass remains unused.   The optimization of high surface area, high-capacitance
              electrodes will have many applications in both the civilian and military
              sectors.  Civilian applications include electric automobiles, pulse power
              supplies for high-power lasers, burst power for high-power signal generation,
              and power conditioning for satellites.  Military applications include space
              power conditioning, laser weaponry, electronic fuses, safety and arming
              devices, and missile guidance systems.  ***
