Abstract    :
              ***  96-61064    Winstead    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
              Phase I project will develop and experimentally validate a comprehensive
              computational model for electromagnetically coupled metallurgical processes. 
              The model incorporates an efficient approach for predicting the interaction
              among electromagnetic, fluid dynamic, and heat transfer subsystems.  Phase I
              will demonstrate the feasibility of the unified approach by developing a
              two-dimensional model that solves for alternating magnetic fields, turbulent
              fluid dynamics, conjugate heat transfer, and phase change.  It will be capable
              of modeling processes that involve deformation and containment of
              free-surfaces, metal solidification, and particle transport.  Phase II would
              extend the model to three dimensions and additional electromagnetic
              configurations.    Commercial application of the computational model is
              expected in many material manufacturing processes involving electromagnetic
              fields.  These processes include induction furnaces, electromagnetic casting,
              refining, stirring, shaping, pumping, and braking systems.  ***
