Abstract    :
              ***  96-61043  He    This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will investigate a new method to minimize the evaporation of volatile
              colorants during the glass melting process.  This non-conventional method
              consists of extremely rapid melting (few seconds) and spheridization of
              colorant-rich glass spheres, which will be added to the molten glass,  By
              introducing these colorants in a pre-melted glassy form, the degree of
              volatilization which these materials currently demonstrate will be reduce.   
              Commercial application is expected in glass manufacture, where this process of
              producing colorant-rich glass spheres will allow the introduction of colorants
              in the form of a new raw material.  With less volatilization and higher
              retention in the finished glass product, glass manufacturers will benefit from
              lower raw material costs, greater process stability, and significant
              environmental improvements.  ***
