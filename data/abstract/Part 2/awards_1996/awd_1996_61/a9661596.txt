Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      96-61596  Kane      This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will develop an algorithm for the real-time inversion of
              spectrograms for ultrashort laser pulse measurement. Ultrafast laser systems
              have a large number of applications in biochemistry, chemistry, physics, and
              electrical engineering. These systems generate laser pulses with durations of
              10 picoseconds or less and such systems are used to explore kinetics in
              proteins, examine carrier relaxation in semiconductors, or image through turbid
              media. By using ultrafast diagnostic systems, highly advanced semiconductors,
              electronic circuitry, and even biomedical products can be developed and tested
              for commercial applications. Furthermore, new applications requiring shaped
              ultrashort pulses in both intensity and phase-such as coherent control of
              chemical reactions are beginning to be developed. The continued development of
              these applications will require, fast, high quality, and easy-to-use ultrafast
              laser pulse diagnostics. Frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG) has been
              proven to be a reliable and effective ultrashort laser pulse diagnostic, but
              requires an iterative algorithm to obtain the ultrashort pulse's
              characteristics (intensity and phase). Current inversion algorithms are slow.
              During the Phase I research effort, a new inversion algorithm will be developed
              that will obtain the intensity and phase of an ultrashort pulse from the FROG
              device's output in real time facilitating the development of a real-time
              oscilloscope for ultrashort laser pulses.   Immediate commercial applications
              are directed toward use as a diagnostic for existing ultrafast laser systems
              for which few are currently available. Other commercial applications for the
              algorithm include scanning transmission electron microscopy. ***
