Abstract    :
              ***  9661141  Kozakoff     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will investigate organic coatings that are both highly reflective in
              the microwave and in the optical frequency regime. The technical approach uses
              high density barium titanate glass microspheres in a suitable matrix material. 
              Loading with conductive micro fibers (or micro spheres) produces a radar
              reflective as well as an optically reflective surface.     This material will
              have many military applications.  For instance, if a pilot's helmet or raft
              were coated with such a material, during search and rescue, this would make the
              aircrew easy to spot from an airborne surveillance radar many miles away, long
              before they can be spotted visually.  The optically reflective feature would
              make them easy to see during mite rescue operations where search lights are
              employed.   These coatings can be used in the marking of other equipment, such
              as life vests and rafts, used by boaters in commercial uses.  ***
