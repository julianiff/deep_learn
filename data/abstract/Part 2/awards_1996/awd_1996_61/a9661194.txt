Abstract    :
              ***  9661194  Maren     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will prototype and demonstrate key technology components for an Intelligent
              Agent using Situation Assessment. This system will automatically provide pilots
              with high-fidelity, near real-time information that will help  in their
              decision-making under stress. Phase I will lay the foundation and will identify
              demonstration scenarios based on real accidents, construct emulations of these
              scenarios, and identify the "schemes" that pilots consistently use when doing
              selected piloting tasks. Key components of a pilot cognitive model will be
              identified, and an IA architecture will be developed. The key necessary
              learning methods for constructing user models also will be identified  and the
              first steps for their development will be taken.  Commercialization is expected
              for commercial, military, and general aviation systems. In addition, the IA
              technologies can be extended to assist operation of power plants, chemical
              refineries, and television station operation.  ***
