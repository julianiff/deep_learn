Abstract    :
              9661162  Prater  Electronic sound synthesis has become a very large market, with
              applications in PC sound cards and electronic musical instruments.  Significant
              opportunities exist at the low end of these markets for synthesis methods
              (implemented in chip form) with higher sound quality and low cost.  High end
              systems, implemented either in VLSI or as software running on a DSP chip, also
              present opportunities for synthesis solutions which give the user better
              dynamic sound quality.  This will provide significant improvements in musical
              dynamics.  Commercial applications include sound synthesis chips for PC sound
              cards and PC motherboard audio systems, and synthesis chips and DSP code for
              keyboard synthesizers.  Extensions of these algorithms may have applications in
              music post-processing, especially for guitar signal processors.  Improved sound
              synthesis technology based on novel filtering and synthesis methods to address
              both low end and high end market opportunities is envisioned.  For high end
              applications, an improved synthesis technique using time varying parameters in
              a wavetable may be possible.  For low end applications, postprocessing methods
              to remove the "electronic character" of FM sound synthesis, at minimal cost is
              feasible.
