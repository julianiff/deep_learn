Abstract    :
              ***  9661632  Bryant     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will investigate the unique combination of microencapsulation techniques and
              materials with biological herbicides (mycoherbicides) to offer a safe,
              host-specific, affordable alternative to chemical herbicides. The project will
              study ways to meet the critical environmental requirements of plant pathogenic
              fungi used as mycoherbicides and thus to make mycoherbicides practical and
              commercially viable for widespread agricultural use.  A major limitation of
              mycoherbicides has been the need for fastidious moisture and temperature ranges
              in order for them to be effective in the field.  This project will address the
              temperature and moisture requirements (both vital to the effectiveness of
              mycoherbicides) by extending (simulating) dew periods and regulating
              temperature on the plant surface.  Novel and innovative encapsulation
              techniques will combine water and/or nutrient solutions with microencapsulated
              phase change materials (microPCMs)- developed by Triangle R&D on multiple SBIR
              programs from 1984 to 1996 - in a form that can he successfully applied in the
              field.   A fungal pathogen/weed pathosystem will be selected as a model system
              and evaluated for compatibility of microencapsulated materials with the fungal
              pathogen and target weeds. The project will then design and fabricate water
              microcapsules to provide a range of moisture coverage periods, design and
              fabricate microPCMs to provide the optimum temperature range(s) and evaluate
              microencapsulated materials alone and in combinations to improve the weed
              control efficacy of the mycoherbicide.     Many promising mycoherbicides have
              been abandoned because of their seeming incompatibility with environmental
              conditions in the field.  If successful, the proposed work could significantly
              improve existing mycoherbicides, renew the development of previously abandoned
              mycoherbicides, and create broad applications in agriculture and environmental
              systems.  This would lead the way  to capturing a portion of the herbicide
              industry, which currently has annual sales in excess of 7 billion dollars.  ***
