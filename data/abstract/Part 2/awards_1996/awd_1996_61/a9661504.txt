Abstract    :
              9661504  Stoel  This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              is to meet the increasing need for commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components
              in the ever shrinking time to market in the electronics industry.  COTS
              components are readily available, less expensive, and increase efficiency of
              the design process, but negatively impact testability.  It is proposed to
              develop a methodology for enhancing testability of boards and systems
              implemented using COTS devices, and to provide the supporting tools.  The
              methodology will improve controllability and observabilitv in such board
              testing through (1) implementation of board-level JTAG boundary scan, (2)
              borrowing boundary scan included on some chips to test surrounding COTS
              components without boundary scan, and (3) integrating other test and diagnostic
              techniques such as board-level built-in self test (BIST) and IDDQ test using
              the 1149.1 standard boundary scan serial interface.  Industry standards (VHDL
              and Boundary Scan) support interoperabilitv with major EDA frameworks.  During
              Phase I, a prototype tool set will be developed for higher level (board,
              Multi-Chip Module, etc.) boundary scan and BIST insertion into VHDL designs. 
              In Phase II, tool set features and capabilities will be expanded, and product
              commercialization will begin.  The proposed test insertion methodology provides
              a solution to pressing problems faced by designers whose design requirements
              include high testability and use of untestable COTS components.  The new tool
              set will lower cost and save time in the design phase through use of commercial
              parts without the attendant compromises in testability.
