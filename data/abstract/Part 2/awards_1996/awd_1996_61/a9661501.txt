Abstract    :
              ***  9661501  Knudson         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will determine if a heterogeneous catalyst that will rapidly destroy
              chlorinated hydrocarbons can be produced from two waste materials. This effort
              will determine if an active catalyst can be provided by adding ionic iron by
              ion exchange into a low-cost feedstock followed by thermal treatment under a
              reducing gas. This process should produce a highly dispersed iron-carbon
              supported heterogeneous catalyst.         The proposed technology is designed
              to produce a low-cost, kinetically rapid, high-capacity heterogeneous catalyst
              for the remediation of chlorinated hydrocarbons. These properties mean that it
              can be used economically in barrier applications to remediate groundwater.
