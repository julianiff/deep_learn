Abstract    :
              ***  9661477  Pirzada      This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research
              project will investigate the synthesis and processing of nano-engineered
              materials for switching power supplies operating above 5 MHz. Conventional
              materials have excessive eddy current losses at frequencies above 1 to 5 MHz
              levels, making them unsuitable for higher frequency applications. Monodisperse,
              nano-engineered materials offer breakthrough potential in enabling very high
              frequency (1 GHz) operation while maintaining unavoidable eddy losses to an
              acceptable level. During Phase I, this research will show that commercially
              useful, nano-engineered materials for switching power supply applications can
              produced. Phase II effort will seek to optimize the process and produce
              prototype ferrite components. Phase III will commercialize the technology.   If
              successful, this research would help launch miniaturized switching power
              supplies. Proposed research would provide the material related breakthrough
              eagerly sought by high frequency power supplies market.  Potential specific
              customers include the electrical, electronic, and communication industries. 
              The technology will also be timely for the anticipated market trend towards
              miniaturization of multilayer chip inductors for SMD applications.  ***
