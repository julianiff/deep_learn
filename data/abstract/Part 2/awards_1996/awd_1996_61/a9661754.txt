Abstract    :
              ***  9661754  Mogee     In this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project, Mogee Research & Analysis Associates will apply co-citation analysis
              techniques developed in the field of bibliometrics to patent data in an effort
              to identify patents closely related in terms of subject matter that may
              represent valuable licensing packages.  Co-citation analysis techniques will be
              used to cluster the U.S. patents assigned to two companies in two different
              technologies based on citations they have received from U.S. patent examiners,
              European Patent Office examiners, and patent applicants.  The resulting patent
              clusters will be evaluated by licensing professionals to assess how the
              clustered patents relate to one another technologically and how valuable the
              clusters would be as licensing packages.  The co-citation clusters will also be
              compared to clusters generated using other standard search methods such as word
              searching and classification searching.  The goal of this research is to
              develop a tool that patent licensing professionals can use to group patents
              into valuable licensing packages more quickly, cheaply, and accurately than
              they can using current methods.   A primary commercial application of this
              research would be a software tool that could be licensed to companies or other
              organizations with large patent portfolios or to technology licensing
              companies.  This tool would help them identify potentially valuable clusters of
              patents within their patent portfolios and help them identify potential
              licensing partners.  ***
