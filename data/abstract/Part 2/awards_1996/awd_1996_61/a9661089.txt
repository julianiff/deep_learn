Abstract    :
              ***  96-61089  Kalkhoran    This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase
              I project will demonstrate large area cold cathode arrays for field emission
              displays based on gallium nitride/aluminum nitride (GaN-AlN) alloys grown in a
              low-temperature plasma-assisted, chemical vapor deposition and surface
              texturing facility.  With a bandgap of 6.2 electron volts, AIN may exhibit
              negative electron affinity, and thus electrons emanating from the high
              conductivity GaN contact will readily pass through the graded AI/Ga nitride
              region and be emitted into vacuum at low applied voltages.  GaN stripes
              deposited on glass or another substrate will form row electrodes, while indium
              tin oxide (ITO) stripes above the phosphor on the faceplate will serve as
              column electrodes.  Due to the expected negative electron affinity of AIN, no
              grid may be required.  This new cathode material can alleviate the present high
              voltage problems associated with high work-function metal "microtip" cathodes,
              as well as the lack of n-type conductivity in thin film diamond cathodes. 
              Coupled with on-going development of cathodoluminescent phosphors, the GaN/AlN
              cold cathode research will enable manufacture of flat panel displays under
              controlled conditions with cathode and phosphor components.  In Phase II, the
              GaN/AlN alloy cold cathodes would be optimized and used for lighting pixels on
              faceplates coated with cathodoluminescent phosphors, demonstrating an operating
              flat panel display.  Efficient cold cathode field emitters will find extensive
              commercial use in flat panel displays.  They can also be used in new
              sub-miniature vacuum tubes for ultra-high frequency applications, such as in
              communications systems.  ***
