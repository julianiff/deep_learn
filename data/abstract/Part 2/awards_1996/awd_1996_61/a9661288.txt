Abstract    :
                ***  9661288  Certain     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1
              project will investigate methods for multiresolution analysis of triangular
              meshes.  Complex meshes are rapidly becoming commonplace. They require large
              amounts of storage and are slow to transmit. Additionally,   they often contain
              more faces than can be interactively displayed on current hardware. 
              Multiresolution methods provide a theoretically sound, unified way to deal with
              complex meshes; however, many of the algorithms employed thus far do not
              exhibit the performance necessary for commercial applications. The goal of the
              project is to perform the experimental and theoretical research needed to
              overcome this problem.   This research has the potential to lead to a standard
              for the representation and transmission of complex meshes and will give a big
              boost to making shape photography  more commercially viable.  ***
