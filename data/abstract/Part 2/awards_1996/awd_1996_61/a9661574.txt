Abstract    :
              9661574  Behling  This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project is to
              transfer materials design 'know-how' which has been developed for the
              formulation and use of inks into the development of extruded, thermoplastic
              matrix composite tapes which can be used for widespread, innovative and
              cost-effective over voltage surge suppression applications. Oryx Technology has
              successfully developed such a material in the form of a conductor-filled,
              polymer matrix, thick film ink which can be applied to the fabrication of
              small, discrete device structures.  Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is a
              transient over-voltage event which poses a serious threat to integrated
              circuits (IC's) rendering them irreparably damaged due to the associated
              over-current flow through the circuit.  The standard means of contending with
              over-voltage threats is  to place a surge suppressor in parallel to the IC. 
              These suppressor types include diodes and varistors.  A need exists for a new
              generation suppressor concept which exhibits far lower leakage current and
              capacitance than existing devices.  These applications will include direct
              mounting of tapes onto printed circuit boards as well as the creation of
              on-leadframe and in-IC package placement.
