Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9661743  Manasson     This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project addresses a central problem of millimeter wave (MMW) imaging.
              MMW imaging is becoming an attractive option for remote sensing because
              millimeter waves have the advantage of penetrating adverse weather or other
              atmospheric obscurants, and to some extent because of MMW beams' ability to
              penetrate materials, while retaining reasonable spatial resolution. While a
              major goal of MMW imaging developers is to create an MMW equivalent of an IR
              staring array, the difficulties associated with providing the necessary MMW
              detector performance at an affordable price are immense. Use of a single, high
              quality MMW detector with a rapidly scanning low cost antenna can make a MMW
              imaging system more readily achievable. The proposed antenna concept uses an
              evanescent wave grating coupler to form a two-dimensional scanning antenna that
              can work at very high frame rates. The proposed research will demonstrate a
              proof-of-concept while advancing the understanding of the underlying physical
              phenomena. Phase II will result in fabrication of a prototype low-cost MMW
              radiometric imaging system.   MMW imaging systems are being considered for
              autonomous landing guidance for aircraft, automotive traffic monitoring, fire
              detection and other surveillance functions and for concealed weapons detection.
