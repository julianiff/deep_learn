              ***  ABSTRACT      9661134  Murphy     This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of using conducting polymers
              to fabricate bipolar plates for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. To
              make PEM fuel cell power sources for electric vehicles cost-competitive with
              competing technologies, materials cheaper than presently used carbon/resin
              composites for bipolar plates must be identified and more cost-effective
              methods of manufacturing these plates compared to high temperature
              graphitization of carbon/resin composites must be developed. The goal of this
              project is to take advantage of recently developed electronically conducting
              polymer technology for the development of superior and cost effective bipolar
              plates for PEM fuel cell stacks compared to the conventionally used graphitized
              carbon-based materials. The aim is to electrochemically synthesize net shape,
              high strength conducting polymer structures that exhibit high electronic
              conductivity at elevated temperatures in the presence of oxygen and that are
              not subject to oxidation/corrosion processes in oxygen-saturated acidic
              environments at elevated temperatures. The attractiveness of the approach is
              that it will allow the room temperature preparation of high strength, highly
              conducting polymer materials suitable for use not only as bipolar plates in PEM
              fuel cell stacks but also in other acid fuel cell systems, such as the
              phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC) system. Thus, developed technology arising
              from this project should be an enabling technology leading to the manufacture
              of low cost fuel cell stacks.   Low temperature methanol/air and hydrogen/air
              PEM fuel cells have considerable commercial potential as power sources for
              electric vehicles.  Other commercial applications include: electricity and heat
              production for residential and small commercial buildings; portable power
              sources for communications and news gathering equipment; portable medical
              instrumentation used by rescue teams; and external  electrical power sources
              for artificial heart and ventricular-assist devices. ***
