Abstract    :
                 This project will advance the ability of quantum chemistry calculations to
              predict many important chemical, biological, and materials processes involving
              transition metals. Currently, quantum chemistry software is hampered in this
              task by a poor integration of ligand field theory and other basic concepts of
              inorganic chemistry. In this SBIR project, Schrodinger, Inc. will improve its
              electronic structure software package, PS-GVB, to allow users to incorporate
              their chemical intuition about organometallic systems and to make automated,
              intelligent selections of electronic properties that are not userspecified. The
              software will account for the effects of ligand fields, oxidation states,
              formal charges on ligands, and intrinsic properties of metals, producing a
              high-quality trial wavefunction for ab initio or density functional theory
              (OFT) calculations.   In Phase II, Schrodinger, Inc. will make the technologies
              developed in Phase I available to non-expert users by incorporating the methods
              into an expert system graphical user interface. The software will allow the
              user full graphical control over the selection of specific electronic states of
              organometallic complexes. This flexibility will make electronic structure
              software widely useful for studies of molecular properties and excited states
              of systems containing transition metals.
