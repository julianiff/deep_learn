Abstract    :
              ***  96-61449  Rossin     This project investigates the development of a novel
              catalyst to control the emissions of volatile nitrogen-containing compounds
              (VNC's) without the generation of chemical NOx. VNC's are both hazardous and
              odorous, and therefore, their emissions must be controlled. Current
              technologies used to control VNC emissions result in the generation of
              significant amounts of NOx due to the atomic nitrogen associated with the VNC.
              The release of NOx into the atmosphere is a significant problem, since it has
              been linked to both smog and acid rain. Catalytic oxidation is a technology
              well suited for controlling vapor phase emissions. However, no catalyst is
              commercially available which is capable of destroying VNC's without the
              formation of NOx. A novel catalyst was recently identified which has
              demonstrated the ability to destroy hydrogen cyanide without forming NOx over a
              wide range of process conditions. The objective of this Phase I proposal is to
              modify this novel catalyst in order to enhance its reactivity and minimize its
              N20 selectivity. To meet this objective, developmental catalysts will be
              evaluated for nitrogen-product selectivity and performance stability over a
              range of process conditions.     Technologies capable of economically
              controlling the release of VNC's without the formation of NOx are currently
              unavailable.  Should the novel catalyst prove successful, economical pollution
              abatement systems may be designed around the catalyst to meet the needs of a
              wide variety of applications which include controlling plant fugitive emissions
              and fume abatement.  ***
