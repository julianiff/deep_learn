Abstract    :
              ***  9661637  Romero       In Phase I, TDA will fabricate dense, crack-free
              zeolite membranes supported on the interior of a porous alumina support tube.
              The increase in styrene production in a packed bed catalytic reactor, packed
              with a commercial iron oxide catalyst  will be demonstrated. The reaction will
              be conducted in a reactor with and without the zeolite membrane to quantify the
              improvement achieved with the membrane, and carry out an engineering analysis.
              In Phase II they plan to optimize the preparation of supported zeolite
              membranes, carry out a thorough investigation of the effects of temperature,
              pressure and steam dilution on mechanical stability and yield improvement,
              regeneration capability, and aging, and perform an extensive engineering
              analysis.     The commercialization of a zeolitic molecular sieve membrane
              reactor to shift the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to
              styrene towards the products could increase styrene yields, and decrease
              downstream separation costs in this high-volume production process.  This would
              result in a significant cost savings for the industry.  ***
