Abstract    :
              ***  9661615  ZHENG     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II is
              directed towards optical materials which contain a distributed refractive index
              and are used in lens design are called gradient-index (GRIN) materials which
              have wide applications in optical systems. In this proposed research, we plan
              to integrate the supercritical drying technique for the fabrication of axial
              GRIN glasses via the layering of sol-gel solutions, since this technique has
              been proven to be low cost and fast process. In addition, new glass
              compositions will be tested in order to achieve good chemical durability.   The
              principal application of this AGRIN lens is in various optical systems. The use
              of axial GRIN lenses can reduce one third of lenses. The proposed sol-gel
              layering technique is expected to be universal and promising way to make low
              cost and designable axial GRIN lenses in optical systems.    ***
