Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9661078  Bloomfield     This Small Business Innovation
              Research Phase I project will investigate the use of titanium nitride coated
              aluminum in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell bipolar plates as a
              replacement to the carbon and titanium bipolar plate parts currently in use.
              Simplified bipolar plate fabrication methods will also be examined during the
              course of this research effort. Although the power generation problems for PEM
              fuel cells have largely been solved, problems with weight and cost remain. One
              of the heaviest and costliest components in a fuel cell stack is the bipolar
              plate. During the Phase I program, Analytic Power will determine the
              feasibility of using titanium nitride coated low cost metals, the type(s) of
              plastic that can be used for seal frames, and whether or not the
              plastic-to-metal bond is adequate for use in pressurized fuel cells. The
              proposed materials and methods will be incorporated into the fabrication of
              fuel cell stacks and flow distribution, water management and sub-stack
              performance tests to evaluate the new materials and fabrication methods will be
              conducted.   Success in this program will lead to dramatic reductions in PEM
              fuel cell stack costs. This reduction in cost will bolster efforts underway to
              introduce PEM fuel cells into next generation vehicles. Cost reductions
              achieved by this research effort will also further the commercialization of PEM
              fuel cells as either stationary or portable power generation units. ***
