Abstract    :
              ***  96-61445  Wasson    This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will investigate an innovative new high-speed machining method that
              will more than double the speed capability to 100,000 revolutions per minute
              (rpm) and double the cutting power to 100 kilowatts (kW).  Machine tool
              spindles are key components in high-speed systems for machining aluminum,
              titanium, steel, and other metals.  State of the art spindles used to mill
              aluminum may achieve speeds of 50,000 rpm and cutting powers of 50 kW.  The new
              method is expected to increase substantially the removal rates of aluminum,
              titanium, steel, and other metals.    Commercial applications for this
              technology include the production of commercial aircraft and automotive
              components.  The new spindle technology could be directly integrated into
              commercial high-speed machining centers.  ***
