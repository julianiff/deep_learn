Abstract    :
              ***  9661483  Hwang     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will develop an efficient data structure for r-set solids that can then serve
              as the core to develop a compact, embeddable 3D geometric engine for
              applications such as 2D to 3D legacy engineering data conversion, feature
              interpretation, geometric reasoning, simulation based design, and medical
              systems modeling.  This research will contribute to the science and engineering
              base in the representation of non-manifold solids.  It will also provide a much
              needed toolkit for applications requiring embedded non-manifold solid model
              representation, manipulation, and reasoning.  Traditional manifold boundary
              representations cannot represent non-manifold solids which result naturally
              from some regularized union or difference operations between two manifold
              solids.  Manifold solids are not closed under fundamental solid modeling
              operations; r-set solids are.  Recent research in sufficient topological
              information requirements for r-set solids provide concrete design requirements
              for r-set boundary representations.  Advances in combinatorial analysis provide
              techniques to systematically identify an efficient data structure based on the
              design requirements.     Many CAD/CAE/CAM and Medical Imaging 3-D applications
              in industry and academic research need a compact, embeddable 3-D non-manifold
              geometry engine that current commercial solid modeling systems are not designed
              for.  The final product of this research targets that market.  ***
