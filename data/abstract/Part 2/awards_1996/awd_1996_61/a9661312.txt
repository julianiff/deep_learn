Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9661312  Kubachi     This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will investigate plasma polymerized materials based on
              organosilicon synthesis for producing a new class of low-k dielectrics. This
              all-plasma-deposited low-k dielectric could provide a strong competitive
              advantage in both cost and performance. The semiconductor industry's need for
              an insulating material with a low-k dielectric constant arises from the fact
              that chip speed is limited by the resistance of the metal line and the
              surrounding insulator. Dielectrics today have a constant of 4 to 3.2.  Higher
              chip speeds require a switch to a new type of material, very possibly a
              plastic-like organic. Such materials could reduce dielectric constants to 2.0
              or lower. The push for low-k dielectric materials is motivated by a desire to
              reduce capacitance. Reducing capacitance also minimizes crosstalk between
              adjacent metal lines, an increasingly severe problem.   The US market for low-k
              dielectrics is estimated to be 2 billion dollars by the year 2000. Low-k
              dielectrics are applicable to a broad spectrum of applications sensitive to
              ever finer geometries, crosstalk and higher frequencies. Prime candidates for a
              new class of low-k- materials are: IC manufacture to enable faster devices;
              high density MCMs with high density interconnects and less crosstalk for
              computers; and high frequency devices used in the telecommunications industry
              by allowing greater design latitutde and better performance on high frequency
              devices. ***
