Abstract    :
              ***  9661351  Kukreja     This project is concerned with a novel chemically
              heated catalytic converter to attain ultra-low emissions from vehicles.. The
              development of technology for meeting California Air Resources Board (CARB)
              Ultra-low-emission vehicle (ULEV) regulation has now become a main focus for
              vehicle manufacturers worldwide. Quick catalyst light-off temperature is a key
              part of being able to reduce HC and CO emissions. The use of an electrically
              heated catalytic (EHC) converter has been proposed to alleviate the problem,
              but the associated cost, and weight penalties are inadmissible.     The
              technical feasibility of a new scheme for heating a catalytic converter was
              demonstrated through preliminary experiments. The proposed process utilizes
              energy released from the flameless chemical reaction between certain organic
              compounds and oxygen from air. This approach based on chemically heating the
              catalytic (CHC) converter offers an economical, energy-efficient and cleaner
              way to reduce pollutant emissions during cold-start of the vehicle. The current
              proposal aims at developing the CHC converter by optimizing and assessing the
              effects of design and operating parameters influencing the performance of the
              catalytic converter. The Phase I research will culminate with a database needed
              for the design, development and implementation of CHC converter in Phase II.  .
