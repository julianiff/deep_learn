Abstract    :
              ***  96-61081  Bryan      This project addresses development of new materials
              for hydrogen-separation membranes.  The objective of Phase I is to demonstrate
              that a new group of metal alloys can be designed to deliver high hydrogen
              permeability at reduced cost via manipulation of the two factors that most
              strongly govern hydrogen permeability in palladium alloys the lattice spacing,
              and the favorable donation of electron density to the palladium 4d electron
              band. Candidate alloys will be fabricated and tested for cost-normalized
              hydrogen permeability. Phase I is expected to demonstrate the validity of this
              approach for developing new high-performance, low-cost hydrogen-permeable
              alloys.     Low-cost, high performance metal membranes will be practical for a
              broad range of applications that cannot be economically addressed with current
              metal membranes.  These applications include the heat-treating of metals,
              production of glass, hydrogenation of edible fats and oils, petroleum refining,
              olefins and aromatics manufacture, semiconductor manufacturer, and the
              development of hydrogen as an alternative fuel.  ***
