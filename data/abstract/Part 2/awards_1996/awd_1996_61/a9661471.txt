Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9661471  Kim     This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will develop a MEMS device for fast switching of high frequency
              signals such as RF. The mechanical switching will achieve virtually no
              parasitic leakage when the switch is off. The device will utilize a
              piezoelectric actuator which was originally developed for a display
              application.   The MEMS device developed will find application as a fast RF
              switching device in the field of microwave communications. ***
