Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      96-61691  Black      This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will develop a novel magnetic field sensor for in-situ process
              sensing. The system under investigation responds to the need for new techniques
              for real-time process control in semiconductor fabrication and Intelligent
              Fiber Optic Systems (IFOS) proposes to develop a room-temperature benchtop
              testbed comprising a magnetic orientation electromagnet and a portion of a
              semiconductor substrate chuck in conjunction with a magnetic sensor based on an
              innovative combination of technologies including fiber gratings and
              magnetostrictive coatings. During Phase I, IFOS will: (1) establish details of
              the sensor specifications, and design and model the sensor probes and system,
              (2) fabricate fiber sensor probe substrates involving fiber grating with
              claddings partially removed and coated by magnetostrictive material, (3)
              construct a feasibility prototype testbed, (4) test and evaluate prototype, and
              (5) deliver a final report and submit a Phase II proposal. This first-time
              incorporation of magnetic sensors in plasma Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) is
              expected to offer improved process control for thin film head fabrication with
              higher sensitivity and reliability than conventional approaches.   The
              electrically passive, in-line, multiplexible, low-cost, and mass producible
              sensor design developed during this research can be applied in in-situ process
              sensing and will find additional applications in the aerospace, electricity
              generation, and other industries. The aforementioned features make the proposed
              sensors marketable and will likely attract non-federal and private sector
              commercialization funding. ***
