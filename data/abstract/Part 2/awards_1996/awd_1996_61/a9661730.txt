Abstract    :
                 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is focused on
              enhancing performance of soil and ground water remediation systems at petroleum
              hydrocarbon impacted sites.  Presently accepted remediation technologies are
              ineffective, time consuming and expensive. As a result, the cost and resources
              needed to remediate impacted underground storage tank (UST) sites are
              prohibitive. Surfactant  enhanced subsurface remediation is proposed as an
              alternative remediation technology.  The goal of this research is to
              demonstrate the effectiveness of surfactant enhanced remediation technology and
              the technical feasibility of a pilot scale field application.  An economic
              analysis will be conducted and compared to existing technology.  Surfactants
              can increase the solubility and mobility of organic chemicals trapped in the
              subsurface, resulting in significantly increased removal efficiencies and
              reduced costs.  Although a number of laboratory studies and a few field studies
              have investigated surfactant enhanced remediation, a comprehensive field
              application has not yet been attempted.  Future utilization of this technology
              could result in significant savings in remediation costs for companies
              employing it.
