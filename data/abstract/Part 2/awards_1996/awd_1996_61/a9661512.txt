Abstract    :
              ***  9661512  Tang     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              investigates the feasibility of an approach that combines the operational
              profile, rare conditions, importance sampling, stress testing, and
              measurement-based dependability evaluation in the late testing phase or early
              operational phase, to quantify dependability for critical software that
              requires very high reliability (< 10-6) and availability (> 0.999999).
              Traditional software testing methods combined with reliability growth models
              cannot measure and assess dependability for software with such high
              requirements. The approach proposed for this research applies importance
              sampling, a statistical method to reduce sampling size while keeping estimates
              obtained from the sample unbiased at a high level of confidence, to the
              operational profile to guide testing critical operations or components of the
              software to accelerate the occurrence of rare conditions, then transforms the
              failure rates measured in the testing to those that occur in the normal
              operation by the likelihood ratio function of the importance sampling theory,
              and finally evaluates reliability and availability for the tested software
              system based on the transformed failure rates using measurement-based
              dependability modeling techniques. When the acceleration factor (likelihood
              ratio) is large (over 100), which is typical because the occurrence probability
              of rare conditions in the normal operation is much lower than in the importance
              sampling testing, it is possible to quantify a very high reliability or
              availability in a test of reasonable duration. It is anticipated that upon the
              completion of this research, a detailed methodology and a high level design of
              tools for implementing the proposed approach will be available.   Real-time
              commercial production systems that use software to monitor, control, and manage
              safety-critical equipment and physical processes (e.g., aircraft, nuclear and
              chemical plants) and similar critical systems developed by government  agencies
              (e.g., space shuttle and air traffic control system) require high reliability,
              availability, and safety. The approach and tools addressed in this research can
              be applied to the software in these systems to quantify dependability and to
              provide feedback to the design. The approach can also contribute significantly
              to enhancing the quality of the systems by applying its stress testing methods
              to the software.  ***
