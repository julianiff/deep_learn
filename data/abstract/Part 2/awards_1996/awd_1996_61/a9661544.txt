Abstract    :
              9661544  Speser  This Small Business innovation Research Phase I project to be
              carried out by Foresight Science and Technology, Incorporated builds a software
              engine providing decision support for the development of commercialization
              strategies. Commercialization strategy formulation can be viewed as a problem
              that involves a set of elements that mutually constrain each other.  Coherence
              is philosophical method for maximizing a set of positive and negative
              constraints.  As a coherence problem, commercialization strategy formulation
              requires discovering those strategies which best fit or cohere within a pattern
              involving (1) the technology being commercialized, (2) the internal company
              environment, (3) the external environment (especially the market), and, (4) the
              commercializing firm's goal(s), and which best leverage elements in the
              internal and external environments of the company and the technology, in order
              to attain company goals by exploiting opportunities and neutralizing or
              avoiding threats.  To build this tool, Foresight Science and Technology, Inc.
              will specify the elements in the knowledge domain based on relevant social
              scientific literature.  Research by Paul Thagard established that coherence can
              be computed via connectionist networks (neural nets) and Thagard's codes will
              be adapted for this project.  The project proffers a decision aid for
              commercialization in Small Business Innovation Research projects, federal labs,
              universities, and major corporations and an analytical tool to allow investors
              to access the commercialization strategies of companies with technology
              developments.
