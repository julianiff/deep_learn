Abstract    :
              9661246  Leaskey       This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              involves the processing of Si wafers for semiconductor applications to
              eliminate or reduce contamination by undesirable metal ions.  A major source of
              impurities has been identified as the wafer carriers used in the high
              temperature processing. Although carriers with high purity surfaces are
              available, with use the surface purity levels significantly decrease because:
              (1) higher purity CVD coatings spall and exposure lower purity bulk material
              and/or (2) contaminants in the bulk diffuse with time and temperature to the
              surface.  At wafer processing temperatures above ~1100 C, SiC-Si carriers are
              used.  The presence of Si increases the potential for contamination due to the
              high diffusion coefficients of many metal ions through Si, which are often many
              orders of magnitude greater than for SiC.  It would be desirable to replace the
              Si phase with a component through which ion mobility is decreased.  An
              innovative composite is proposed which has the potential for long-term use
              without contamination and improved mechanical properties. The components will
              be completely analyzed for relevant properties including purity and mechanical
              properties. Demonstration of fabrication of high quality components would lead
              to more extensive  analyses of prototype components to determine long term
              performance.       The main application would be as diffusion components to be
              used in semiconductor  processing.  The composites could also be fabricated
              with lower purity levels and used for applications requiring high temperature,
              corrosion resistant materials such as engine and heat exchanger components.
