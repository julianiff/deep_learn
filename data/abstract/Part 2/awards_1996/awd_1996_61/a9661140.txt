Abstract    :
              ***  9661140  Sudharsanan     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project proposes to develop a self-scanned, large-area, flat-panel, X-ray
              detector technology more efficient, lower-cost, and larger area than charged
              coupled device (CCD)-based X-ray detectors.  The proposed detector will employ
              a continuous photoconductive CdZnTe layer as a direct X-ray converter; this
              detector win be monolithically integrated to large-area, active-matrix,
              thin-film transistor pixellated arrays for readout. CdZnTe offers direct
              detection, better detection efficiency, higher signal-to-noise ratio, and
              larger dynamic range than CCD-based X-ray detectors. Phase I will seek to
              demonstrate the feasibility of this detector technology by fabricating and
              testing a detector array which employs CdZnTe thin films deposited on TFT
              arrays.  CdZnTe thin film will be deposited by thermal evaporation.  A 4 x 4
              array will be designed, fabricated, and tested to determine CdZnTe suitability
              for X-ray detection.   Phase II, would be directed toward fabricating larger
              arrays and performing imaging to demonstrate the feasibility of this detector
              technology for macromolecular crystallography.      If successful, the research
              could result in X-ray detector technology will replace CCD-based detector
              systems in X-ray diffraction studies of biological samples because of the
              direct detection, high detection efficiency, and low-cost of the technology. 
              In addition, these detectors will be useful for X-ray imaging in industrial and
              medical applications.  Medical applications include digital mammography and
              diagnostic X-ray radiology.  ***
