Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9661476  Castracane     This Small Business Innovation
              Research Phase I project will establish the feasibility of producing a
              micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) based, reconfigurable optical grating.
              This new device will form the heart of the next generation of compact
              spectroscopic instruments. Fundamental research into the operation of such MEMS
              devices is required to optimize their operation and enable widespread
              applications. Specifically, this Phase I effort will focus on perfecting a MEMS
              grating array whose ruling spacing can be reconfigured in real time to allow
              for rapid, full spectral analysis of several passbands critical for accurate
              laboratory and field-ready sensor systems. Objectives include production and
              packaging of several prototype micro-gratings and measurement of switching
              performance, optical efficiency and spectral resolution. Exploiting the
              expertise that InterScience has developed in both electro-optic technology and
              the MEMS field, the Phase I research effort will attempt to establish the
              operation of such a MEMS grating and develop a design for its integration into
              a compact, optical domain spectroscopic system. This Phase I project will
              combine material, mechanical and optical research and development and pave the
              way for full implementation in Phase II.   Commercial applications of the
              proposed research involve bringing fundamentally new spectroscopic instruments
              to market in areas such as atmospheric analysis, remote surveillance, and
              compact pressure and chemical sensing.  In addition, there exist medical
              applications for this new instrument in innovative cardiac treatment
              modalities.  ***
