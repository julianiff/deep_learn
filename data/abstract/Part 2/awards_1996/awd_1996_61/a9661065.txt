Abstract    :
              ***  9661065  Trnovsky     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will explore development of a novel, ultrasensitive in situ
              hybridization format for detecting single copy genes in whole cells or nuclei
              encapsulated in agarose microdrops.  A major goal of this research is to
              identify genes of interest present in a small fraction of the cell population
              without using target amplification.  For single copy gene detection, the
              technology to be developed will compete primarily with methods based on target
              amplification, such as PCR.  Although sensitive, these methods require release
              of target nucleic acids because purified templates are necessary for
              amplifications, making them unsuitable for cell-associated nucleic acid
              detection.  This method to be researched will utilize novel chemiluminescent
              substrates for horseradish peroxidase in combination with a cooled CCD camera
              for detecting low light levels.  Because no isolation of DNA is needed for in
              situ hybridizations, high signal densities are expected to permit detection of
              low DNA copy numbers at different cellular locations.  The method can be used
              for identifying genes transferred to cellular genomes by in vitro
              (transfection, gene therapies) or in vivo (viral infections, transposition)
              methods and determining the percentage of cells containing transferred  genes. 
               Development of high sensitivity assay formats for detecting minute amounts of
              DNA for genomics research and molecular cytometics will contribute to
              development of economically important materials.  ***
