Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      96-61638  Gabl      This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I program will develop a compact, reliable, terahertz (THz) time-domain
              spectrometer. This instrument will be used to provide comprehensive
              far-infrared absorption measurement. THz time-domain spectroscopy is
              conceptually a very general technique. However, until now, the complexity of
              the required femtosecond source has severely limited the diffusion of this
              spectroscopic technique. This Phase I program addresses this main issue. During
              our Phase I we will demonstrate a prototype THz spectrometer operating with one
              of our compact femtosecond source. In our Phase II we will developed a
              field-portable Terahertz time-domain spectrometer. The proposed THz time-domain
              spectrometer will use a compact femtosecond laser to gate a coherent receiver.
              This approach offers superb signal to noise ratios (108:1 in power). The
              coverage of this spectrometer will extend continuously over a wide spectral
              range, from 0.1 to greater than 6 THz, permitting the simultaneous detection of
              many species. This THz source generates a well-collimated, low-divergence beam
              for which the receiver has a corresponding small acceptance angle. Thus, the
              proposed technique combined with mathematical techniques commonly used in
              tomography should provide 3-D data. Our program goals will be reached in
              collaboration with the inventor of THz time-domain spectroscopy, Professor D.
              Grischkowsky (Oklahoma State University).   THz time-domain spectroscopy has
              applications in non-contact measurement of water vapor, non-contact measurement
              of doping levels in semi-conductor wafers, non-contact monitoring of flame
              emission and flame temperature, and detection of concealed explosives. ***
