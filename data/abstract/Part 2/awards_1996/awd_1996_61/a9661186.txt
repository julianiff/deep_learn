Abstract    :
              ***  9661186  Read      This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project
              will develop novel microwave absorbing materials that effectively absorb
              microwave radiation over wide ranges of frequency (typically an octave). The
              absorbers are based on materials that have dielectric properties that are
              functions of frequency in such a mariner as to create strong, wideband
              absorption from a fixed thickness of material. The typical thicknesses are
              appropriate for cast, flexible sheets and bulk forms, and compositions with
              higher dielectric constant suitable for paints are also possible. The microwave
              loss and the majority of the real part of the dielectric constant in these
              materials result from a strong, non-exponential dielectric relaxation
              associated with the micro-geometry of  a tailored ceramic-conductor composite.
              The frequency response of the absorbers is adjustable by chemical means during
              the processing of the composite. Test samples of these materials will be
              synthesized and the favorable frequency response and tunability will be
              demonstrated experimentally.    Potential applications include the suppression
              of spurious emissions and interference from consumer communications and
              computer equipment, and suppression of oscillations in microwave power tubes,
              and passive microwave strip line components. If very thin materials can be
              developed, there are additional applications in military systems.  ***
