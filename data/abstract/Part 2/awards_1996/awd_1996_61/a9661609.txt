Abstract    :
              ***  96-61609  Shleser     This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase
              I project focuses on genetic   improvement of the black tiger shrimp, Penaeus
              monodon.  This species represents   75% of the world production of farmed
              shrimp, valued at more than 3 billion dollars per   year.  Selective breeding
              of this shrimp for performance in a farming environment is   expected to
              improve profitability.  Phase I will produce genetically identifiable Specific 
               Pathogen Free P. monodon stocks, that can be selectively bred for improved
              farming   performance.  Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of
              introns in conserved   nuclear genes using universal PCR primers will be
              applied to differentiate individuals of   closely related populations of marine
              shrimp.  This method will be used to evaluate   captive populations of
              P.monodon to identify family lines for the breeding program.    The commercial
              application is in a genetically improved broodstock and post larvae for  
              export of shrimp throughout the world.  ***
