Abstract    :
              ***  9661382  Kogan      This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              offers a new information strategy for addressing the need for quality and
              efficiency in the health care industry.  Using Internet tools and techniques,
              CK Software, Inc. will develop a Protocol Engine to provide nurses and
              physicians with access to health care rules and guidelines at the time of
              treatment, when these are most effective in improving quality and cost
              effectiveness of health care.  During Phase I, the Protocol Engine will be
              prototyped as a Web-Server application.  Tools and techniques of accessing
              current data on mainframe and mini computers will be investigated.
              Server/browser notification techniques will be developed so that users can be
              informed of the actions they need to take.  Processes for integrating standard
              Lab and Chart notes applications will be demonstrated to take full advantage of
              the network and Web-Server environment and to display the full power of this
              approach for future customers.     The fully functional Protocol Engine which
              CK Software, Inc. intends to develop in the second phase of the project will be
              a valuable tool for insurers, government agencies, health management
              organizations, clinics, and payors of all types that are pressing to limit
              costs and improve quality by standardization and managed care.  ***
