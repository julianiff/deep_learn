Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9661440  Prohaska     This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will develop a low-cost, on-line, integrated multiple-parameter
              gas sensor for reformer and fuel-cell-powered electric engine control with the
              aim of optimizing engine safety and efficiency. Initially, the
              multiple-parameter gas sensors are proposed for engines operating on a methanol
              reformate. Where H2, CO, methanol and other electrochemically oxidizable or
              reducible gases are present, the sensor design and measurement concept will
              also be applicable to engines which operate on distillate fuels or natural gas
              to power hybrid electric vehicles or building and utility equipment.
              Feasibility of the miniaturized sensor design and monitoring concept will be
              demonstrated during Phase I for hydrogen, methanol and carbon monoxide
              concentration measurements in the fuel stream. The electrochemical cell will be
              based on Giner's membrane electrode assembly techniques, using polymer
              electrolytes in combination with thick-film electrodes. During Phase I,
              collaboration with industry and research laboratories actually involved in
              reformer and fuel cell development will be sought in preparation for the Phase
              II product development program and for funding of Phase III product engineering
              and manufacturing transfer.   The anticipated products resulting from this
              project are reliable, robust, stable, and inexpensive electrochemical gas
              sensors for use in fuel-cell-powered electric engines.  Reformer efficiency
              control, fuel cell poison protection, and emission monitoring will be the main
              applications of these devices.  A multimillion-dollar market is expected from
              this market segment.  It is envisioned that these devices may also have broad
              application in environmental monitoring and industrial process control. ***
