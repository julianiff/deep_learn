Abstract    :
              ***  9661410  Prohaska      This project will evaluate the feasibility of a
              miniaturized ozone sensor for the resolution of parts per billion (ppb)
              concentration changes in the atmosphere. The proposal is based on a recent
              breakthrough which utilizes established sensor technology in combination with
              solid-state mass production techniques to form low-cost miniaturized sensors
              with superior measurement capabilities. The development of this high-resolution
              device will require detailed understanding of sensing materials, measurement
              and fabrication processes, as well as possible causes for signal distortions.
              The proposed Phase I studies are designed to provide necessary information and
              data for a successful Phase II development.   During Phase II it is planned to
              integrate the ozone sensor with other miniaturized toxic gas sensors, ie. for
              nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide, onto highly selective, low-cost, low-energy
              consuming, light weight, multiple sensor devices for environmental monitoring.
              Phase II product development is planned to be performed together with corporate
              partners who are established in the environmental and safety market, and will
              support the Phase III product engineering and manufacturing transfer.  ***
