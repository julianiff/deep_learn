Abstract    :
              ***  96-61267  Ji      . This proposal addresses development of cost-effective,
              highly selective, high-pressure, and high-temperature gas separation modules by
              use of low-cost, highly compact ceramic ultrafiltration (UF) modules as gas
              separation membrane supports. The active separation layer will be a thin
              ceramic membrane with pore size of 4- 10 nm modified with silver or copper ions
              and sealed with a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) thin film.. During Phase I,
              novel facilitated transport organic-inorganic membranes will be developed. High
              selectivity of these membranes for olefin/paraffin separation will be
              demonstrated. A reservoir method will be employed to modify the top thin
              membrane of a ceramic module with silver or copper ions.  An innovative method
              will be used to apply a thin PDMS film to the modified ceramic membrane to form
              a dense separation layer. These membranes will be tested at temperatures
              ranging from 25 to 200  C for separation of olefin/paraffin mixtures at a
              laboratory scale.      The novel high-pressure and high-temperature facilitated
              transport membrane modules to be developed  in this program, if successfully
              scaled up to production-scale ceramic modules (as envisioned for Phase II
              work), would be a key element in the separation of olefin/paraffin mixture in
              the chemical and petrochemical industry.  They could also be used to
              effectively separate carbon monoxide from a synthesis gas.  ***
