Abstract    :
              ***  96-61340  Micheels     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
              I Project will develop a novel portable and low cost nitrogen dioxide gas
              monitor for air quality testing and leak detection.  The monitor is based on
              photo-acoustic detection and incorporates recent advances in electro-optics to
              provide a practical, high sensitivity, portable detection device.  This
              nitrogen dioxide gas sensor is expected to have much improved detection
              sensitivity, shorter response time, lower maintenance, and little or no
              chemical interference.  Phase I will build a prototype instrument and subject
              it to critical tests to evaluate its performance for trace atmospheric nitrogen
              dioxide monitoring.    Such monitoring is of great importance in urban areas
              where nitrogen dioxide produced from fossil fuel combustion results in serious
              human health hazards.  This high sensitivity, portable monitor will find
              commercial applications: a) in air quality monitoring in urban areas that have
              air pollution problems, and b) in leak detection and industrial hygiene in
              chemical process plants that use or produce nitrogen dioxide in their
              operations.  ***
