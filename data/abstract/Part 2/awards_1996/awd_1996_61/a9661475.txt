Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9661475  Kostrzewski     This Small Business Innovation
              Research Phase I project will develop a unique anticounterfeiting method based
              on optical correlation techniques whose large number of degrees of freedom will
              ensure extremely high confidence. The proposed methodology uses high density
              phase encoded labels with 10^30 code possibilities and is an extension of
              existing optical correlation technology for label verification. Using phase
              encoding for label verification poses a significant challenge because labels
              may be presented for verification with unpredictable scale, shift, and
              rotation. During Phase I, research will be conducted to develop scale,
              translation, and rotation invariant phase codes together with a flexible
              reading/processing head that will allow unrestricted placement of labels during
              the verification process. Scanning or replicating of phase labels will be
              impossible because of the high optical density of the phase information. An
              additional feature of the proposed phase encoded labeling is its compatibility
              with a variety of substrates, including thin foil and plastic in both
              reflection and transmission modes of operation.   Research conducted during
              Phase I will develop a new tool to fight counterfeit crime. Phase encoded
              labeling can applied to many security applications like limited access
              security, ID cards, credit card verification, product label verification
              systems, and medical records. The production cost of such labels will be in the
              range of just a few cents per label. ***
