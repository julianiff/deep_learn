Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9661263  Debs     This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will complete the research required to introduce some basic new
              functionality to the EPRI Operator Training Simulator (OTS) to meet the needs
              of deregulated (restructured) electric utilities. A key element here is to
              upgrade the EPRI-OTS to become an effective tool for training the ISO
              (Independent System Operators) dispatchers for system operation. ISO engineers
              and management staff will be able to use the enhanced product for operation
              planning and other studies. The main objective of this work will be to
              integrate new models and programs into the EPRI-OTS consisting of: (1) a novel
              Multi-Area Optimal Power Flow; (2) simultaneous transfer capability
              coordination program; and (3) measurement and evaluation of ancillary services
              program. Other objectives relate to testing and evaluation of these programs
              and the preparation of a Phase II plan. The result of the Phase I research will
              be a demonstrable product which will clearly differentiate itself in the arena
              of Operator Training Simulators for the deregulated electric utility.   It is
              expected that the OTS developed during this research will be implemented at
              most major electric utilities--including an estimated 100+ United States and
              50+ international utilities who need the results of the proposed research and
              development. ***
