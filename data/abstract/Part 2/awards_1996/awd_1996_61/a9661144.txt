Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9661144  Chen      This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will develop a two part nonvolatile RAM. This memory device
              will be fabricated as two separate components which will then be electrically
              connected together. A "circuit component", consisting of MOS technology similar
              to DRAM without storage capacitors, would incorporate address selection and
              data input/output. A second "storage medium" component would house
              ferroelectric capacitors, which would actually store information. By producing
              these two parts separately, adverse mutual effects which occur during the
              fabrication process can be avoided, and the characteristics of both parts can
              be optimized. A novel approach to micro-mechanical joining will be used to
              connect each capacitor in the storage medium component to a corresponding MOS
              drain electrode in the circuitry component. The storage medium component is
              simply an unpatterned ferroelectric film deposited on a common, metallic ground
              plane. The ferroelectric storage capacitors are defined by the other electrode
              on the circuitry component. Because of this simple structure, no alignment is
              necessary, making for simpler connection of the two parts.   This nonvolatile
              RAM has immediate advantages over other nonvolatile memories because it
              possesses true random access (bit-by-bit reading and writing), simple
              construction leading to low cost, and a rugged design (no moving parts).
              Moreover, it can be packaged as a "smart card" holding as much data as a CD.
              Due to the nonvolatility of this new technology, computers would experience no
              data loss on power loss, would have no boot-up time, and would not need a hard
              disk. This technology may be also able to compete against DRAMs. ***
