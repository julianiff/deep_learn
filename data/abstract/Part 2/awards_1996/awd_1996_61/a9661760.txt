Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9661760  Pien     This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will investigate a novel approach for preparing Pt
              electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Platinum
              clusters will be impregnated inside carbonaceous structures protecting the
              active sites from poisonous gases such as CO, CO2, etc. At least two different
              impregnation techniques will be tested in Phase I including CVD deposition
              technique and impregnation from liquid phase. The carbonaceous materials will
              be chemically treated prior to impregnation by using oxidative treatment
              procedure. Prepared catalysts will be evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, X-ray
              spectroscopy, AUGER spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The catalyst
              performance will be evaluated in a single fuel cell with 5 cm2 active area.
              Hydrogen and hydrogen with premixed CO will be used as reactant gases. A
              comparison between conventional Pt/Ru catalyst and the novel catalyst developed
              during Phase I will be performed.   The catalyst developed during the proposed
              research program will have commercial applications in PEM fuel cells for
              transportation applications as well as for stationary fuel cell power systems
              operating on reformate gas and methanol. ***
