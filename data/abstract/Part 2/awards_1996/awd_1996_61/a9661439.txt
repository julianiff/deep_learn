Abstract    :
              ***  9661439  Guire      This project is designed to demonstrate the feasibility
              of a generally applicable, facile, and cost-effective approach to coating of
              plastic materials used in specific binding assay and biosensor systems.
              Covalent passivation of the surface with a biomolecule-compatible stabilizing
              agent, patterned immobilization of biomolecules, which are critical and
              enduring obstacles to the commercial development of biosensor technology, will
              be resolved through the preparation of a photoreactive "universal binding" thin
              film surface. Covalent photochemical bonding of the high affinity general
              ligand (biotin) derivative and of the passivating/stabilizing agent, will be
              accomplished quickly under mild reaction conditions by patterned and uniform
              illumination, respectively. A patterned array of X-avidin immobilized on
              passivated optical grade plastic will be obtained by dip-coating this surface
              with a crude or purified solution of this multi-site binding protein, then
              prepared for multianalyte assay use with essentially any nucleic acid probes or
              specific analyte binding proteins (e.g., antibodies) assay through differential
              loading of the individual assay dots of the array by inkjet printing (e.g.,
              with the desired biotinylated oligonucleotides for cystic fibrosis gene
              defects).   This approach is expected to provide cost-effective solutions to
              the outstanding technical problems of the biomolecule-sensor interface of small
              sample, sensitive , multiananyte, rugged portable commercial devices under
              development for nucleic acid probe and immune assays of value for
              environmental, food, infectious disease, and gene sequence analysis and
              monitoring.  ***
