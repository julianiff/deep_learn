Abstract    :
              ***  9661545  Pinnau     This project addresses the development of a new class
              of gas separation membranes based on superglassy polymers. Superglassy polymers
              are characterized by high glass transition temperatures, high free volume,
              large intermolecular chain spacing, connectivity of free volume elements,
              extremely high hydrocarbon permeability and high hydrocarbon/permanent-gas
              selectivity. it was recently discovered that poly(1-trimethylsilyl-1-propyne) 
              PTMSP , the only superglassy polymer studied to date, can show a mixed-gas
              selectivity of 30 for e-butane over methane, the highest selectivity ever
              observed for this important mixture. However, the potential use of PTMSP
              membranes is limited because its chemical resistance to higher hydrocarbons and
              aromatic hydrocarbons is poor. The project goal is to develop novel, chemically
              resistant superglassy polymer membranes based on disubstituted polyacetylenes.
              Preliminary pure-gas permeation studies with one such polymer show that its
              permeability and selectivity for the e-butane/methane mixtures separation are
              lower than those of PTMSP, but high enough to be promising. Unlike PTMSP, the
              polymer is completely stable in an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon
              environment. It is believed that the permeability and selectivity of the
              polymer can be increased by proper structural modifications.     Membranes make
              from superglassy polymers could have a significant impact on many important
              industrial vapor separations.  Possible applications include recovery of C3+
              hydrocarbons from hydrogen in the petrochemical industry.  The superior
              selectivity and permeability of superglassy polymers relative to
              state-of-the-art rubbery membranes should make membrane systems competitive
              with conventional separation methods such as cryogenic separation in these or
              other applications.  ***
