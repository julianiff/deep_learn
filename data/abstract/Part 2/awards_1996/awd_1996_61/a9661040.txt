Abstract    :
              ***  ABSTRACT      9661040  Choudhary     This Small Business Innovation
              Research Phase I project will investigate the use of conductive perovskite-type
              oxide coatings on aluminum sheets and plates for potential application in
              low-temperature fuel cell stacks. The cost of low-temperature fuel cell stacks
              can be greatly reduced if the bipolar graphite plates, which are used to
              connect the fuel cells in series, can be replaced by aluminum plates with
              conductive and corrosion resistant coatings. The conductive oxide coatings
              under investigation in Phase I will be deposited on aluminum alloy substrates,
              coated with Ni/Cu bilayers, by low-temperature organometallic chemical vapor
              deposition (OMCVD). The multilayer thin film deposition scheme has been
              designed to reduce thermal stresses in the films. The coatings will be
              characterized by X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy and scanning electron
              microscopy. The corrosion resistance of the conductive oxide protective
              coatings will be determined by acetic acid salt spray test. During Phase I, the
              conductive, perovskite-type oxide coatings will be synthesized at low
              temperatures (< 325 C) by OMCVD using organometallic precursors and N2O (an
              oxidizer).   The aluminum sheets and plates coated with conductive
              perovskite-type oxide thin films will be used in low-temperature (87-125 C)
              fuel cell stacks. The conductive oxide coatings are expected to provide
              long-term corrosion resistance. The fuel cell stacks with conductive oxide
              coated aluminum sheets and plates will have potential application in the next
              generation automobiles, buses, watercraft and submarines. The conductive oxide
              protective coatings can also be applied to aluminum parts for non-decorative
              applications. ***
