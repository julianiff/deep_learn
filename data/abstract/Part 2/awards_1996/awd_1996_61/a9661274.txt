Abstract    :
              9661274  Leone  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project to be
              carried out by Analysis and Simulation, Inc.(AnSim) proposes to develop a
              Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) system to support collaborative learning and
              case-study instruction in the sciences and mathematics.  The environment is a
              windows-based implementation of the table top shared by the group during
              face-to-face meetings.  It would support real-time interaction between groups
              of students, with or without their instructor, allowing verbal and graphical
              interchanges, via chat channels and graphics whiteboard and web browser.  The
              system integrates a unique search facility, Human Memory Extension (HME), and
              analytical engine to support the group's case study research efforts.  The VLE
              extends the groups capacity to hold meetings and share retrieved research data
              while working on a case study thereby having a synergistic effect on the
              group's cohesiveness.  The complete VLE supports a group-learning/case-based
              studies approach to learning and should be of general interest to college
              educators in the sciences, engineering and mathematics.  The VLE design is
              modular and capable of spin-off products: (1) the HME search facility could
              assist students to make their information retrieval from digital sources be
              more efficient; (2) the virtual meeting room with chat facility and white board
              would give teachers the ability in effect to meet with students outside the
              class room.  High schools educators may choose to focus more on the HME search
              facility for use with their growing digital libraries.
