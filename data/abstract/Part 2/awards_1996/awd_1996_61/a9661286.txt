Abstract    :
              ***  96-61286  Cobern     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will develop novel, low-cost, compact, wide-range humidity sensors. 
              These sensors employ a unique molecular electronic technology, originally
              developed for geophysical sensors.  In this application, a polymer-metal
              compound is used to adsorb and dissociate water molecules, thereby creating a
              conductive path through the polymer film.  The change in conductivity is
              measured and will be used to determine water vapor concentration.  Since no
              molecular water is retained in the sensor, it is impervious to changes due to
              freezing.  They will have excellent repeatability and linearity and ultralow
              hysteresis.  They are expected to be rugged, contamination- and
              condensate-resistant, and produced by standard thin-film technology.  Phase I
              will determine the feasibility of these sensors and to prepare prototypes for
              field testing.    These sensors will be used in various branches of atmospheric
              and environmental sciences to provide wide range three-dimensional monitoring. 
              Their low cost, small size, and high performance will also make them useful in
              many industrial and commercial applications.  ***
