Abstract    :
              ***  9661652  Banet     This Small Business Phase I project will provide an
              improved process-control instrument for increasing yields and identifying
              defective product in microelectronic device fabrication.  The proposed
              instrument will monitor fabrication processes performed in multi-chamber
              environments that are rapidly becoming the standard in microelectronics
              fabrication.  Multi-chamber platforms include a central wafer-handling housing
              connected at it facets to different fabrication tools (e.g., CVD and etching
              chambers); the housing and the connected tools are kept under vacuum.  A single
              platform performs multiple process steps.  Unfortunately, the same features
              that make the platforms advantageous also make it difficult to perform process
              control,  For example, most conventional metrology tools cannot measure wafers
              within the platform. To meet the fabrication industry's demand for real-time
              process control instrument s, it is proposed to develop and test an
              all-optical, smallscale process-control instrument.  This instrument will
              remotely determine: i) the thickness of opaque (e.g., metal) and transparent
              (e,g., oxide) films; ii) adhesion vs. delamination of opaque and transparent
              films; iii) viscoelastic properties of films and substrates; iv) thermal
              diffusivity of films and substrates; and v) ion implant levels of silicon
              wafers and epitaxially grown films.   The proposed instrument has applications
              in the microelectronics industry, particularly in the area of metrology and
              process control.  ***
