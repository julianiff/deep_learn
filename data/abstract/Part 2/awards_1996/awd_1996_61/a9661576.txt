Abstract    :
                ***  9661576  DeMenthon     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will test a novel instrument for tracking the hand and the head of a
              subject, and has particular application to user-system interfaces for
              interactive 3D graphics and virtual reality.  A novel optical tracker using
              infrared Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) mounted on the hand and head of the user
              and a fixed camera equipped with a position sensing diode (PSD) will be
              developed. The system will modulate each LED at a distinct characteristic
              frequency from several kHz to several hundred kHz. The contributions from the
              LEDs to the PSD signal will all be measured simultaneously and separated by
              digital filters, each tuned to extract the contribution of a single LED.
              Sunlight and incandescent light sources do not produce components in the kHz
              range and will be rejected by high pass filters. This design will obtain
              accurate translation and rotation measurements at high rate, and with a low
              phase lag during rapid hand or head motion.    The proposed technology will
              result in the development of optical tracking systems which perform reliably in
              unconstrained lighting environments, while providing high update rates and high
              responsiveness.  Potential commercial applications include 3D mouse systems and
              Head Mounted Display trackers for the interactive 3D graphics market, the
              simulator market, and the entertainment market.  ***
