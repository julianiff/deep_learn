Abstract    :
              Faculty  from three departments  (Mathematics,  Biology,  Physical  Science) 
              prepared this group proposal.  Its goal is to enhance understanding  of
              mathematics, science, and their interactions and relevance to  students. 
              Objectives are to increase scientific literacy, student  awareness  of 
              connections  between  mathematics  and  science,  critical  thinking and
              problem solving skills, and ability of future teachers  to incorporate math
              into their classrooms.   This proposal will  develop a multidisciplinary,
              general education level quantitative reasoning course that will use basic
              algebra to answer science questions.      Students completing this course
              should have better problem  solving skills and exhibit a greater level of
              scientific literacy.  Assessment will include comparison of students in newly
              developed  and preexisting courses through value-added testing, performance on 
              standardized tests,  and tracking student success in subsequent  courses. 
              Dissemination may include presentations, publications,  and a Web page.  This
              project will encourage minority participation  in math and science. 
              Approximately 30% of the students at SOSU are  Native American and less than
              20% major in mathematics or science.
