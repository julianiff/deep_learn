Abstract    :
              This work will produce a greatly needed, major revision of the first sequence in
              Computer Science. Business and industry are not satisfied with the current
              graduates of Computer Science Programs. They need graduates who are 1) fully
              capable of working in teams, 2) understand problem solving and how the solution
              fits into the environment of the organization, and 3) possess a thorough
              understanding of object-oriented analysis, design and implementation. In order
              to prepare students to meet these requirements we propose to have them begin in
              the very first course to work together in teams, to look at realistic problems,
              and develop top-down problem solutions.     To implement this solution the
              current bottom-up orientation of the beginning sequence will be replaced by a
              top-down approach. Students will be introduced to problem solving with objects
              which are available to them. Only later will they learn to modify and still
              later to create their own objects. Currently students spend most of their
              initial course on the syntax and semantics of the language they are using to
              implement the solutions to algorithms they develop. Most of their time is
              consumed in developing a fluency in a particular language.  We propose a true
              top down, object-oriented, collaborative approach for students in the first
              course. We will develop a library of objects, detailed notes for students, and
              laboratory exercises to support this top down, active, collaborative learning.
