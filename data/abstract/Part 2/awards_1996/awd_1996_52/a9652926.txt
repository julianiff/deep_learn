Abstract    :
                   A virtual-reality laboratory for engineering education will be estab- 
              lished at North Carolina State University that takes advantage of recent 
              dramatic reductions in the cost of virtual-reality technology.  A unique aspect
              of the project is the use of haptic devices that incorporate tactile
              stimulation into more traditional multimedia tools.  The laboratory, which will
              be associated with the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, will be
              used by undergraduates to interactively explore complex materials-related
              topics like the range and strength of chemical forces. The educational software
              will be developed at NCSU in collaboration with the NIH National Center for
              Research Resources at UNC-Chapel Hill.
