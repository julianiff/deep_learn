Abstract    :
                   The objective of this proposal is create a national pilot program for
              encouraging engineering students to enter the teaching profession as teachers
              of science and mathematics in secondary schools.     We will plan for and
              implement a year-long program for senior engineering students that will include
              experiences in pedagogy, teaching techniques, and field trips to classrooms. A
              major part of the year-long workshop will be advice and counseling on career
              development. Options for certification will be discussed.     The program
              faculty for this project include an engineering professor interested in
              education, a mathematician teaching student teachers, a director of a Master of
              Arts in Teaching program and a public school teacher.  The program will be
              professionally evaluated and feedback from students will be an important
              component of this evaluation     An information kit will be prepared and a
              video presentation will be made of the experiences and this will be sent to all
              interested engineering schools.     Following the first year, the program at
              Duke University will be self sustaining and will become a permanent part of the
              School of Engineering curriculum.
