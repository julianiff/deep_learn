Abstract    :
              9652656  Urban    Interactions   among  physical  site  features,   biological 
              processes,  and  human influences confound  our  ability  to  predict 
              ecosystem response to environmental change. Because  of  these complications,
              correlational approaches to  impact  assessment may be irrelevant at the time
              scales required for  resource   management  and  mitigation.  This   study  
              will  elucidate the mechanisms of forest response to environmental 
              constraints,  and  scale  these  responses  from  stands  to  landscapes. 
              Field  studies  will  be  conducted  for   four  contrasting  regions:  the 
              Pacific  Northwest,  the  Sierra  Nevada,  the  Northeast, and the Southeast.
              We will  explore  the  sensitivity  of these forests to simulated  changes  in 
              climate  using stand- and landscape-scale models.  A  common  modeling
              framework will be used across all sites to  provide  an  explicit, structured
              method for assessing differences in  forest response among sites. The results
              of this study  will  provide  new  site-  and regional-scale  insights  into 
              the  environmental  control  of  transient  forest  responses  to  climatic
              change.
