Abstract    :
              This project reforms first-year computer science and computer engineering
              curricula by implementing a common integrated freshman core curriculum. This
              integrated curriculum involves coordination of content and assignments for its
              courses. We utilize "just-in-time" instruction, where topics are introduced in
              given courses at precisely the appropriate time for those topics to be applied
              in other (concurrent) courses. Our efforts involve the integration of three
              one-year course sequences: a hardware sequence, a software sequence, and a
              mathematics sequence.
