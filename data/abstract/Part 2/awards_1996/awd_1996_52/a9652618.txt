Abstract    :
              9652618   Harmon    Carbon Accumulation, Storage, and Release by Woody Detritus
              in the Forests of Russia    Recent analyses of the global carbon cycle indicate
              that a major pathway for removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere must
              exist in the Northern Hemisphere.  A major unknown for this removal term is the
              amount being removed by the forests of Russia which comprise over 50% of boreal
              forests worldwide.  This project addresses this major unknown in the global
              carbon budget.  Two interrelated studies will be carried out.  The first study
              quantifies and summarizes the woody biomass of these forests throughout Russia
              using an extensive existing data base.  The second study measures the rates of
              woody detritus decomposition in these forests.  The research assesses the size
              and flux of carbon in a major forest region of the world.  These data will help
              reduce the uncertainty in a major component of the global carbon budget.
