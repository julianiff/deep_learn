Abstract    :
                Any IBM clone PC having a printer port may be used to interfaced with all
              manner of interesting real world devices which have meaning to students. There
              are millions of such PC's in colleges and universities, in high schools and in
              the hands of individuals throughout the country.    This project will develop
              material to show students at Morgan State University and across the nation how
              to use this resource to give relevance to programming and to encourage
              individual "tinkering" and experimenting by students.    The project will
              develop material related to the computer control of real world peripherals for
              use by students throughout the nation. This will be distributed using the World
              Wide Web and in the form of tutorial manuals.    New material will be developed
              to teach freshmen engineering majors programming skills in an environment of
              controlling lamps, solenoids, motors and measuring such parameters as infrared
              and temperature.  Applications of these real world peripherals to such fields
              as manufacturing, robotics and automation will also be woven into the project. 
                The possibility of moving this meaningful application of programming outside
              the University and into high schools will be explored.
