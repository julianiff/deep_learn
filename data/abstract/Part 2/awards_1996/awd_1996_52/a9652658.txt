Abstract    :
              9652658  Jones    Effects of Defoliation on Isoprene Emissions from Oaks    
              Isoprene emitted by plants is the single most important naturally occurring
              volatile organic compound in the lower atmosphere, because it is a major
              control on atmospheric concentrations of carbon monoxide, ozone and methane. 
              Understanding what controls isoprene emissions from plants is critical for
              improving models of atmospheric chemistry that are used in studying global
              climate change.  This project explores a new, potentially major control over
              isoprene emissions from plants.  Preliminary studies showed that partial
              defoliation of oaks resulted in an unexpected increase in isoprene emissions
              from remaining leaves.  Oaks are the major isoprene-emitters in the eastern
              U.S., and are   periodically subjected to massive, wide-scale defoliation by an
              introduced forest insect pest, the Gypsy Moth.  This project will study the
              effects of defoliation on isoprene emissions from oaks, using the information
              to improve existing models that predict isoprene emissions from plants.
