Abstract    :
               Current teacher education programs do not sufficiently prepare mathematics
              teachers to implement the current recommendations of national mathematics
              groups. The TIME 2000 project proposes to address this problem by recruiting
              prospective teachers from the pool of high quality high school mathematics
              students, underrepresented minorities, women, and persons with disabilities,
              into a newly designed, mathematics education program. TIME 2000 plans to
              develop a freshman year program that will conceptually integrate the
              mathematics, the psychology of learning, and mathematics pedagogy. The
              Mathematics Components of the program will integrate such topics as calculus,
              probability, statistics, and discrete mathematics and will employ the latest
              technology and teaching strategies. In the Psychology-Mathematics Education
              Component of the program students will be given the opportunity to confront
              their personal beliefs about the nature of mathematics, the learning of
              mathematics and the teaching of mathematics with respect to their learning
              experiences in the mathematics component of the program. In addition to the
              coursework students will meet with project staff on a regular basis for
              seminars, for special projects, for advisement, and to obtain feedback
              regarding the project. It is expected that the project will have impact on
              teacher education throughout the country. The New York Collaborative for
              Excellence in Teacher Preparation in Mathematics, Science and Technology will
              be the medium through which project staff will share those ideas and activities
              that have been evaluated as effective. The materials developed will be made
              available to facilitate replication throughout the CUNY system and the United
              States.
