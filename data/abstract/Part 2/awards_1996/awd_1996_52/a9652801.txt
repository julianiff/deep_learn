Abstract    :
                    The project continues work to develop exercises for the introductory
              astronomy laboratory. Through computer simulations using real data and computer
              simulations, the modules address a pressing need for modernization. Heretofore,
              laboratories in astronomy have had difficulty providing needed hands-on
              experience because of the faintness of astronomical objects, the inconvenient
              time scale of many phenomena, and the fickleness of weather. Until this
              project, most exercises available to astronomy instructors relied on analysis
              of photographs or canned data, and exemplified techniques that were
              increasingly out-of-date.                The current project, Contemporary
              Laboratory Experiences in Astronomy (CLEA), has developed 8 Windows and 6 Mac
              exercises. Each module consists of software, student guides, teachers' manuals,
              and technical documentation. The material, designed for easy distribution and
              portability, has been widely accepted by astronomy instructors. CLEA software
              is currently at use throughout all the United States and 40 foreign countries,
              reaching at least 10,000 students per year. Four CLEA exercises won the 1994
              COMPUTERS IN PHYSICS educational software prize.                In the next two
              years the project will complete the set of 12 exercises which will serve as a
              resource for astronomy laboratories into the next decade.  An external
              evaluator has begun an extensive assessment of the effectiveness of the
              materials, and the assesment will continue. A CD-ROM, a unified manual, and
              additional data resources for eventual third-party distribution to educational
              users are being produced.
