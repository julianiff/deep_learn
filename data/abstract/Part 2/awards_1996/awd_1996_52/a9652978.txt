Abstract    :
                     This proposal builds on an existing  CD-ROM, "Our Dynamic Planet"  by
              creating a realistic "virtual reality" trip to the seafloor intended for an
              introductory course in oceanography. It supports work that will double the
              content of an existing project, and enable students to explore a broader
              spectrum of oceanographic sub-disciplines including ocean chemistry, biology,
              marine resource development, and marine technology.  Efforts are focused on
              compiling a rich variety of recently collected data from the world's mid-ocean
              ridges and enhancing the "point and click" user interface to facilitate
              student-subject matter interaction. Supportive curriculum materials that will
              be integral to CD-ROM are a key component of this initiative.  Students will
              work with seafloor topography, seafloor geology, sea life, and hydrothermal hot
              springs. The students will also have access to other types of data, such as
              water chemistry, temperature, light attenuation, rock chemistry, magnetic
              intensity, seismic structure and more.  Students are provided with a discovery
              experience tied to observations and data taken during actual research
              expeditions that investigate the link between lithosphere, hydrosphere, and
              biosphere that uniquely occurs at mid-ocean ridges, collecting the latest,
              cutting edge results from research oceanographers and packaging them in an easy
              to use and understand format for undergraduate non-science students.       NSF
