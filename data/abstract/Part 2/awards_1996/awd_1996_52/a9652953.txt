Abstract    :
                    This work fills a gap in current CS, EE, ECE, and CE curricula not only at
              the University of Pittsburgh, but throughout the U.S. We create a course and a
              programming environment to enable teaching senior-level undergraduate students
              the important area of real-time systems, including the requirements and
              characteristics of such systems, their internals, and their specification. This
              course, which will be distributed for any interested instructors through
              electronic means, will not only have a theoretical part, but also a practical
              hands-on implementation component. Toward that end, we complement the
              theoretical part with an implementation environment called DIRETOS: DIrect REal
              Time Operating System.   We achieve with DIRETOS the same capabilities provided
              by Berkeley's NACHOS (provides a simple operating system on which students
              build more complex functions) and also by Cornell's HOCA (provides an abstract
              bare machine, so that students can build their own operating system). We use
              the NACHOS model combined with the HOCA model, with variations. These
              variations are based on observations of teaching the class in the last few
              years and on an informal survey of students and industry.
