Abstract    :
              Trying Science: Undergraduate Science Curriculum Reform will create new
              opportunities for undergraduate students to experience scientific investigation
              in real-world problem contexts.  The Grand River, a local resource, will serve
              as an important connecting theme and an outdoor laboratory. The proposed plan
              involves a three-year curriculum reform at Lake Erie College that will impact
              75% of our 700 students.     Faculty from arts, sciences and education will
              create new or modified science courses specifically designed for the General
              Education requirement. These courses will attract non-science students and
              education majors to the excitement of scientific inquiry. Students will
              collaborate in active learning experiences that will encourage
              cross-disciplinary connections and the practice of scientific problem-solving
              skills. These skills are of particular importance to future teachers who will
              act as disseminating agents for our curricular reform.     Summer learning
              experiences will utilize the rich local resources of science practitioners and
              our local natural resources to establish connections between the campus, the
              community and the local environment. In keeping with our institutional mission,
              new courses will address science-based and intercultural issues in an
              international context. Students and faculty will develop multimedia
              presentations reflecting the learning outcomes of the new science courses. 
              Local case studies will serve as a vehicle for student data collection and
              evaluation. Students will create databases and will share them with community
              agencies.
