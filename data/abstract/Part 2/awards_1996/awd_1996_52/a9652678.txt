Abstract    :
              9652678    Groffman  Recent research has revealed that snow-covered soils often
              do not freeze, while snow-free soils freeze and thaw many times over the course
              of the winter.  This insulating effect of snow protects plant roots from
              freezing damage, and allows soil biological activity, including the cycling of
              key nutrients such as nitrogen, to occur during the winter.  Research in this
              project will further understanding of the importance of snow as a regulator of
              soil processes and will assess a possibly important effect of global climate
              change.  The researchers will experimentally reduce snow cover on forest plots
              to simulate an early winter "snow drought" as may occur with global warming. 
              It is hypothesized that snow reduction will result in increased soil freezing,
              root death and nutrient loss from forest plots.  The work will be conducted at
              a site funded by the National Science Foundation for Long-Term Ecological
              Research (LTER), allowing the investigators to evaluate the importance of snow
              relative to other factors influencing the structure and function of forest
              ecosystems.
