Abstract    :
              The Community College of Philadelphia (CCP), recognizing that the body of
              knowledge taught in our undergraduate studies curricula does not reflect
              required linkages of science, technology and social science content, proposes
              to develop and implement a new undergraduate curriculum entitled `Culture,
              Science and Technology.`     During the past two years, a Faculty Steering
              Committee has developed a structure for the new curriculum and has identified
              courses meeting the educational objectives in the degree programs. The Steering
              Committee also proposed innovative student support systems including learning
              communities, collaborative learning and supplemental instruction to assist our
              diverse student body to be successful in preparing for careers in science, math
              and technology.    To implement the proposed curriculum, a group of faculty
              will identify common themes, curricular materials, and pedagogical methods
              (based on prior innovations in science, math and technology) that will enhance
              students' understanding of the interactive and complex relationship between
              culture and technology.   CCP anticipates enrolling 3,400 students and training
              150 faculty over the proposed three- year developmental period. The College is
              making a major in-kind contribution to the development of the curriculum and is
              committed to the program's continuation at the close of the funding period, as
              well as extensive evaluation and dissemination of results. Due to the size of
              CCP and diversity of our student body, our proposed curriculum would serve as a
              model for two-year schools struggling to develop a curriculum involving a
              systematic study of the natural sciences, related technology and their
              interrelationship with a changing society.
