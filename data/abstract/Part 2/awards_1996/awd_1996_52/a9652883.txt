Abstract    :
              Science education should be designed to promote critical thinking,
              problem-solving skills and creativity.  In this context, Antarctic Science and
              Policy: Interdisciplinary Research Education (ASPIRE) will involve students in
              a creative educational environment where they will learn by refining questions;
              designing and implementing self-directed projects; and contributing to group
              decision-making efforts.  ASPIRE will be developed over 2 years as a model
              capstone course for Earth system science curricula which are emerging in
              universities across the nation.  Each student in ASPIRE will become an
              "ambassador" for the purpose of developing and negotiating recommendations
              which will be presented in writing and orally in Mock Antarctic Treaty
              Consultative Meetings.  Interactive multi-media courseware will be designed to
              help students enhance their inquiry skills.  Additional student-teacher
              interactions will be facilitated through the World Wide Web site which will be
              upgraded at the Byrd Polar Research Center.  An Advisory Committee will be
              established to ensure that ASPIRE will be successfully designed, implemented,
              evaluated and disseminated.  Evaluation will be ongoing throughout the project
              to ensure that ASPIRE (1) employs appropriate pedagogical theories and
              practices, (2) contributes to student knowledge gain, and (3) fosters creative
              information seeking and decision-making.  Beyond introducing the unique fusion
              of international and interdisciplinary science in Antarctica, ASPIRE will help
              students develop the Socratic skills which are inherent to learning and
              thriving in our increasingly complex society.
