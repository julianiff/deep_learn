Abstract    :
              The philosophy of the Panola College Interdisciplinary Technology Center project
              revolves around the idea that it takes faculty from all disciplines working
              together to educate each student. A problem being faced by the institution is
              that academic populations often become compartmentalized and disinterested in
              other disciplines. The project is developing technology based cross-curriculum
              lessons in the academic foundation courses by building on experiences in
              physics and English which introduce students to both technology and other
              disciplines. The interdisciplinary lessons and activities simultaneously expose
              the diverse population of students to a technology education and to the
              connections between disciplines that make for a whole education.     Goals are
              being achieved by establishing a resource and activity center with open access
              to the latest instructional technology for the faculty and students of Panola
              College. Faculty are developing curricular materials and revising all classes
              to include technological applications. The Center allows simultaneous use by
              structured and unstructured groups involved in varied activities, so students
              learn different applications.    Outcomes include improved faculty cooperation
              across science and other disciplines, a more computer- and technology-literate
              student body, a more involved and interrelated curriculum, a more progressive
              faculty, and a program of workforce training more appropriate for the job
              markets students will face.
