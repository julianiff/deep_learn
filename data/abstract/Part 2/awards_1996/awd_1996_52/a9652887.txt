Abstract    :
                 Students first learn statistical thinking through simple graphics like bar
              charts and histograms. At the college level, a graphical approach to statistics
              is less often used. This is so in part because good graphics have only just
              become available on computers. Possibly a more important reason is that while
              numerical methods have a firm mathematical footing, graphical statistics have
              consisted primarily of methods of graphing, without accompanying theory.    In
              this research, the project is developing a theoretically sound graphical
              approach to regression analysis, which is the collection of statistical
              techniques designed to understand how one variable depends on others. What
              differentiates this project from others on graphics is the development of a
              unified theory to make graphs more comprehensible, and much more useful in the
              analysis of data. The project is producing self-contained teaching materials,
              textbooks and teacher's aids, and presenting workshops for college teachers on
              how to use this material.
