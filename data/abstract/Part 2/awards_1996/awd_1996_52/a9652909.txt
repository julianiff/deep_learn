Abstract    :
                The Caltech Chemistry Animation Project combines the technical skills of
              faculty and students at Caltech with Emmy-award winning sound editors,
              Oscar-winning sound supervisors, Emmy-winning film editors, professional
              narrators, film score writers, computer graphics personnel from the Hollywood
              special effects industry, and advanced computer workstations to prepare
              instructional materials that are being used worldwide, at the high school and
              college levels, to allow students and teachers to understand better the
              fundamental concepts in their chemical world. The initial stages of this
              project have been highly successful, with distribution currently proceeding in
              five countries to audiences in excess of one-half million students. The
              continuation of NSF support allows the completion this project so that a series
              of approximately 10 video tapes, comprising a library of fundamental concepts
              in the chemical sciences, can be provided to teachers and students worldwide.  
               Specific topics to be dealt with in upcoming video titles under the proposed
              project continuation include: Atoms, Molecules, and Moles; Lewis Dot Structures
              and Bonding; Binary Crystals; and Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution. These
              will complement the existing video titles covering the topics of atomic
              orbitals, VSEPR, crystals, stereochemistry, nucleophilic substitution, the
              Diels-Alder reaction, and will also complement the soon-to-be-released
              videotapes on periodic trends, hybridization and resonance, and molecular
              orbitals.
