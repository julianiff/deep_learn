Abstract    :
              Salish Kootenai College Environmental Science faculty proposes to develop an
              instructional methodology which infuses scientific and environmental literacy
              and critical thinking throughout the overall college curricula. The
              philosophical basis of this project is that professionals in any field must
              have the ability to synthesize relevant scientific and environmental
              information into decision-making. Environmental sciences provide the natural
              bridge between the sciences and non-science curricula, particularly for Native
              American students, because interest in the environment and natural resources is
              traditionally strong.  This project will include curriculum development on two
              levels. First is pairing of eight environmental courses with eight courses in
              other disciplines, including Native American studies, business management,
              English, math, anthropology, nursing, human services, and computer sciences.
              These course pairings will involve integrated student projects, parallel
              topics, and group discussions. Second is incorporation of environmental modules
              into nine other course disciplines, developed by environmental sciences and
              other instructors as a cooperative effort.   Results will be disseminated as a
              manual, on the internet, and in professional meetings.
