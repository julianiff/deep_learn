Abstract    :
                     In this project, we are gathering information about the workplace
              environments where physics-educated individuals are employed.  The study has
              two parts.  First, an "onsite" study based on journals kept by physicists in
              the workplace.  Second, a survey of a particular cohort of physicists in the
              workplace, namely, those individuals five years after graduation.  The results
              will be published and disseminated.
