Abstract    :
              Glaser   9652692    Chemical and Physical Controls on Transport Processes in
              Large Peatlands    Northern peatlands represent an important source and sink
              for greenhouse gases.  Attempts to estimate these fluxes of greenhouse gases
              between the atmosphere and biosphere and relate them to global change, however,
              are limited by uncertainties regarding the material properties of peat.  These
              parameters are difficult to quantify by traditional methods, which alter the
              delicate fabric of peat and are incapable of resolving the three dimensional
              (3D) structure of peat pores.  Current estimates for the porosity of peat
              deposits and their release of greenhouse gases may therefore have errors in
              excess of several orders of magnitude.      A new approach for determining the
              fine structure of porous materials is Computerized Tomography (CT) and Magnetic
              Resonance Imaging (MRI).  The investigators will use these techniques in
              conjunction with visualization software to quantify 1) the 3D pore structure,
              2) structural changes produced by laboratory experiments, and 3) production of
              greenhouse gases in peat cores.  These values can then be used to model the
              role of  peatlands in global  change.
