Abstract    :
                  During the past eight years we have developed, taught and fine-tuned the
              upper division mathematics course "Great Theorems: The Art of Mathematics".
              Unlike many upper division courses which present the results of one specialized
              field via a litany of technical constructions, our course offers the motivating
              problems and original solutions which inaugurated various branches of
              mathematics (e.g. integration, number theory, analysis, abstract algebra). By
              reading the original sources, students witness first hand the genesis of
              history's most revolutionary ideas in mathematics.        The course serves as
              a lively capstone experience for students majoring in science, engineering,
              education, and mathematics. It can also be offered as an upper division
              elective to students who have completed one year of Calculus instruction.      
               Teaching successfully with this pedagogy requires not only an appropriate
              collection of original sources, but also mathematical and historical
              annotations, as well as commentary, placing the sources in context. We will
              write a book of annotated original sources entitled "Discovery of Ideas:
              Revolutionary Theorems in Mathematics," to fulfill this need, using editorial
              feedback from an advanced graduate assistant who will do apprentice teaching of
              the course with our manuscript.
