Abstract    :
              IBN:  9634357  PI:  Niebur    In order to avoid information overload, by far the
              largest part of the   input to our sensory organs has to be discarded by the
              brain, and only   carefully selected parts are allowed to influence behavior
              and to   reach long-term memory. This process is called selective attention and
                it is the focus of intense research in psychology, neurobiology and   the
              computational sciences. In this project, we will design and test   analog VLSI
              chips which implement neurobiologically plausible models   of the attentional
              selection process that we have developed   previously. The system will be
              tested on standard visual search   paradigms as used routinely in psychological
              experiments with monkey   and human subjects.  Building such "neuromorphic"
              devices is expected   to greatly benefit the understanding of biological
              perception since   the designer of a working and robust system has to overcome,
              and thus   to understand, many of the same functional constraints biological  
              systems are faced with (noise, limited connection possibilities etc).   Also
              machine vision should benefit significantly from this work since   technical
              image understanding systems will be confronted with the same   problem of
              information overload as biological organisms are, once the   still primitive
              stage of computer vision (compared to biological   vision) will be surpassed.
