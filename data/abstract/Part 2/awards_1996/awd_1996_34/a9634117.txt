Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9634117    A chromatographic technique, which has proven to be a
              fast and reliable method for determining solid solubilities in supercritical
              fluids (SCFs), will be applied to pharmacological solids.  This investigation
              intends to first measure solid solubilities of a variety of pharmacological
              solids and second to propose mathematical models describing their
              phase-equilibrium behavior in a varietv of supercritical fluids.    The
              phase-equilibrium behavior obtained in this investigation will help design
              effective specialty separation solutions for pharmaceutical applications.  In
              addition, this investigation will further the understanding of phase equilibria
              involving complex involatile substances in supercritical fluids.  This
              knowledge will help in the development of more sophisticated and comprehensive
              models describing phase equilibria with SCFS.
