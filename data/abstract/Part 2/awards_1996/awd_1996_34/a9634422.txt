              Lay Summary    Principal Investigators:  Gamlin, Twieg  Proposal Number:  IBN-l
              9634422    Recent developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow
              researchers to investigate the functional activation of the brain that is
              associated with particular sensory, cognitive, and motor functions.  To date,
              most of these functional MRI (fMRI) studies have been conducted at relatively
              low magnetic field strengths, but we can achieve higher resolutions using
              higher field strengths.  Also, although a number of studies have investigated
              functional activation of the brain by various visual stimuli and during certain
              eye movements, few of these studies have attempted to confirm fixation accuracy
              or eye movement performance.  This is a shortcoming of these studies, because
              if one is unsure that the subject is maintaining fixation or looking at the
              required target, it is hard to interpret the results of the experiment.  
              Furthermore, in earlier studies, the optical systems did not permit the eyes to
              view high-resolution images.  One aim of the research funded by this proposal
              is to establish a collaboration to solve technical problems that must be
              remedied to further understanding of how the human visual and eye movement
              systems operate.  More specifically the aim is to develop and build a
              high-resolution optical and eye-tracking system to be used in a high-field MRI
              system.       It is expected that the system developed through funding of this
              grant will be invaluable to all eye movement and vision-related fMRI studies,
              and will result in significant advances in our understanding of the workings of
              the human brain.
