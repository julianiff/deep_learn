Abstract    :
              9634262  Benner   In this project, the development and testing of a diffusion
              denuder sulfur chemiluminescence detector  (D/SCD) for sub-part-per-billion
              levels of sulfur dioxide in ambient air will be continued. The performance of
              this technique will be tested in a double-blind intercomparison at the South
              Dakota School of Mines and Technology. During a previous double-blind
              evaluation of this technique, problems were encountered with measuring sulfur
              dioxide at part-per-trillion levels, and a second evaluation was recommended by
              the Gaseous Sulfur Intercomparison Study (GASIE) planning committee.
              Interference issues have been identified and will be remedied.  ***
