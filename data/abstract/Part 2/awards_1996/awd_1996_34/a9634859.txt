Abstract    :
              9634859   Webster   Acoustic emission (AE) is an in-process sensing technique
              that offers promise in detecting grinding damage like burning, residual stress
              or cracking.  While filtered root-mean-square AE signals have been used in a
              number of grinding applications, using the unfiltered signal with advanced
              signal processing methods has the potential to provide better signatures for
              identifying and classifying grinding damage.  This project will design signal
              processing methods to handle AE signals in the 0.015 - 1.2 MHz range, and
              determine the detection and classification methods to monitor different types
              of grinding damage.  Using the facilities of the Center for Grinding Research
              and Development at the University of Connecticut, the experimental program will
              consider workpiece burn detection in creep-feed and shallow-cut grinding, and
              surface and subsurface damage in ceramic grinding.  This project has a balance
              between theory and experiment. Of particular significance for a university lab,
              is the capability to gather experimental data on creep feed grinding.        
              The use of AE sensor technology and signal processing has the potential for
              improving the material removal rates and productivity in grinding by preventing
              grinding burn.  This will allow the material removal rates to be increased
              without a penalty in productivity,  quality or component performance.
