Abstract    :
              9634750  Daskin  This research involves the development of integrated models of
              production and distribution for perishable products.  Determining inventory
              levels and delivery schedules for products that deteriorate physically (such as
              fresh foods and certain blood products) or whose economic value decays rapidly
              (such as newspapers) present a number of problems for decision makers.  The
              investigators will develop and analyze models that address the timing and
              reliability of product distribution, location of product distribution centers,
              trade-offs between large production facilities where economies of scales may be
              gained and multiple plants that may be closer to customers, and routing product
              from distribution centers under time-window constraints.  These models will
              include uncertainty in both supply and demand of product.  The investigators
              will work closely with a large blood products supplier to ensure relevancy to
              industry needs.  In many industries, the economic value of goods is
              substantially reduced if their production and distribution is not timely and
              reliable.  Moreover, the production and distribution systems must be integrated
              in order to be most effective.  This research should lead to better tactical
              and operational models in highly competitive industries, and ultimately to
              better decisions regarding trade-offs between investments, operations, and
              customer service.
