Abstract    :
              9634141  Lyle  These investigators from University of Michigan and Boise State
              University in Idaho will undertake a research cruise in the eastern Pacific
              Ocean to investigate detailed climatic and oceanographic conditions during the
              Paleogene period, a time of exceptional worldwide warmth compared to modern
              times.  They will examine sediments deposited in a N-S transect across the
              Paleogene equator to determine the source (North America vs Asia) of wind-borne
              clay and silt, which will provide direct evidence of the location of the
              Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone in the ancient atmosphere.  They will also
              examine fossils in the sediments to evaluate oceanographic conditions, and
              these data will be used to constrain models of the "Eocene hot house"
              conditions of worldwide warmth.  In addition to these research topics, the
              seismic reflection and sediment core data collected during this cruise will be
              used to guide selection of specific sites for future deep ocean drilling to
              study this problem in more detail on a proposed cruise of D/V JOIDES
              Resolution, a vessel which conducts deep-ocean drilling for an international
              consortium of member nations coordinated by the National Science Foundation
              through the NSF Ocean Drilling Program.  ***
