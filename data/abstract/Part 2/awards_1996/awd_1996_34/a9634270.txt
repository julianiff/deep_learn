Abstract    :
              9634270  Past efforts to apply TQM techniques to construction  engineering and
              management have not been successful due to  the dissimilarity between the areas
              of manufacturing and  industrial engineering to construction engineering and 
              management.  This proposal suggests that the area of  construction engineering
              and management needs immediate  information feedback techniques such as those
              developed for  manufacturing and process engineering.  The competitive 
              environment of the construction industry urges the necessity  to know current
              status of budgets, quantities, materials,  procurement, and crew locations.  As
              technology has  increased, the ability to track money, time, and materials  has
              also increased through the use of scheduling,  estimating, and database
              software.  There remains the  problem of a significant time delay between
              events and  knowing the status of those events.  This research will  adapt TQM
              techniques to the construction industry to achieve  immediate information
              feedback and event status.  It will  identify events in the construction
              industry in which  immediate information is highly desirable, as well as 
              methods to achieve immediate feedback.  finally, this  research will develop a
              plan by which to realize actual  immediate feedback techniques in the
              construction industry.
