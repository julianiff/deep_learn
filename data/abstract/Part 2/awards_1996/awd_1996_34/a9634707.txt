Abstract    :
              9634707  Moosbrugger  This project is to study the effect of a changing 
              crystallographic texture in the case of cyclic material  deformations.  For
              monotonic loadings these effects have  been studied extensively, but for cyclic
              deformations the  understanding is poor.  This lack of understanding affects 
              crack initiation models as well as crack growth and failure  evaluations in
              general.  Grain size and texture play  important roles in the dislocation
              substructures and their  interactions determine the residual stresses in
              metals.  In  this project a combined modeling and experimental program  will be
              studied in nickel single crystals.  With this data  base, explicit
              polycrystalline models including  heterogeneous grain substructure will be
              built to study the  influence of grain size and texture on back stress in
              cyclic  plasticity and ratchetting type loading histories.  ***
