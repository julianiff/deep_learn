Abstract    :
              Because television has the potential to reach a large number of children in an
              engaging manner, it has been emphasized as a means to promote science literacy
              through programs such as the "Magic School Buss" and "Bill Nye the Science
              Guy."  However, there has been no quantitative analyses of what these programs
              actually present.  In this study, the PIs will develop and test a coding scheme
              to look for the frequency of occurrence of characteristics in a number of
              children's science programs.  These characteristics will include both
              substantive issues, such as the physical appearance of characters on the
              program and verbal references to science, as well as production features, such
              as lighting and sound effects, that may affect how children perceive science.
