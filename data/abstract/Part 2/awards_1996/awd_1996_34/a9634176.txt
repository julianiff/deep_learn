Abstract    :
              9634176  Storm    This  project  supports  the  attendance  of  advanced  U.S. 
              graduate students at the 1996 Gordon Research Conference  on  the Chemistry and
              Physics of Nanostructure Fabrication.  The  conference,  to be held June 23-28,
              1996 at the New  England  College  in Henniker, NH, is organized by Margaret B.
               Stern  of  MIT Lincoln Laboratory (Chairman) and John N. Randall of  Texas  
              Instruments  (Chairman-Elect).    The   science   of  nanostructure 
              fabrication  is vital  not  only  to  today's  information  revolution but to
              the  fields  of  imaging  and  manipulation of chemical and biological
              structures.   Future  progress  in  all these disciplines is paced by advances 
              in  the  science and technology of nanofabrication that will  be  discussed  at
              this conference.  The conference  format  -  a  week  of continuous interaction
              with experts in interrelated  fields   in  a  casual  setting -  provides  a 
              particularly  rewarding  opportunity  for graduate  students  to  exchange 
              ideas  with  and  to  learn from this gathering  of  leading  researchers.  %%%
               This  award  integrates  science and education  by  enabling  graduate 
              students  to  interact  directly  with   forefront  researcher in the field of
              nanostructure fabrication.  ***
