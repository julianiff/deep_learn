Abstract    :
              The main objective of this project is to develop a "point design" for an
              advanced MIMD computer system capable of achieving at least 100 TeraOPS
              performance with technology that will definitely become feasible in less than a
              decade.  This design will take advantage of free-space optical technologies to
              produce a one-dimensional building block (BB) that implements efficiently a
              large, almost fully-connected system of processors.  In addition to having a
              scaleable architecture, our BB is also technology scaleable, and therefore the
              number of contained processors in the BB could increase dramatically with
              expected improvements in optical technologies.   A simple two-dimensional
              structure is proposed for the complete system, where the aforementioned
              one-dimensional BB is extended into two dimensions.  With readily available
              technology, the word-wide optical interconnection network can be viewed as a
              mesh of relatively short plastic bars to which interfaces to processor cards
              are attached.  Each processor card contains eight processors interconnected
              locally with an electronic crossbar.  Taking advantage of higher-speed optical
              technologies, all eight processors share the same optical interface to the
              two-dimensional system.  Its high-level architecture is also scaleable, because
              it can be extended straight forwardly for any number of dimensions larger than
              two.
