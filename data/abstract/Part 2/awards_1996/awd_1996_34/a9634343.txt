Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT  McDonald  This grant will enable the American Academy of Arts  and 
              Sciences to continue to manage U.S. scientific  participation in the
              International Institute for  Applied  Systems Analysis (IIASA) through the U.S.
               Committee for  IIASA, for which it serves as  secretariat.  IIASA, located 
              near Vienna, Austria, is  a non-governmental multilateral  research
              institution,  one of whose areas of particular  emphasis is the  human
              dimensions of global change.  The  institute is  comprised of 18 National
              Member Organizations  (NMOs), including the United States, Canada, Japan, 
              Russia,  and several Western European countries.   Representatives of  these
              NMOs serve as its governing  council.  The U.S.  National Committee for IIASA 
              serves as the NMO for the  United States.  The grant  will support a part time 
              executive secretary to the  committee, in addition to  expenses for committee 
              meetings and travel to IIASA, when  necessary.  It  will also support six new
              U.S. scientists  and  engineers per year to participate in research at  IIASA 
              through its Young Summer Scientists Program.
