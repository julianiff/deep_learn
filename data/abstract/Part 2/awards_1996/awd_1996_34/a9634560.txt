Abstract    :
                  9634560  Murtha-Smith  Progressive  collapse  is  a catastrophic  mode  of 
              failure  started  by  localized damage occurring at operating  loads.  The
              objectives are to investigate the role of each nonlinear  member in a
              progressive collapse mechanism, explore the role  of secondary effects in the
              survival of damaged DLG systems,  correlate  linear and nonlinear AP analyses
              to determine  if  linear  analysis can be used to predict performance  and  be 
              used  for  design,   develop a method  that  can  rationally  modify  a  design
               using the linear  AP  method  to  improve  progressive collapse resistance.
