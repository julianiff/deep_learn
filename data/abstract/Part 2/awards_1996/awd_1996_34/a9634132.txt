Abstract    :
                    This "undershooting" experiment, on the East Pacific Rise    between 8 and
              10 degrees north, will use seismic velocity    and attenuation and anomalies of
              Pn arrivals, and Sn waves    if they are observed, to map km-scale variations
              in the    vertical distribution on melt near the base of the crust    along the
              ridge axis.  The magnitude and orientation of    anisotropy in Pn velocities
              will be used to constrain the    direction of mantle flow near the Moho.  The
              goals of the    project are to: (1) map along-axis variations in the seismic   
              velocity and attenuation structure of the uppermost mantle    along he entire
              segment, (2) map the orientation and    magnitude of anisotropy in the
              uppermost mantle, (3)    determine the vertical structure of the lowermost
              crust,    Moho transition zone, and uppermost mantle directly beneath    the
              axis of accretion at three contrasting sites, (4)    measure crustal thickness
              variations along an entire    transform-bounded ridge segment, and (5) compare
              the results    with existing observations and models of segmentation.
