Abstract    :
              Application software for 100 TeraOps machines be based on the increasing use of
              component software (libraries, GUIs, problem solving environments) and
              extensive use of interoperability frameworks (CORBA, OLE, SOM, etc.), producing
              applications which are complex conglomerates of variegated programs.  To
              support these applications, the machine must present  a programmable interface
              (i.e. efficient shared address spaces and data movement) and scaleable high
              performance.  This project will study a flexible machine architecture that
              recognizes these technological realities and not only supports advanced
              software structures, but exploits them to configure its programmable hardware,
              adapting itself to the application.  The programming flexibility can provide a
              wide range of convenient interfaces, ranging from uniform cache-coherent shared
              memory, to clusters of smaller shared memory systems, to fully distributed
              memory.  In addition to a range of interfaces, this flexible machine can
              customize both operations and protocols, exploiting appropriate mechanisms and
              policies to minimize the critical performance aspect--communication--at all
              levels of the system.  This machine design leverages the wealth of research
              into optimal architectural mechanisms, customizable cache-coherence, as well as
              technological advances in interprocedural analysis, programmable hardware, and
              hardware synthesis technology, to achieve general-purpose high performance.
