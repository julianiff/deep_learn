Abstract    :
              9634537 Bose This proposal requests a travel grant from NSF for scholars at US
              universities to attend the Power Systems Computation Conference (PSCC) in
              Dresden, Germany, to be held from August 19-23, 1996.  Since its inception in
              1963, PSCC has evolved to become the leading international conference outside
              the US in the area of power systems computer applications.  This 12th
              conference will be an excellent opportunity to exchange views and ideas with
              some of the key people in the field from around the world.  The conference will
              have over 150 technical papers, three survey papers, four tutorials, and one
              panel session on very timely topics. ***
