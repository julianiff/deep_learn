Abstract    :
                   The current project is to complete the research necessary for  writing a
              grammar of Pilaga, a Guaykuruan language of Argentina.       The Guaykuruan
              languages represent a significant gap in our  current knowledge of languages of
              the world. At present, no  comprehensive grammar exists for any language of
              this family.  Furthermore, linguists have no clear sense of how the Guaykuruan 
              family is genetically related to any other family.       A grammar of Pilaga
              will serve various purposes. One is to  document a language about which
              information is extremely scarce.  A reference grammar of Pilaga will address
              topics of current  interest among general linguists, such as grammatical
              relations,  word order, lexicalization patterns and syntactic reanalysis of 
              categories.       The grammar will be accompanied by a collection of texts 
              that will capture part of the Pilaga culture, and illustrate the  use of the
              language in various discourse genres, including  narrative and conversational
              discourse.       Methods to be employed are a combination of traditional  field
              techniques, i.e., recording, transcribing and translating  texts; modern data
              processing; and the application of some recent  methodologies in discourse
              analysis.       The timing is urgent for this project. Pilaga is spoken by 
              2500 people and is under intense sociolinguistic pressure from  Spanish. The
              language of the youngest generations shows a high  level of borrowings and
              switching between Spanish and Pilaga  during particular linguistic exchanges is
              evident.
