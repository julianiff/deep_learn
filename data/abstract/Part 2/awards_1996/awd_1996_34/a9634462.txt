              Innovation in VLSI Systems Education:  Integration of High Level Synthesis,
              Analysis and Test Generation Research Results into Undergraduate Minor
              Curriculum in VLSI Systems Engineering    This CISE Educational Innovation
              award supports the integration of research in high-level VLSI synthesis,
              performance analysis and test vector generation into the undergraduate
              curriculum in VLSI systems engineering.  The model curriculum will contain
              topics on the development of high-level functional and behavioral modeling of
              VLSI designs, use of high-level VLSI synthesis techniques and tools, developing
              and using performance models throughout the design process, and generation of
              design verification tests.  Curriculum support material will include mini-books
              on these topics, term project modules, and, most importantly, free software
              tools for high-level synthesis, performance analysis and test generation.  All
              of the curriculum material will disseminated through the Internet and the
              World-Wide-Web.
