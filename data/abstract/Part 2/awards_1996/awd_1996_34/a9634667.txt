Abstract    :
                  9634667  Black     Anomalous weather regimes are an important component of
              the short term climate system, causing persistent extremes in regional weather.
               Where many studies have focused on the maintenance of persistent weather
              patterns, under this award,  the principal investigator  (PI) will consider the
              full time evolution of these systems and the processes responsible for their
              evolution.     In this study, the PI will analyze both gridded observational
              data sets and model simulations produced with the Community Climate Model (CCM)
              of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  The detailed analyses
              will done using a reformulated (for nonconservative flow on a sphere) version
              of a methodology known as piecewise tendency diagnosis.  They will be focused
              on determining the roles of diabatic and frictional processes in regime
              transitions.  In addition, Dr. Black will conduct numerical experiments in
              which the model's sensitivity to initial large-scale anomaly structure and
              model physics are assessed.       The results of this study are likely to
              provide important insights into the intraseasonal variability of the
              midlatitude troposphere which will allow improvements in extended range weather
              forecasting.  ***
