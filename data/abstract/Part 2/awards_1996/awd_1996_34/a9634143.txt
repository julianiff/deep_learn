Abstract    :
              9634143  Eggleston    This grant provides $88,976 as partial support of the
              costs of  acquiring a scanning probe microscope system (SPM) at the  University
              of Wyoming.  This instrument will allow high  resolution (sub-nano scale)
              imaging of electrostatic forces on  mineral and/or material surfaces.  As such,
              it can be used to  study the in situ redox conditions at site-specific mineral 
              surfaces, allowing an understanding of the kinetics of oxidation  of sulfide
              minerals.  Additionally, the imaging capabilities of  the SPM WILL be used for
              high-resolution studies of mineral  dissolution and precipitation mechanisms. 
              This facility will  benefit a wide range of researchers within the Department
              of  Geology and also within the Departments of Chemistry, Zoology and 
              Physiology.  ***
