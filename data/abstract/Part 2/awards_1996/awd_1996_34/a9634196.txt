Abstract    :
              9634196  Bergbreiter  This  grant  will explore several new aspects of 
              polyolefin  surface  modification. The initial stages  of  the  proposed 
              project will extend prior studies on "responsive" surfaces -  surfaces  that 
              reversibly  change hydrophilicity,  adhesion  and/or  reactivity  in  response 
              to  external  physical  or  chemical stimuli.  By incorporating several
              different  sorts  of   spectroscopic  probes  and  by  chemically  tuning  the 
              structure of polymer grafts, it will be possible to test how  to   chemically  
              control  and  manipulate   solvation   and  reactivity  at  polymer  surfaces.
              This  chemistry  will  be  explored  with  linear  brush-like grafts.   Second,
               a  new  approach  to  surface grafting using hyperbranched  polymers  will  be
               studied. Preliminary work has already  shown  that  hyperbranched   grafting 
              chemistry  can  generate   heavily  functionalized thin (10 - 150 nm) films of
              polymer grafts at  surfaces.   This  chemistry can also  be  used  to  generate
               responsive   surfaces   and  can,  by  design,   incorporate  spectroscopic 
              labels  either in the  graft  phase,  at  the  graft/solvent  interface  or at 
              the  graft  phase/substrate  interface.   Finally, known metallocene  catalysts
               used  in  polypropylene  polymerization make terminally functionalized 
              stereoregular  polypropylene  oligomers  readily  available.  Such   oligomers 
               can   be   synthetically   modified   and  characterized  using chemistry
              previously  used  to  prepare  terminally  functionalized  polyethylene 
              oligomers.   These  terminally functionalized polypropylene oligomers will 
              then  be  used  to  prepare  surface functionalized  polypropylene  films  by 
              a  blending  approach  whose  utility  has   been  established  using
              polyethylene oligomers and a polyethylene  host polymer.  %%%  This  grant  is
              in the area of polymer synthesis for  design  and   modification  of  surfaces.
                This  new  approach   to  polypropylene  functionalization can be used  with 
              the  new  sort s of chemical grafting chemistry to be developed in this 
              proposal and in prior work. The result will be a new way  to  efficiently
              surface modify polypropylene.  ***
