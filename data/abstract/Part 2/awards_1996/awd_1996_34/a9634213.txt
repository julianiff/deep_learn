Abstract    :
              CTS - 9634213  Mark Weisner  Rice University    ABSTRACT      This Project is an
              investigation of the effects of particle size and fluid flow on the morphology
              of colloidal deposits.  Experiments will be performed to evaluate particle
              attachment on granular porous media and directly observe particular disposition
              using microscopy.  The deposit morphology will be characterized by power-law
              relationships of mass distribution as determined by light scattering,
              sedimentation and image analysis. Theory will be developed to predict trends in
              deposit morphology based on physical-chemical characteristics.  Monte Carlo
              simulation results will be compared to theory.  The results may lead to an
              improved understanding of liquid-solid separations used in various
              manufacturing and environmental applications.
