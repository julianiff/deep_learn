Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Office of Special Projects of the Chemistry   Division
              in support of the continuing research of Dr. Andrew Barron at   Rice
              University. The  research will focus on the role of precursor   molecular
              structure during chemical vapor deposition of Group 13-16   materials and the
              synthesis and reactivity of new Group 13-chalcogenide   compounds.  Having
              discovered that metastable solid phases can be formed   from  stable cage
              structure intermediates, conditions will be   investigated which retain the
              cage structure in the gas phase. To this   end, an aerosol-CVD system will be
              built which will eliminate gas phase   decomposition. Specifically, cyclic and
              cage organometallic complexes of   gallium and indium, sufides, selenides and
              tellurides will be synthesized   and decomposed under conditions designed to
              preserve the structural   integrity of the precursors, New phases will be
              characterized by Auger   spectroscopy, XPS, TEM, SEM, x-ray diffraction and
              electron diffraction.   Mechanistic studies of phase growth will be followed by
              time-of-flight   mass spectrometry and matrix isolation of the decomposition
              products.   Other studies will investigate the use of gallium-sulfide cages as 
               molecular building blocks for extended mesophase structures and the use   of
              caged gallium sulfide structures as models for alumoxanes in Ziegler  
              polymerization.  The fundamental chemistry of Group 13-16 chalcogenides is less
              well   developed than the corresponding oxides  This research will define the  
              structural and kinetic requirements for the design and synthesis of new   solid
              phases for applications in compound semiconductors, catalysis, and   porous
              zeolite-like materials.
