Abstract    :
              Khoshnevis  9634962  As an emerging technology, rapid prototyping is
              revolutionizing every sector of industry, creating great opportunities to
              design and manufacture products of superior quality with shorter lead-time and
              low costs. Methods like selective photocuring, selective sintering, droplet
              deposition on powder,and 3D printing have been explored by many researchers and
              practitioners. The major technological constraints for using the rapid
              prototyping technologies are poor surface finishing, limited size, and
              dimensional shrinkage of parts.  There is a strong need for fabricating large
              parts, superior surface quality, and better mechanical properties.  The
              proposed research project will develop a Contour Crafting (CC) rapid
              prototyping system, a new additive fabrication technology, which can produce
              extremely smooth surface finishing.  The Contour Crafting process uses computer
              control of troweling motion of a forming mechanism to create smooth and
              accurate planar and free-form surfaces.   This is a hybrid method that combines
              an extrusion process for forming the object surfaces and a filling process to
              build the object core. The research project has a  balance between theory and
              experiment, and will provide valuable findings for the rapid prototyping
              industry.
