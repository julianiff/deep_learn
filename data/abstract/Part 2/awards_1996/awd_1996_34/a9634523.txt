Abstract    :
              This workshop is on evaluating priorities for academic electronic design 
              automation (EDA) research, with the intention that the results of the meeting
              aid  in refocusing the field on its roots.  Both future priorities for research
              and  education, as well as areas that are already well-served by the EDA
              industry and  are unlikely to require major new methodological or technological
              breakthroughs  are considered.  The workshop report includes: (1) a statement
              of the most  pressing problems to solve within the next decade, (2)
              recommendations regarding  the style and kind of research to be conducted and
              suggestions to the community  as to how to implement these suggestions, and (3)
              viewpoints on increasing the  impact of the EDA field on education in
              electrical and computer engineering.
