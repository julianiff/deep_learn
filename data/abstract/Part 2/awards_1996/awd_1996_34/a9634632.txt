Abstract    :
                    9634632  Hutchinson  This project is to study the micromechanics of
              interface adhesion  and toughness with applications to thin films and
              multilayers.   At the most fundamental level, the aim is to link interface 
              separation at the microscopic level, the aim is to link interface  separation
              at the microscopic level through the plastic zone to  connect with macroscopic
              measures of interface toughness.  The  total work of fracture has been shown by
              experiments to be many  times the atomic or molecular work of fracture.  It is
              not  uncommon for the plastic work of fracture to be all but a few  percent of
              the total work of fracture of an interface.  Amount  the challenges addressed
              by the work are crack tip behavior at  small scales linking to the fracture
              process. large scale  yielding effects in films and layers, and mixed mode
              loadings.   There is an increasing body of experimental evidence indicating 
              that strain gradients at the micron to sub-micron level produce  local
              hardening which exceeds that predicted by conventional  plasticity
              formulations.
