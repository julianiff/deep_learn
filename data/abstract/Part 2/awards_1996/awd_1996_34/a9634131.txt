Abstract    :
              9634131  Robbins    This is a renewal grant from a theorist who was awarded a 
              Creativity Extension during the last funding period.  He was  also awarded a
              supplement through the Computational  Approaches to Real Materials program. 
              This research will  focus on the dissipation in spreading, friction,
              lubrication  and adhesion.  All of these processes are of great  technological
              importance and each allows basic scientific  issues to be addressed on
              well-defined model systems that  can be experimentally realized.  Numerical
              simulations will  be used to provide detailed microscopic information about 
              the dynamics in each system.  These will be used to develop  analytic theories
              and to explain and motivate experimental  studies.  %%%  This is a renewal
