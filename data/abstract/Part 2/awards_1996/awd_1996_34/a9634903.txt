Abstract    :
              9634903  Hoger  The  objective  of  the  proposed  research  is  to  develop 
              constitutive  equations for residually  stressed  biological  tissues  and to
              use them to predict the mechanical  response  of  the  residually  stressed
              body to  applied  loads.   The  balance of experimental work with modeling and
              relevance  to  a  specific material applications is excellent.  The  theory 
              will  be  applied  to  cardiac  tissue,  which  supports   a  substantial 
              residual residual stress field  and  which  has  been  the  subject of
              extensive experimental  investigation.  Collaboration with engineers in
              biomechanics will facilitate  the  transition between details of  theoretical
              concern  and  issues   of   practical  applicability.    The   theoretical 
              approaches and computational tools that will be developed in  the context of
              biological tissues should also be relevant to  many   engineering  materials 
              applications  where  residual  stresses also play an important role.  ***
