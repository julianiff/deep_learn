Abstract    :
                The project on the design of realistic uncheatable benchmarks strives to 
              achieve a more sophisticated design methodology of computer performance 
              benchmarks, based on the theory of computational complexity.  The goal is  to
              integrate ideas from randomization and cryptography with realistic  existing
              benchmark in everyday use.  There has been tremendous progress  in theoretical
              computer science in recent years, especially with regard  to the power of
              randomization and interaction.  These ideas are well  suited to the design of
              uncheatable benchmarks.  The purpose of  benchmark testing is to estimate the
              performance and reliability of  hardware and software systems. By and large
              existing benchmark design  has focused on "typical" programs and data sets for
              the system. The  problem of making benchmarks resistant to tampering has been
              mostly  ignored.  The on-going research in this project has demonstrated the 
              feasibility of applying ideas from computational complexity and  cryptography
              to a wide variety of existing benchmarks, and making them  more accurate,
              resistant to tampering and thus more trustworthy.***
