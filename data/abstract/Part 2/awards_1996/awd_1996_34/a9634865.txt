Abstract    :
              9634865  Realff   The textile industry in the U.S. has shifted to demand
              activated manufacturing in response to customer requirements for shorter lead
              times and wider ranges of products.   This project will develop a design
              methodology to configure textile processing machines into systems that can
              respond to these new demands, as well as make the best use of capital
              investment.   There are two parts to the proposed technical approach: system
              design and performance analysis.  System design uses mixed integer linear or
              non-linear programming to choose and configure candidate system elements from
              standard machines that are available.  For performance analysis, discrete event
              simulation will assess the predicted performance and cost of a textile
              processing system.  The approach will lead to the lowest cost feasible system
              by making choices like: direct or sectional warping of yarn onto beams, size of
              a yarn creel, modular or conventional loom, etc.       Such a design
              methodology for equipment configuration is an issue in many types of
              manufacturing systems, in addition to textiles.  In all cases, the issue of
              quickly reorganizing a manufacturing system to meet changing demands is
              interesting, realistic, and has a high potential pay-off.
