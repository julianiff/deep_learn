Abstract    :
                IBN: 9634419  PI: Leonard      Modern technical improvements have made it
              possible to image fine details  of the human brain during life. Unfortunately,
              the great individual   variability that characterizes all biological phenomena
              makes the study of   the brain extremely difficult and time consuming. Since
              the images are   digitized, it should be possible to extract features of
              interest   automatically. In this project, a neuroscientist, an applied
              mathematician   and an  electrical engineer will initiate a collaboration
              designed to to   develop such automation.    The first step will be to identify
              prominent skull landmarks to   triangulate the medial origin of the feature,
              using a technique that   has been proved very effective in ultrasound images of
              the heart.   Once the feature is located, neural network techniques originally 
              developed for automatic target recognition will be utilized to measure its  
              shape and volume. The long term goal is to develop automated methods  for  
              identifying major functional areas in the brain. Such work is a necessary  
              prerequisite for the interpretation of functional imaging data. The   project
              should produce techniques applicable in a wide variety of  fields, including
              cognitive neuroscience, education, industrial,   developmental and cognitive
              psychology, and medicine.
