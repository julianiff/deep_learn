Abstract    :
              9634570  Elgaaly  Economical design of girders normally requires thin webs.  The
              use of corrugated webs is a possible way of achieving  adequate out-of-plane
              stiffness without recourse to using  stiffeners.    A report by the Principal
              Investigator summarizing the  results from a research project, to investigate
              the behavior  of beams with corrugated webs under static loading has been 
              completed.    This project will investigate the behavior of girders with 
              corrugated webs under repeated loading.  Preliminary results  from very limited
              tests indicate that the fatigue strength  for the girders with corrugated webs
              can be higher than for  conventionally stiffened girders.    This project will
              determine the behavior of bridge girders  with corrugated webs under repeated
              loading and establish  the fatigue strength for such girders.  The optimum
              shape of  the corrugation under static loading may not be the optimum  shape
              under repeated loading.  ***
