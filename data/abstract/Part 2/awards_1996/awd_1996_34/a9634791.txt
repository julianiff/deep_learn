Abstract    :
              The proposer will organize a CBMS Conference at  Florida Atlantic University,
              Boca Raton, Florida.  The main lecturer will be Professor Luis Caffarelli, 
              Courant Institute, New York, who will give a series  of 10 lectures on recent
              developments in the theory of the  Monge Ampere equation and its applications
              to geometry and  optimization problems.    The proposer will also arrange
              invited lectures by other  distinguished specialists stressing applications. 
              It is expected that about 30 participants will receive support.
