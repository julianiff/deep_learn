Abstract    :
              9634596  Toner  This is a new award for a theoretical project comprised of 
              three components, all of which involve strongly fluctuating  systems with many
              degrees of freedom.  These components are:  (1) the theory of flocking, i.e.,
              collective motion of large  swarms of organisms that attempt to follow their
              neighbors;  (2) a study of phase transitions in tethered membranes and,  in
              particular, the transitions from the crumpled phase to  the tubule phase and
              the tubule to the flat phase; (3)  application of hydrodynamics to model the
              dynamical  evolution of large fluctuations in smectic A liquid crystals  as
              measured by time resolved x-ray scattering.  %%%  This theoretical research
              will study a number of topics in  the physics of soft condensed matter, that
              is, materials  such as polymers and liquid crystals (used in video  displays). 
              The research also involves studies of flocking.  Flocking is the ability of
              large groups of entities, such as  birds, to almost instantaneously change
              direction as a  group.  How can individual birds know to all move at the  same
              time?  This also applies to biological organisms.  ***
