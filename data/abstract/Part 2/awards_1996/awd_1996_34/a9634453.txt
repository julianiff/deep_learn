Abstract    :
              9634453  Talarico  Most social scientific research on civil courts has focused
              on caseloads, dispute formation, court reforms and selected system actors such
              as attorneys. No study to date has focused on the actors, institutions, and
              process of civil justice as a system.  This dissertation seeks to fill this gap
              in the literature with a neo-institutional study of civil court processes and
              culture. This theoretical framework emphasizes the importance of norms, rules,
              and organizations as constraints on individual behavior. It focuses on three
              questions. What is the effect of institutional change on civil courts? How do
              civil system actors and institutions interact? Is there a distinctive civil
              justice culture? To address these questions, the co-P.I. will analyze both
              quantitative and qualitative data from a single Georgia court system (Hall
              County). This site is appropriate because it features the state's most
              comprehensive alternate dispute resolution program, which has a substantial
              caseload and serves a diverse population.  Case records for the quantitative
              portion of the analysis will be randomly drawn for six years (1989-1994).  They
              will be coded for case type, participants, procedures (e.g. motions and
              hearings), processing time, disposition type, and outcome and analyzed to
              produce a statistical profile of general civil and domestic relations
              litigation and a multivariate analysis of case processing time, disposition
              type, outcome, and other variables over time.  The qualitative portion of the
              research will consist of elite interviews and direct observation of civil court
              processes.
