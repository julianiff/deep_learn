Abstract    :
                        9634927  Leckie  This project is to study the fundamental aspects of
              joints in  metal (MMC) and ceramic (CMC) matrix composite structures.  The 
              research philosophy emphasizes the understanding of the  underlying mechanics
              and its relationship to microstructure and  processing.  The research approach
              is based on the design,  manufacturing, characterization and analysis of
              relatively simple  joint geometries which allow the study of individual
              features of  the physical problem and its underlying mechanisms, e.g. the 
              strength of the interfaces defined by the fiber ends and the  associated debond
              process.  The MMC research will focus on  aluminum alloys reinforced with
              polycrystalline alumina fibers  while the CMC joints will be fabricated by
              vacuum infiltration of  multi-alumina slurries into polycrystalline alumina
              fiber cloth  arranged in layers with prescribed discontinuities.  The 
              microstructure and delamination resistance of these joints can be  modified by
              suitable control of the sintering temperature and  other manufacturing
              parameters.  The emphasis will be identifying  the relevant mechanisms and
              their relationship to processing via  microstructure and defects.  ***
