Abstract    :
              This research involves two components.  The first component is an extension of 
              prior work under NSF grant MIP-9412500 on the development of algorithms for 
              automatic generation of retinal vasculature maps, and real-time feature-based 
              determination of retinal position from intra-ocular digital video image 
              sequences.  Specifically, a TMS320C80 video signal processor chip will be used 
              to achieve fully transparent image tracking by reducing the time required to 
              establish a tracking lock to a small number of video frame intervals.  The
              second  component to this research is to modify the fundus imaging system
              acquired under  the previous award to achieve simultaneous imaging in the near
              infrared and  visible bands using a pair of low-light video cameras.  This
              instrumentation will  be used to investigate real-time algorithms for
              artificially superimposing  computed vasculature landmarks on late-phase
              Indocyanine Green angiograms.    This research will result in the development
              of real-time image processing  hardware and software technology for enabling
              the development of novel  instrumentation for laser retinal surgery and related
              applications.  It is  motivated by the need to reduce the currently high
              failure rate (approaching 50%)  of current procedures.  This project is an
              application of high-performance  computing technology to enable new advances in
              ophthalmology and related problems  in biology and medicine.  In addition to
              reducing the failure rate, this  technology is expected to reduce the cost of
              laser retinal surgery by eliminating  the need for repeated corrective
              procedures.
