Abstract    :
              Hyperbolic systems of conservation laws play fundamental roles in describing a 
              wide variety of physical phenomena, including compressible fluid flows, 
              magnetohydrodynamics, reacting flows, and multiphase flows, among others.  The
              study of shock wave theory is important because it not only provides a  better
              mathematical understanding of these complex phenomena, but also  helps to
              design more robust numerical schemes to solve the underlying  physical
              problems.    The major difficulty associated with shock wave theory is the
              discontinuous  feature of the solution due to the nonlinear convection.  For
              nonlinear systems  understanding the wave interactions are exceedingly hard.
              Although a great  deal of remarkable results on the existence, stability,
              uniqueness and  asymptotic behavior of the solution have been obtained, there
              are still many  challenging open questions for systems and multi-dimensional
              cases.    The goal of the meeting is to provide an opportunity for young
              researchers  to learn systematically the recent development in shock wave
              theory.  The  ultimate goal is to promote more research activities, especially
              among  colleagues in the southeast region, in this direction. The substantial 
              expository paper based on the lectures should have significant influence for 
              future development in this direction.
