Abstract    :
              9634592  Adams  The objective of this conference is to provide a forum  to
              explore the biology, ecology, and biotechnology of  thermophilic
              microorganisms.  The topics to be covered  at this conference include: (1) the
              isolation and  ecology of thermophiles, (2) their phylogeny and  molecular
              analysis, (3) the properties of enzymes and  proteins obtained from them, (4)
              how biological  molecules are stabilized at extreme temperatures, (5)  the
              genetics and genome sequences of some of them, and  (6) Their use in present
              and future biotechnology  applications.  This conference will have an
              attendance  of at least 300 scientists and industrialists from  around the
              world.  ***
