Abstract    :
              The  research introduces a novel axial representation of two- and 
              three-dimensional  shapes  that  implements  Binford's   original  notion  of
              ribbons and generalized cylinders for generic objects.  Unlike   current 
              representation  schemes  based  on  generalized  cylinders, which use much more
              restrictive parametric models such  as  straight  homogeneous  generalized
              cylinders,  and  are  thus  limited to instances of these models, this
              representation can  be  constructed   for  arbitrary  objects  by  computing  
              the   one-  dimensional  valleys of a multi-dimensional height field  defined 
              by  the  area  of intersection of the object and a  parameterized  plane.   The
              main objectives of this research are: (1) to give  a  data-driven,  operational
              definition of ribbons  and  generalized  cylinders  that yields practical
              algorithms for constructing  the  description  of an arbitrary shape from two-
              or three-dimensional  data;   (2)   to   establish  the  formal   properties  
              of   the  representation  with  the  aims  of  assessing  its   scope   and 
              developing rigorous algorithms for detecting generalized cylinder  projections 
              in images; and (3) to develop a principled  approach  to   part   decomposition
               and  use  the  constructed  part-whole  hierarchies  to support efficient
              indexing in object  recognition  tasks.
