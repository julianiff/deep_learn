              Abstract  ATM-9634021  Avissar, Roni  Rutgers University  Title: Bidirectoral
              Ecosystem-Atmosphere Interactions Workshop;            National Space Research
              Center, Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil:          July 8-11, 1996    This is a
              grant for a workshop that will synthesize and stimulate  research on
              vegetation-climate interaction and modeling of the  relevant processes.  This
              will result in three kinds of products:  1) frontier papers on the
              climate-vegetation interactions, 2) a  critically needed and healthy
              interaction among the scientists of  related but different disciplines, and 3)
              background support for  the upcoming international experiment, the Large-scale
              Biosphere-  Atmosphere (LBA) experiment.      This is important because efforts
              to develop climate system models  are presently hindered by incomplete
              knowledge about land-surface  interactions.
