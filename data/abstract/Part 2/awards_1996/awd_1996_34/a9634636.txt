Abstract    :
              This starter grant award to the University of Colorado at Boulder   supports the
              research of Professor Deborah S. Wuttke.  The research   focusses on the
              mechanism by which unstructured polypeptides fold into   protein structures. 
              The technique of time-resolved nuclear magnetic   resonance spectroscopy is
              employed for study in real time of the pathways   of folding and unfolding in
              ribonuclease A.  Through site-specifically,   isotopically labeled residues in
              the N-terminal region of ribonuclease A,   the study takes advantage of the
              ability of 1D nuclear magnetic resonance   spectroscopy to provide information
              on specific sites in a protein during   the course of folding and circumvents
              the difficulties of assignment and   resolution.  Each species is
              well-resolved, allowing the chemical shift   and crosspeak lineshapes, as
              indicators of local structural environment   and dynamical properties, to be
              followed throughout the entire kinetic   process.  The research is important in
              the fundamental understanding of protein   folding and the mechanism of
              formation of ribonuclease A, the protein   that catalyzes the cleavage of
              single-stranded ribonucleic acid in the   course of life-sustaining genetic
              processes.
