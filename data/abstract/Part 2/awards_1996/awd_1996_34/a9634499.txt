Abstract    :
              9634499  Sansalone  Currently, evaluation of post-tensioned structures is 
              performed predominantly by relying on invasive testing.    The project will
              develop methods based on use of impact-  generated stress waves.  Preliminary
              studies on single ducts  located in plate-like structures have shown that such 
              methods have the potential to detect voids in grouted metal  tendon ducts. 
              However, a comprehensive and basic research  study is still needed to (1)
              understand the propagation of  transient stress waves in typical post-tensioned
              structural  geometries, (2) to understand the interaction of stress  waves with
              partial and full voids in ducts, as well as water-  filled voids in ducts, (3)
              the effects caused by the use of  plastic tendon ducts, (4) the interaction of
              stress waves  with ducts closely spaced and ducts located two and three  deep
              in a cross-section, and (5) to determine whether the  extent of grouting in
              ducts can be determined during the  grouting process.  ***
