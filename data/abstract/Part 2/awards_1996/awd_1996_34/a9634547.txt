Abstract    :
              The performance of massively parallel multicomputers depends  largely on their
              processor management scheme. Unfortunately,  the schemes employed in the
              current generation of commercial  multicomputers do not efficiently utilize the
              system  resources. Processor management is concerned with processor  allocation
              and job scheduling. Processor allocation also  affects the interprocessor
              communication latency.  Researchers have addressed these issues independently
              of  each other. However, it is essential to evaluate the  combined effect of
              these issues on system performance. Thus,  this project focuses on an
              integrated study of processor  allocation, job scheduling, and interprocessor 
              communication. The research objectives will be accomplished  in three phases.
              The first phase  encompasses the design and  development of efficient processor
              allocation and job  scheduling schemes while employing a suitable message 
              routing algorithm for interprocessor communication. In the  second phase, the
              integrated effect of allocation,  scheduling, and interprocess communication on
              system  performance is to be studied. The third phase of the  proposed research
              is concerned with the experimental  validation of these schemes.  ***
