Abstract    :
              9634872  Shaw        The silver-sheathed Bi-2212 superconductor has been the
              prime candidate for the applications such as electric generators, motors,
              high-field magnets, transmission cables, superconducting magnetics energy
              storage for the high Tc superconducting wires and tapes.  It needs to  be melt
              processed, between 870-910 Centigrade in air, to transform the oxide precursor
              powder to the proper (PMG) processing has been widely studied, but has several
              drawbacks which have prevented the manufacturing of long length of these
              conductors.  The (IMP) techniques to fabricate 100-400 meter long high
              temperature silver-sheathed superconducting tapes with a critical current
              density greater than 50,000 A/square centimeter.       This project has a
              balance between theory and experiment.  The outcome of this study will lay the
              groundwork for scaling up the IMP technique to produce long BI-2212  conductor.
