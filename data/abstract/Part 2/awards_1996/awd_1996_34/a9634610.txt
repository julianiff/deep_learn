Abstract    :
              9634610  Asher  Description:  This proposal supports the American Institute of 
              Indian Studies (AIIS) for the management and funding of research  activities in
              the behavioral and natural sciences conducted by US  scientists in India. 
              Candidates with background in India are  screened and nominated by AIIS before
              referral to NSF for final  selection.  The AIIS manages the required clearances
              for the  research, the logistics involved in travel, local arrangements  and
              the conduct of research in India.  Areas of research  typically include
              anthropology, linquistics, sociology,  economics, political sciences, as well
              as biology, mathematics  and engineering.  The US-India program supports US
              scholarly  research in India in areas of interest to NSF where the research 
              may be a vehicle for improved bilateral understanding through  science.    
              Scope:  The AIIS is a consortium of more than forty-eight leading  American
              colleges and universities with South Asian or Indian  Studies programs.  The
              Institute's principal activity is the  awarding of fellowships to support
              scholarly research on India by  senior scientists, postdocs, and graduate
              students.  Applicants  are careful screened and reviewed by panels of eminent
              scientists  at AIIS, and then referred to NSF for disciplinary review and 
              final selection.  The AIIS offices in New Dehli and other major  cities in
              India have well-established contacts with Government of  India departments and
              can facilitate US scientists   collaborations with host institutions.
