Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to document and explain evolutionary changes in
              two critical  features of the early hominid cranio-facial complex: 1) the
              angulation (flexion) of the cranial  base and 2) the position of the face
              relative to the cranial base.  Although it is often assumed that  these
              features evolved together, previous studies have not adequately quantified
              them.  New  measurements of facial positioning and cranial base flexion will be
              collected from original  fossils housed in Kenya and South Africa.  Such
              measurements will improve our understanding  of the pattern of change in these
              key cranial features.  Previous authors have suggested that evolutionary
              changes in flexion and facial positioning are  secondary to changes in the
              shape and relative size of skull components such as the brain and  masticatory
              apparatus. Using comparative samples of modern human and African ape crania, 
              hypotheses relating the overall and relative size of these cranial components
              to variation in  flexion and facial positioning will be tested.  The results of
              this project will aid interpretation of  variation among fossil crania and will
              be especially useful in explaining evolutionary changes  among closely related
              species in our own genus.
