Abstract    :
              Title:   Creating Partnerships between Urban Community College and Industry   
              to Prepare Students to Enter and Succeed in the Technical Workforce    This
              project is planning a national conference to create partnerships between urban
              community colleges and industry to prepare students in urban communities to
              enter and succeed in the technical workforce.  With the increased use of
              technology by corporate America, industry can no longer accept people who lack
              technical skills.  Urban community colleges and their high school partners are
              uniquely positioned to assume a lead role in preparing the workforce necessary
              for industry to remain productive in urban areas.  Partnerships between
              industry, urban based public schools, and community colleges must be
              established that have as a central purpose the preparation of students for
              technical careers and access of students to other careers which depend on use
              of technical information. The conference is involving city major's offices,
              business and industry, the Superintendent of the public schools, and Chancellor
              or President of the community college system in nine major urban cities
              (Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Baltimore, New York, St.
              Louis, and Detroit).  To set an agenda for such a highly visible national
              workshop, a national Steering Committee is being established to lead in
              planning and coordinating the effort.
