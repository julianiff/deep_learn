Abstract    :
              This project connects Gogebic Community College to the Internet over 56 kbps
              lines.  Faculty and students at the school benefit from access to the resources
              of the Internet, including libraries and supercomputers.  In addition, they are
              able to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in
              pursuit of research and educational projects.  The award provides partial
              support of the project for two years.
