Abstract    :
              A medical risk factor is a condition that increases the likelihood that a person
              will contract a  disease.  The term pervades current writing and discussion
              about health, with physicians  incorporating the idea in their daily practice,
              members of the public altering behaviors  in way intended to reduce risk,
              insurers setting rates in accordance with their assessments  of risk, and
              Congress enacting laws and spending funds to alter public exposure to risk
              factors.   In short, the idea of a risk factor has become a real influence in
              current thinking about health and  social behavior.  Yet we know little about
              the origins of this concept, which was formed at the  intersection of
              probability and statistics, public health, and the insurance industry.  We also
              know  little about how it became accepted, then relied upon, by various members
              of society.  To address  these gaps in our knowledge, this project will examine
              the history and current status of the  medical risk factor, with specific
              attention to its application in coronary heart disease, using  as source
              material life insurance archives, specialized journals, popular publications,
              and other  secondary sources.
