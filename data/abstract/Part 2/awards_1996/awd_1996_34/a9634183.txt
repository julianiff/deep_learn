Abstract    :
                  9634183  Perez-Luna    This project will examine the implications of the
              intersection of art, science, and technology as revealed by the events
              occurring around the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the first
              general electronic computer, ENIAC-50.  The finished product will be radio
              programming and audio material that presents the coming together of scientists,
              artists, and other participants in Philadelphia.  It will build on the previous
              research and explorations in both of these fields toward finding commonalties
              and ways in which each has influenced the other.  The finished product will be
              broadcast for the general public and also can be made available to scientists
              and educators in the field as resource material for courses, seminars, and
              lectures as they explore the intersections of science and art and implications
              this has for research and education.
