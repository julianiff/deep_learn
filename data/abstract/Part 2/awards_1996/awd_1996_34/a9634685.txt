Abstract    :
              9634685  Vipulanandan  One  of the biggest problems faced by the U.S. today is 
              the  rehabilitation/replacement of millions of miles of  decaying  underground 
              wastewater pipelines.  The conventional  method  of  open trench construction
              is not only disruptive to urban  life  but  also  costly.  The disruption  and 
              cost  can  be  reduced  by  using  trenchless technology methods  that  are 
              becoming  popular in recent years in the U.S.   One  of  the  most  popular 
              trenchless techniques  is  microtunneling,  a  laser guided, pipe jacking
              process.  For microtunneling, the  pipes must have higher compressive stiffness
              and strength to  avoid  failure during jacking and higher pipe stiffness  and 
              strength  compared  to plastic pipes to  maintain  alignment  during  jacking. 
               In order to satisfy the installation  and  service loading conditions and to
              resist crown corrosion, an  ideal  candidate for underground wastewater 
              pipelines  must  satisfy  the following three criteria:  (1) High compressive 
              stiffness and strength (axial), (2) High pipe stiffness  and  strength 
              (lateral), and (3) Good corrosion resistance.   It  is  planned to develop new
              sandwich pipes that satisfy these  three  criteria.   In order to demonstrate 
              the  concept  of  sandwich  pipe, high corrosion resistant polyvinyl  chloride 
              (PVC)  pipes  are selected as the outer and inner  tubes  to  encase  the 
              filler  materials with good  mechanical  and/or  bonding  properties.  Variety
              of filler materials  including  polymer concrete and cement concrete will be
              investigated.    ***
