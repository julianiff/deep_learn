Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at Michigan State University to
              acquire a CCD area detector  diffractometer. This equipment will enhance
              research in a number of areas including the  following: (1) extended metal
              arrays with paramagnetic centers, (2) electride structures and  properties, (3)
              exploratory synthesis of metal chalcogenide compounds, (4) magneto-structural 
              studies of layered vanadyl phosphates and phosphonates, and (5) reactions of
              transition metal  anions with haloboranes.     The X-ray diffractometer is used
              to make accurate and precise measurements of the full three  dimensional
              structure of a molecule. The information obtained gives the precise values of
              all the  bond distances and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives
              accurate information about the  spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to
              the neighboring molecules.
