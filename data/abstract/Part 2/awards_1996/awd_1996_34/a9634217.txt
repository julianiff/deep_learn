Abstract    :
              9634217  Hu  This project proposes a dynamic threshold MOS (DTMOS) technology
              which will permit CMOS circuits to operate at drain voltages at and below 0.5V.
               Reduction of power supply voltage is critical to low-power operation of scaled
              CMOS circuits.  The DTMOS device is accomplished through and innovative but
              simple silicon on insulator (SOI) technology.  The proposed devices are
              compatible with existing CMOS circuit architectures.  Research is proposed in
              the study of device technology, physics, modeling and electrical
              characterization of test circuits.  ***
