Abstract    :
              9634040  Cohen    This is a grant for partial support of a four-hour Workshop on
              "Management Skills for Scientists," to be held at the 36th annual meeting of
              the American Society for Cell Biology in San Francisco, CA, on December 7,
              1996.  While scientists receive extensive technical training in their specific
              disciplines, they often find themselves at a loss when placed in a position of
              leading a research team.  Lacking the skills required to resolve conflicts,
              understand and channel motivation and foster a team approach, many scientists
              focus exclusively on the technical issues of a project.  While good science may
              be accomplished under such circumstances, the premise of this proposal is that
              familiarity with simple management and team building skills can improve the
              performance of research teams.  The workshop will consist of both a didactic
              and an experiential component.  The principles of team building and management
              will be discussed and illustrated by examples and by workshop participant
              experiences.  The thesis of the workshop is that the funds which are now spent
              on outstanding scientific research projects might be more effectively used if
              scientific work team performance were optimal.  In this sense, the workshop
              directly supports the scientific mission of the NSF by providing scientists
              with a new set of tools to help improve productivity, communication and
              learning.  ***
