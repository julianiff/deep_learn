Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed work is to develop algorithms for  analyzing
              cardiovascular parameters in poultry.  Analysis of  cardiovascular parameters
              will help clarify the underlying  mechanisms which cause Sudden Death Syndrome
              (SDS) and other  economically important diseases in broilers.  SDS, or flipover
              as  it is called in chickens, is increasing in prevalence as a cause  of death
              in broiler populations due, at least in part, to the  control of serious
              infectious diseases and to increases in growth  rates.  It is hypothesized that
              low HRV may be an indicator of  susceptibility to SDS.  lf so, then it may be
              possible to predict  which chicks or embryos are at high risk for SDS.  These
              animals  could then either be culled from the flock before using resources  or
              growing to the point where carcass disposal would be a major  problem or be
              raised under slightly different conditions which  would be more likely to
              result in a viable product.    The  specific objective of the proposed research
              is to  test  the  hypothesis  that  male broilers with low heart  rate 
              variability  (HRV) have a higher incidence of SDS.
