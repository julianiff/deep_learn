Abstract    :
              9634923  William  This project is to assess the deterioration of concrete 
              properties with the aid of ultrasonic wave transmission  techniques.  To this
              end concrete specimens will be  subjected to mechanical load-unload-reload
              histories in  order to initiate stress-induced deterioration processes.  The
              main objective will be to determine whether ultrasonic  measurements lead to
              quantitative damage information on  concrete materials.    The project includes
              theoretical, experimental and  computational research and development along the
              following  directions:         (a) Ultrasonic Wave Transmission Studies in
              Concrete           Specimens       (b) Characterization of Damage       (c)
              Separation of Elastic Degradation and Inelasticity    The project will clarify
              the predictive capabilities of  ultrasonic damage assessment in concrete
              materials.  ***
