Abstract    :
              9634333  Wulf, William  Knight, John  University of Virginia    CISE Educational
              Innovation: Research Integration and Dissemination for Undergraduate Computer
              Science Curriculum.    This CISE Educational Innovation award supports the
              integration of research into the undergraduate curriculum through the
              development of three new upper division courses along with establishment of a
              visiting faculty program and other working relationships with institutions to
              enhance dissemination of the results of the project.  The new courses are in
              the areas of computer aided design, usability engineering, and translation
              systems.  Dissemination will be accomplished through use of the World-Wide Web,
              through special relationships with a selected set of diverse schools, and a
              visiting faculty program in which individual faculty from other institutions
              will be in residence at the University of Virginia campus so as to become
              directly involved in the project and to then transport the material back to
              their home institutions.  Development and dissemination of the new courses has
              the potential to impact curricula widely.
