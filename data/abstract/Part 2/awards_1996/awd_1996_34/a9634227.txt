Abstract    :
              9634227  This award will insure interim preservation of an important  collection
              of mutant stocks of the domestic chicken, many of  which were developed at the
              Davis campus. The chicken has  been an important model system for basic studies
              of  development and immunology, as well as studies with medical  and
              agricultural applications.  In addition to support for  preservation of
              existing stocks, the award will support the  activities of a task force
              convened to develop a long term  plan for preservation of the collection.
