Abstract    :
              9634075  Price    The Center for Education and Equity in Mathematics, Science,
              and Technology at California State Polytechnic University is working with four
              multicultural school districts in eastern Los Angeles County to implement
              systemic change in the secondary mathematics programs.  Teachers in cooperation
              with their administrators are effecting change in mathematics curriculum,
              instruction, and assessment in keeping with the NCTM Standards.  Workshops
              provide teachers with additional content knowledge and renewal of pedagogical
              skills consonant with the selected instructional materials and teachers are
              forming networks and partnerships among themselves, administrators,
              professional societies, and parents.
