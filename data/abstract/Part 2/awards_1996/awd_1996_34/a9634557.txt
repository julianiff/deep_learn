Abstract    :
              The primary focus of this research is to develop a new  mathematical model to
              explain and predict the nontraditional  vibration resonances observed in disk
              drive experiments.  This new mathematical model is agumented to resolve five 
              emerging vibration problems in the disk drive industry. They  include damping,
              forced response, disk/spindle/head  interaction, control of squealing noise,
              and nonlinear fluid-  film bearings. In the past several years, advances in 
              manufacturing and electronic technologies have substantially  increased the
              capacity of computer disk drives by enhancing  the data storage density(e.g.,
              4000 tracks per inch) and by  stacking more disks (e.g., 10 disks) into modern
              disk  drives. In the meantime, the computer industry continues to  reduce the
              size and weight of disk drives by using smaller  and thinner disks mounted on
              spindles with shorter bearing  spans. As a result of these design trends,
              vibration  resonances less than 500 Hz with significant amplitudes have  been
              observed repeatedly in experiments. These vibration  resonances are extremely
              detrimental to their performance,  because their low frequencies and large
              amplitudes prevent  the recording heads from reading or writing the data 
              correctly and repeatedly. This new mathematical model is  more realistic than
              the existing models, because it  considers multiple flexible disks on a rigid
              spindle that  has two flexible bearing supports. The theoretical  predictions
              are verified experimentally through a full-scale  disk drive test rig available
              in the Dynamics and Vibration  Laboratory at the University of Washington.
