Abstract    :
              9634635   Greenwood   This award is for the partial support of a conference to
              be held in Sacramento,  California on May 28-29, 1996.  The conference will
              bring together representatives  from business, local governments and
              universities to develop action plans for the  future of science and technology
              in California based on model  government/university/industry partnerships.  
              The California economy, like that of the  nation, has undergone a major
              transition in recent years.  Large organizations relying  on low wage labor
              have been replaced by small and medium sized companies relying  on a workforce
              requiring continued education and training.  In recognition of those  changes,
              the document Science in the National Interest  set as one of our nations  goals
              the need to "stimulate partnerships that promote investments in fundamental 
              science and engineering."  California, because of it's large and diverse
              economy and  its plethora of research universities, provides an ideal climate
              for developing such  partnerships involving academic, industrial and economic
              development organizations.   Furthermore, California particularly exemplifies
              the successful shift from Cold War  military industries to new areas that
              utilize the skills of those workers, and the  conference will include a
              discussion of successful models for that shift. This  conference may act as a
              model that can be utilized by other regions of the country as  our nation moves
              from a military economy to a civilian economy and as science and  engineering
              are relied on more heavily to be the engines of economic development.  ***
