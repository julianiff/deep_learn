Abstract    :
              9634331  Marshall    This project is a contribution to the program, Methods and
              Models   of Integrated Assessments (MMIA), part of the Global Change   Research
              Program (GCRP).  Pis will exploit observations of   transient tracers,
              Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), and Helium/Tritium   (He/Tr) in the ocean to
              investigate key mechansims that control   the rate at which the ocean
              transports tracers into its interior,   improve the parametric representationof
              those mechanisms in the   models used in climate research, and to assimilate
              tracer data   into a state-of-the-art ocean circulation model to obtain  
              quantitative information about the circulation of the ocean and   the rates of
              gas exchange with the atmosphere.  ***
