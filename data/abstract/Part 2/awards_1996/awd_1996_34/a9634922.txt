Abstract    :
              Abstract  9634922  Glumac    The goal of the proposed investigation is to
              generate a benchmark experimental data set of fully characterized catalytic
              flows in which comprehensive surface chemistry mechanisms for pure metal and
              alloyed catalysts can be refined and validated.  The PI proposes to use a
              stagnation flow environment to create a multispecies post-flame catalytic flow
              field in which measurements can be made and compared with model predictions. 
              Both a low pressure (~10-30 Torr) and a rotating substrate will be used to
              increase transport of gas phase species to the catalyst surface in order to
              achieve strong coupling to surface reactions.  Laser induced fluorescence (LIF)
              will be used to obtain the spatial concentration profiles of a set of key
              reactive species including NO, CO, H, NO2, and OH.  The pure metal unsupported
              catalysts platinum, palladium, and rhodium along with the alloyed and oxide
              supported catalysts will be investigated.  This combination of measurements
              will assist modelers in formulating a mechanism valid for commonly-used
              multicomponent catalyst materials.
