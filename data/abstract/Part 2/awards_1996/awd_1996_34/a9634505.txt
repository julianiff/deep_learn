Abstract    :
                    During the summer of 1995, a joint US-Norwegian-Russian Expedition in the
              Norwegian-Greenland and  Barents Sea discovered a warm gas vent located on an
              ancient fracture zone known as the Hornsund Fault, at great distance from known
              present-day plate boundaries in the region.  The vent was characterized by high
              heat flow, clathrates, H2S, and an unknown species of Pogonophore worm.     
              This award is to return rapidly back to the site, to map in detail, the extent
              of the vent domain using a Russian vessel equipped with side-looking sonar and
              ROV.  In addition, it is to investigate likely sites along the Knipovich Ridge
              for recent hydrothermal activity.    It is believed that the examination of the
              warm gas vents along the margin of the Barents Sea may shed new light on the
              degree of thermal rejuvenation of ancient plate boundaries in the region, and
              the possible role that warn vents in the Arctic region may play on deglaciation
              events, either in modern settings on land (such as Spitsbergen) or in ancient
              glaciated regions, such as the Bear Island Fan.
