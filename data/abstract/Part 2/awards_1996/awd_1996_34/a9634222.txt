Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      Proposal Number: 9634222    Principal Investigator:  Pullin    
              This is a continuation grant to investigate the role of   dynamics and
              kinematics of stretched vortices in describing   the fine scales of turbulence
              with special emphasis on the   relation of the fine and inertial range scales
              to the large   scales in the context of large eddy simulation.  The   research
              will focus on three areas: a) continued development   and testing of an LES
              model of for flows of increasing   complexity, b) completion of the calculation
              of the   longitudinal-velocity structure functions followed by the  
              calculation of other structure functions of other turbulence   quantities such
              as pressure and dissipation, and c)   continuation of supporting research in
              vortex dynamics which   will enhance our understanding of the structure of  
              turbulence.  This is an extension of prior work in which a   standard model  of
              turbulence was developed on the basis of   the stretched vortex model of
              Lundgren.
