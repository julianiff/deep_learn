Abstract    :
              IBN:  9634421  PI:  Wachtel    The overall OBJECTIVE of this project is to
              utilize engineering  based "enabling technologies" to better understand of
              neural (brain)   function.  In particular, we will address the issue of how
              neural sensory   systems are able to detect very weak signals in the presence
              of large   amounts of background "noise".   Our prototype will be the
              electroreceptive   systems of sharks, (who are able to detect an electric field
              equivalent to   a 1.5 volt "flashlight battery" placed across the Atlantic
              Ocean!)  The   possible mechanisms by which this exquisite sensory system
              operates will be   explored using technologies such as Interactive Computer
              Simulation and   Digital Signal Processing models adapted from electrical and
              computer   engineering venues.    The SIGNIFICANCE of this project will extend
              far beyond  understanding how sharks detect very weak electric fields. First of
              all, it   will allow us to demonstrate how "engineering based" technologies can
              be   usefully deployed in studying the nervous system.  Such technologies may  
              play a vital role, during and after the "decade of the brain", in helping   us
              understand how the brain operates as an information detector and   processor. 
              In addition to its fundamental value in neurobiology, such an   understanding
              could lead to the evolution of improved computers -   particularly those based
              on "neural network" designs.  The ability to   detect and interpret weak
              signals is also of vital importance in developing   advanced communication
              systems and understanding the way "nature" has been   accomplishing this for
              millions of years is likely to be extremely   relevant.
