Abstract    :
              9634736  Magnanti   This research involves the development of solution methods
              for solving finite dimensional fixed point and variational inequality problems.
               The goals of this project are to create and study algorithms that are able to
              solve broader classes of problems than the current state-of-the-art and to
              accelerate the convergence of "inefficient" algorithms.  New solution methods
              based on a general theory of averaging will be investigated; these include
              averaging schemes with the identity map, averaging schemes with contractive
              maps and path following methods, general averaging using resolvents,
              component-wise averaging, and averaging relative to a potential.  The
              investigators will apply their results on averaging to devise efficient
              algorithms for the traffic assignment problem and in computing economic
              equilibria.    Fixed point and variational inequality problems are pervasive in
              the fields of engineering, economics and operations research.  They arise in
              such diverse areas as differential equations, game theory, optimization,
              decision analysis, and extreme value theory, to name a few.  This research
              holds the potential for significant advances in both the theory and
              computational solution of this class of problems.  It builds an important
              foundation for the analysis of network equilibria.  In engineering, it should
              ultimately find useful applications in the design and operation of
              transportation and telecommunications networks.
