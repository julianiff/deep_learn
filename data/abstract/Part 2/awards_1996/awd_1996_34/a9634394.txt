Abstract    :
              9634394  O'Sullivan   Transport from the tropics to the extratropics in the
              stratosphere occurs mainly by isentropic advection and stirring into the active
              surf zone of the winter hemisphere midlatitudes.  The transport couples two
              regions of differing constituent concentrations:  the (upwelling) tropical
              region and the (mostly downwelling) extratropics.   Besides varying seasonally,
              such transport is affected by the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO).  The
              principal objective of this research is to investigate the manner in which the
              QBO affects transport by (a) its mean meridional circulations, (b) its
              modulation of Rossby wave propagation and breaking at the low latitudes, (c)
              its modulation of the extratropical Rossby wave activity and surf zone mixing,
              and consequently (d) its modulation of the global Brewer-Dobson residual
              circulation strength during the winter season.  The study will rely primarily
              on numerical simulations with a three-dimensional model of the middle
              atmosphere and a tracer transport model.  The results will be compared with
              other simulations and satellite observations of the middle atmosphere.  This
              work will also provide estimates of stratospheric transport rates form the
              tropics to the extratropics for each season and for different phases of the QBO
              as a function of height.   Dr. O'Sullivan is a young scientist who has
              established an excellent reputation in the middle atmosphere research
              community.  His work is contributes not only to better understanding of
              stratospheric dynamics, but also provides critical information on processes
              that affect the photochemical processes of the region as well.  ***
