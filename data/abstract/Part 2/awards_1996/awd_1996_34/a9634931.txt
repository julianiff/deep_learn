Abstract    :
              Chun  DMI-9634931    Droplet deposition is fundamental to droplet-based
              manufacturing (DBM) processes.  The challenge of this technique has been the
              simultaneous control of both geometry and microstructure during the direct
              manufacturing of a part drom the molten state.  This research project will
              develop a high-precision and uniform-droplet deposition system to investigate
              deposition phenomena, including microscale process monitoring of the droplet
              thermal state and impact dynamics, microstructure evolution and modeling, and
              evaluation of spray deposits. This is a collaborative research project between
              the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Northeastern University.  The
              research project has a balance between theory and experiment, and will provide
              valuable findings for the rapid prototyping industry.
