Abstract    :
              This award made in the Office of Special Projects deals with the design,  
              synthesis and characterization of metal coordination complexes and   networks
              with interesting magnetic properties. Emphasis will be on the   synthesis of
              arylene and polyarylene rings bearing two or three o-quinone   or semiquinone
              structures which, depending on their oxidation state will   be paramagnetic and
              capable of binding to high-spin octahedral transition   metals. In the
              semiquinone state, the ligands will be radical anions so   that their metal
              complexes will not require any supporting counterions.   The resulting 
              neutral, three dimensional complexes and networks will   exhibit strong
              coupling in three dimensions and should exhibit bulk   magnetism. The ligands
              and complexes will be characterized by cyclic   voltammetry, electron
              paramagnetic resonance, crystallography and   magnetometry.  Organic molecular
              magnets are an area of high academic as well as   technological interest.
              Success of this project will advance the   fundamental understanding of the
              molecular basis for magnetism.   Additionally, air-stable, light weight organic
              magnets will find numerous   commercial applications ranging from small
              electric motors to information   storage.
