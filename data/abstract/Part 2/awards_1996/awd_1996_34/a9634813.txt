Abstract    :
              9634813  Peshkin   Assistive devices aid in maneuvering subcomponents with
              safety and ergonomic benefit, thereby reducing worker strain and fatigue during
              assembly operations.   However, these devices usually reduce freedom of motion
              and dexterity.  This Grant Opportunity  for Academic Liaison with Industry
              cooperative research project between Northwestern University and General Motors
              will investigate programmable constraint machines as assistive devices for
              assembly, promising to retain dexterity and freedom of motion.  Programmable
              constraint machines use sensors and control methods to provide two modes of
              operation: a free or "castering" mode where essentially unconstrained motion is
              possible for moving subassemblies into position, and a constrained or "wall"
              mode where a software barrier or guide is used to move a subassembly into
              prescribed position. Programmed constraint devices do not servo an assembly
              into position, so they are essentially passive devices that rely on the human
              operator's dexterity and the use of these software guides to ease the assembly
              task.  This cooperative project will result in half scale prototype devices and
              full scale implementation at the General Motors Assembly Center.     This
              project will advance theoretical and applied research in the areas of robotics
              and assembly.  The potential impact of this research on improved worker safety
              will lead to productivity and cost benefits.
