Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9634754  Geoffrey L. Price      Cu-exchanged zeolites (MFI and
              Beta) will be characterized by chemisorption, TPD, TPR, IR, and EXAFS/XANES. 
              The mechanisms and kinetics of reactions of amines to nitriles and imines
              oligomers and isomers will be studied over those catalysts.  The role of the
              various types of oxides and oxidation states of Cu, the zeolite structures, the
              amine structure, and the presence or absence of hydrogen gas, will be
              identified, with the objective of better characterizing the catalytic
              properties of these materials.
