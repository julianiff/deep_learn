Abstract    :
              Professor Nan Laird of Harvard University will be the principal speaker  at a
              conference on longitudinal data analysis.  Prof. Laird will deliver  a series
              of lectures and prepare a monograph based on these lectures.  Because of its
              wide appeal and importance in applications, longitudinal  data analysis has
              become an intense area of statistical research.  Prof.  Laird has been on the
              forefront of development since the early 1980's,  both in methodology and
              application.  In addition, a number of other  noted researchers in the field
              will be invited to participate.  The  conference is tentatively scheduled to be
              held at the University of  Missouri-Columbia, June 3-8.
