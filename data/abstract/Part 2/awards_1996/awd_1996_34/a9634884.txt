Abstract    :
              9634884  Clarke   This minority research planning grant focuses on research for
              developing decision models for integrated production and distribution planning
              in large manufacturing companies, characterized by multiple plants that are
              geographically dispersed, multiple products that can be produced at different
              locations, multiple period planning horizons, significant
              transportation-shipping costs, and intermediate tiers of distribution and
              supply.  The decision support integrated production and planning system must
              determine (1) which product to produce at which plant, (2) what quantity to
              produce each period, (3) where to hold inventory, (4) from which plants will a
              customer receive shipment, (5) what route and what mode of transportation will
              the shipment take. The methodology focuses on mixed integer programming. 
              During the planning year, a particular application from the gas industry will
              be studied, an extensive literature review undertaken, some preliminary
              formulations will be developed.   The research problem addressed is important
              and interesting.  Given the broad scope of the problem addressed, a planning
              grant is most appropriate to allow the PI to investigate the area  in more
              detail so that a focused proposal can result.
