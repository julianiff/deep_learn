Abstract    :
              9634713  Russo  Entanglement of rodlike polymers will be investigated by
              diffusion measurements  on model rods in binary solutions, liquid crystals,
              ternary mixtures with other  polymers, and dispersions in permanent, inflexible
              gels. The methods to be  employed include dynamic light scattering,
              fluorescence photobleaching recovery  and analytical ultracentrifugation. 
              These studies will illuminate the effects  of molecular shape on entanglement,
              which is an important determinant of the  processibility of rodlike polymers. 
              By comparison to an extensive literature  on entanglement in random flight
              polymers, the effects of molecular rigidity  can be realized.  This proposed
              work also bears on the nature of molecular  composite precursor solutions and
              on anisotropic diffusion in polymer liquid  crystals, while illuminating how
              matrix topography governs diffusion.  %%%  This grant falls in the area of
              molecular-level understanding of polymer  molecules in various processing
              environments, such as solutions, blends, gels,  etc., with emphasis on
              rigid-rod molecules such as liquid crystals.  ***
