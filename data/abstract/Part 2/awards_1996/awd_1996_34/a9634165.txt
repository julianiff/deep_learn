Abstract    :
              9634165  INCZE  Recent studies indicate that interannual differences in 
              circulation processes can substantially impact retention and  recruitment of
              fish eggs and larvae on Georges Bank.  Strong year  classes of cod and haddock
              are hypothesized to be associated with  a relatively high degree of retention
              on the Bank.  This project  will undertake an interdisciplinary field study
              along the  southern flank of Georges Bank, as part of the U.S. GLOBEC 
              Northwest Atlantic Field Studies Phase II program,  to clarify  the relative
              importance of dispersive and advective processes  affecting retention/loss,
              feeding, growth rates and nutritional  conditions of larval cod and haddock.
              The project implements a  three-dimensional circulation model that will be used
              in near  real-time to conduct the field program. A hindcasting model will  be
              utilized to integrate physical and biological observations in  coupled
              circulation-trophodynamic simulations.    ***
