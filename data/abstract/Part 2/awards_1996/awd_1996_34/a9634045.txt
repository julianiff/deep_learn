Abstract    :
              9634045  Tardif   This GOALI proposal is for the PI to spend three summer months
              with Schlumberger Austin Research working in the area of finite-capacity
              scheduling and diagnostics.  She will be working directly with the End-to End
              Simulation group in developing the diagnostic tool.  The project has two main
              goals.  The first is to tailor MRP-C to facilitate its implementation at a few
              key manufacturing facilities.  Special attention will be given to the modeling
              of yield loss in order to capture potential correlation between cycle time and
              the number of defective items produced.  The second goal is to encourage
              managers and production schedulers to use MRP-C in their daily planning and to
              assess its impact on decision-making and on-time delivery performance.  The
              study will provide a great opportunity to determine the information needed by
              managers and schedulers to make and justify decisions and the desired format
              for such information.  It will make possible investigation of more systematic
              and graphical ways to represent alternative schedules.  The availability of
              advanced computer equipment and technical support at Schlumberger research labs
              and manufacturing plants makes it an ideal site to develop and implement new
              procedures which rely heavily on computers and information technology.   The
              relationship of the PI and her industrial partner, Schlumberger, should greatly
              benefit her career.  Her proposal is well thought out and has high potential
              for making a real impact on industry.  The synergistic effect of this
              academic-industry relationship should prove very productive.
