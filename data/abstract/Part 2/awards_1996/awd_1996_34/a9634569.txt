Abstract    :
              9634569  Stephanopoulos  This proposal is on research to elucidate the control
              of  flux in the central carbon metabolic pathway of  Corynebacterium
              glutamicum.  The three branch points of  glucose-6-phosphate,
              phosphoenol-pyruvate and pyruvate will  be specifically investigated as they
              are deemed critical in  determining flux distribution between anabolic and
              catabolic  functions.  The approach that will be followed is to: (1)  establish
              the fundamental genetic and biochemical  characteristics of key enzymes at the
              above branch points,  such as pyruvate carboxylase, glucose-6-phosphate 
              dehydrogenase and phosphofructokinase, respectively, and (2)  to reconstruct
              measured in-vivo metabolic fluxes from the  kinetic and regulatory properties
              of the individual enzymes.  Genetic modifications will be employed as needed in
              order to  provide appropriate genetic background in the research, or  to
              implement specific designs for flux amplifications.  The  research will employ
              a state of the art genetic toolbox for  C. glutamicum, metabolic flux analysis
              for in-vivo flux  determination using material balancing and radioactive 
              carbon thirteen compound labeling, and biochemical assays in  properly designed
              chemostat experiments.  The investigation  of fundamental determinants of flux
              distribution in  metabolic networks will be concluded with coordinated 
              multienzyme modifications aiming at productivity and yield  enhancement of
              amino acid production, and overproduction of  the preserved food flavor
              enhancer trehalose in C.  glutamicum fermentations.  ***
