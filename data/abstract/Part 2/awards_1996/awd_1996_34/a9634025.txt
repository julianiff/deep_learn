Abstract    :
              9634025  Branca    This fifty-seven month Local Systemic Change in Mathematics
              (LSCM) project, which builds on and joins the Middle Grades Mathematics
              Renaissance and the California Mathematics Project, provides teacher
              enhancement for 2,000 teachers of mathematics in grades K-12 in 16 clusters in
              four regions of California.  The cluster, defined by a high school and its
              feeder middle and elementary schools, is the unit of participation in the
              project.  From each school in the cluster, each secondary teacher of
              mathematics receives a minimum of 130 hours of professional development over
              the life of the project and each elementary teacher receives a minimum of 100
              hours.  Algebra -- algebra for all, algebraic thinking throughout the K-12
              curriculum -- is the center of the mathematical work.  As districts make their
              adoption decisions from a defined menu of high quality instructional materials
              (both NSF-supported and others), the project assists teachers in the
              implementation of comprehensive materials.     This initiative will develop a
              model for K-12 articulation and will inform educators on the process of
              articulating a coherent K-12 program of professional development and
              instruction.  Linkages are forged among schools engaged in mathematics reform,
              California Mathematics Project (CMP) sites, and university mathematicians. 
              Estimated cost-sharing from CMP, local school districts, and the San Diego
              University Foundation is approximately $ 3.86 million.
