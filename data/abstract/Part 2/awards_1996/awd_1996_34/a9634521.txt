Abstract    :
              9634521  Hennage    The Optical Society of America requests a grant in the
              amount of $5,000  from the National Science Foundation for the support of the
              1996  Diffractive Optics and Micro-Optics Topical Meeting, to be held April 
              28-May 3, 1996, in Boston, Massachusetts.  This grant request is to support 
              partial travel of students and young faculty to attend this important  meeting.
                 This meeting was last held in 1994 in Rochester, New York and about 16% of 
              the participants were students. This year the meeting will be held jointly 
              with four other topical meetings (Integrated Photonics Research,  Holography,
              Optical Fabrication and Testing, and Extreme Ultraviolet  Lithography).    The
              Diffractive Optics Topical Meeting made its debut in New Orleans in  1992. The
              meeting was held again in 1994 in Rochester, New York. The aim of  this meeting
              is to bring together scientists and engineers of various  backgrounds to
              discuss new developments in the various aspects of  diffractive and refractive
              micro-optics.    Diffractive optics and micro-optics are continuing to find new
              and  interesting applications. These optical elements provide the potential to 
              reduce significantly the size, weight, and cost of a variety of optical 
              systems. In addition, diffractive and refractive micro-optics can be  combined
              to provide unique system properties.    Some of the topic areas to be discussed
              are:    * Design & Analysis of Diffractive & Micro-Optics Optical Elements  *
              Fabrication & Replication of Diffractive Micro-Optics Optical Elements  *
              Dynamic Diffractive/Micro-Optics Optical Elements  * Applications & New
              Products  ***
