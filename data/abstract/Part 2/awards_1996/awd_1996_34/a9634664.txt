Abstract    :
              Gurevitch  DEB-9634664  This study will investigate the critical initial phase
              of regeneration on the Long Island Pine Barrens following a fire in August 1995
              which burned almost 7,000 acres.  Pine barrens are well-studied systems, but
              little is known about the conditions which lead to pine or oak dominated
              communities in the barrens.  It is anticipated that events in the early years
              following the fire will be crucial in determining community composition. 
              Experiments will be established which investigate the relative importance of
              biotic and abiotic factors and how these factors interact.  Particular
              attention will be paid to the importance of seed and seedling predation by
              small mammals and competition among tree seedlings in determining the
              trajectory of revegetation of the pine barrens following a catastrophic fire. 
              Revegetation of the dwarf pine plains, a globally rare ecosystem located within
              the Long Island pine barrens, will be compared with that of the burned (full
              stature) pine barrens.  Data on the response of dwarf and normal pine barrens
              to severe following long-term fire suppression will help our assessment of fire
              management options, including controlled burns, for pine barrens newly
              protected by the Pine Barrens Protection Act of 1995.
