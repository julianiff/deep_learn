Abstract    :
              Rauber/Abstract  ATM-9634660            The goal of this proposal is to develop
              a physically consistent  understanding of the evolution of rain in warm
              tropical clouds.  Our  proposed research involves:  1)  the evaluation of
              hypotheses concerning  the initiation of coalescence; 2) the assessment of the
              importance of  environmental influences, such as vertical shear and
              entrainment, on the   evolution of rain following the development of the first
              precipitation  embryos;  3) the determination of the mechanism governing the 
              formation of very large raindrops in shallow warm cumulous;  4)  the 
              characterization of cloud microphysical processes in terms of the  equivalent
              radar reflectivity factor;  and 5)  the determination of the  dynamical
              mechanisms responsible for the formation and rapid  intensification of Hawaiian
              rainbands.  Our studies include the analysis of  data from three field
              projects, the joint Hawaiian Warm rainbands.  Our  studies include the analysis
              of data from three field projects, the Joint  Hawaiian Warm Rain Project, the
              Hawaiian Rainband Project, and the small  Cumulus Microphysics  Experiment. 
              The proposed research also includes  modeling studies using the Clark model,
              and Lagrangian trajectory models  applied within kinematic fields from both the
              Clark model and Doppler  radar data.
