Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:  CTS-9634120  PI:  Mei     This is a study of a
              range of problems that are of interest to the field of coastal engineering.  
              The common feature of the problems under study is that they have several
              contrasting length or time scales.  Asymptotic and numerical analysis as well
              as experimental investigations are being used to investigate the underlying
              physics.  The problems under investigation are: a) Effects of surface waves on
              the resuspension and transport of very fine sediments, b) Wave induced
              formation of sand ripples and bars, c) Long-period harbor oscillations induced
              by narrow banded short waves, and d) Subharmonic resonance of waves trapped in
              an array of vertical cylinders.   The subject of fine sediment erosion and
              transportation in shallow water bodies is an important problem with serious
              environmental implications.  The study of long period oscillations and
              subharmonic resonance of waves in an array of cylinders are of importance to
              the design of harbor facilities.  All four topics have an experimental and a
              theoretical component.
