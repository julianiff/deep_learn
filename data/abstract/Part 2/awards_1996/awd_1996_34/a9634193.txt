Abstract    :
              ***  Michalowski  9634193  There has been an increase in interest in reinforced
              soil structures following the major seismic events in the U.S. and in Japan in
              the last few years. Reinforced soil structures appear to have performed very
              well during earthquakes, and showed little structural distress.    This project
              addresses the stability analysis of such structures. Both soil nailing and
              geosynthetic reinforcement are considered, and seismic loads, given as patterns
              of base acceleration, are accounted for.    Two major objectives are: (a)
              progress in understanding of soil reinforcement mechanisms, including some
              "non-traditional" synthetic reinforcement such as thin continuous filament, and
              (b) development of techniques for analysis and synthesis of soil structures
              reinforced with soil nails or geosynthetics, and presenting results in a manner
              useful for design practice.    The analysis is based on the theorems of
              plasticity theory. The contribution of soil nails or geosynthetics are
              accounted for through inclusion of additional work dissipation terms in the
              energy balance equation. An effort is made to investigate the influence of
              non-associativity of plastic flow of granular soils on the results of the
              stability analysis. The structural loads considered include self-weight, forces
              applied as boundary loads, and inertial forces due to seismic acceleration
              (base shaking).    This research will contribute to the state of knowledge in
              the area through development of a new analysis for stability of soil-nailed or
              geosynthetic-reinforced structures, and through development of a new approach
              to modeling of soils reinforced with continuous thread (filament). It will also
              contribute to engineering design practice. An effort will be made to create
              useful design charts.
