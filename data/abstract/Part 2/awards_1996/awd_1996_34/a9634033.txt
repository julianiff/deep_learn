Abstract    :
              During the period 1968-1974, certain American scientists challenged the existing
              relationship between science and the state.  In raising ethical questions
              concerning the funding of research for military projects and those of
              questionable social value, from the development of hi-tech weaponry to debates
              over genetic engineering, these scientists viewed science as an inherently
              political activity.  This dissertation research examines the experiences and
              motivations of the `radical` scientists who held this worldview as well as
              those factors -- religious, intellectual, and political -- that contributed to
              the emergence of a radical science movement.  Using various nonviolent
              strategies to affect change within the existing establishment of American
              science, these scientists sought to reformulate the ideology and ethos of
              science and its institutions.  This research will explore the historical
              context of the movement to probe important ethical issues involved in the
              radical scientists' critique of the existing scientific establishment and its
              relations to government, industry, and society, and in the radical scientists'
              perception of and interaction with contemporary social movements.  By
              investigating this heretofore overlooked aspect of American radicalism, the
              study will contribute to a richer understanding of how these scientists
              introduced a new vision of the ethical relation of science to society that
              continues to shape debates concerning science and values today.
