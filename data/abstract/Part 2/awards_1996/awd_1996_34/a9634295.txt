Abstract    :
                This project will analyze the process of translating scientific data into the
              formation and execution of environmental policies. It takes the socio-political
              responses and management of Chilean fisheries as a case study from which to
              extract more general relationships of human adaptations to climate change.  As
              a result of the increase in the accuracy of predictive capabilities and the
              wider distribution of probabilistic forecast efforts for El Ni(o Southern
              Oscillation (ENSO) events, the interaction between scientists and policy makers
              has become more direct. The project will provide a better understanding of the
              structural and functional links involved in this process. This knowledge will
              contribute valuable information to three key groups involved in the
              policy-making process: (1) scientists involved in producing forecast products;
              (2) governmental and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) who have been
              mandated (e.g. U.N. Conference on Environment and Development, 1992) to
              disseminate these forecast tools; and (3) policy makers in sub-national,
              national and supra-national arenas who use this information in planning
              mitigation and development strategies and treatises.  In collaboration with a
              US and Chilean research team representing fisheries biology, environmental law
              and policy analysis and marine anthropology (funded by NOAA-Office of Global
              Programs under the title `Adaptations of the Fishing Sectors to the Impacts of
              El Ni(o Climate Variations: The Case of Chile`), the project will analyze the
              relationships among the societies and processes which result in decision
              making.  This timely project will contribute to a greater understanding of a
              range of information variables situated within a framework of diverse
              political, economic and cultural norms and values.
