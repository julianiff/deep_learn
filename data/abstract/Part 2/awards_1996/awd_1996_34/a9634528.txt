Abstract    :
              9634528  Novak  This  grant is directed torward finding more direct methods  of 
              synthesizing  useful  polymers  from  inexpensive,  new  monomers. 
              Specifically, the PI will focus on the synthesis  of   poly(vinyl  alcohol) 
              (PVOH),  PVOH  derivatives,  and  poly(vinyl  amine)  (PVAm)  derivatives  from
                enols   and  enamines,  respectively.  One goal  of  this  work  is  the 
              conversion of acetaldehyde to PVOH, which de facto, is  the  synthesis  of PVOH
              from ethylene and oxygen.  The synthetic  approach   involves  circumventing 
              inherent  thermodynamic  limitations  by  approaching  conundrums  from  a  
              kinetic  perspective.   From this vantage point, many  thermodynamic  problems
              can be transformed into competitive rate problems,  and  hence,  remedied
              through chemistry  (e.g.,  catalysis,  conditions, etc.).  In the context of
              this proposal,  enols  (e.g., vinyl alcohol, and its substituted derivatives)
              will  be  rapidly  generated  under  meta-stable  conditions  and  polymerized 
              at a rate faster than they can tautomerize  to  the  more  thermodynamically
              stable aldehyde.   Alternative  enols will also be generated by the catalytic
              isomerization  of  allyl  alcohol  derivatives to the corresponding  enols 
              using homogeneous Rh(I), Ir(I), and Ru(II) catalysts.  %%%  Synthesis of
              important polymers from common and inexpensive  sources,   in  particular  on 
              synthesis  of  water-soluble  polymers  used in applications ranging from
              pharmaceuticals  to low VOC paints.  ***
