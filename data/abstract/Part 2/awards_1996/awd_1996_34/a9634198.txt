Abstract    :
              This award is made jointly by the Office of Special Projects in Chemistry   and
              the Solid State Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials   Research in
              support of the continuing research of Dr. Kathy Rowlen at the   University of
              Colorado-Boulder. The research relates the atomic level   structure of thin
              metal films to their morphology, optical, and   electrical properties.
              Specifically, the morphology of copper, silver and   gold films supported on
              silica, silicon, mica, and alumina will be   characterized using atomic force
              microscopy and surface enhanced Raman   spectroscopy. Issues that will be
              addressed are: (1) influence of   substrate on film morphology; (2) film
              thermal stability as a function of   substrate; (3) in situ measurement of
              optical properties under film   growth conditions; (4) spatial distribution of
              of metal deposition by   photoinduced reduction as a probe for hot electrons in
              semiconductors;   and, (5) application of enhanced electromagnetic fields near
              metal   particles for improved solar conversion efficiency in Schottky barrier 
               solar cells. Adhesion of film to substrate, and the kinetics of particle  
              coalesence will also be investigated.  A fundamental understanding of the
              nature of thin metal films deposited   on non-metal surfaces will benefit a
              variety of technologies including   printed circuitry, interconnects,
              integrated circuits and photovoltaic   devices.
