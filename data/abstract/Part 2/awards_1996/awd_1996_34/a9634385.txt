Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  DMS-9634385    The migration and fate of nonaqueous phase liquid
              (NAPL) organic contaminants in the subsurface has been the subject of intensive
              investigation in the past few years.  It is now generally recognized that the
              prevalence of NAPLs at contaminated sites is a significant impediment to
              aquifer restoration.  Based upon the perceived limitations of conventional
              pump-and-treat methods for aquifer remediation, considerable interest is
              currently focused on the development of alternative remediation strategies. One
              of these alternative strategies is surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation
              (SEAR).  There are three outstanding problems related to the design of
              successful SEAR projects.  First, relatively little attention has been focused
              on the mathematical modeling of fluid flow in SEAR.  Secondly, because of the
              limited sampling over the spatial extent of an aquifer, fluid flow and
              transport models will necessarily have large uncertainty in the presence of
              heterogeneity.  Thirdly, the very large computations involved in simulation of
              the SEAR process require algorithms that are both reliable and efficient.   
              Because of the complexities involved in the SEAR process, the proposed research
              will bring together the expertise from several disciplines, namely geosciences
              research, petroleum engineering and applied mathematics.  The investigators
              propose to develop models and numerical algorithms to simulate the initial
              dispersal of organic contaminants and later cleanup by means of' surfactant
              floods. These numerical algorithms will employ complex multi-phase flow models,
              state-of-the-art geostatistical methods and modem numerical techniques such as
              adaptive mesh refinement, dynamic upscaling of physical properties and
              object-oriented programming.  The computations will be performed on
              workstations, and on supercomputers employing parallel processing.  Graphical
              user interfaces and interactive visualization techniques will be developed.
