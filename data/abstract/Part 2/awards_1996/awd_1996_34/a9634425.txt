Abstract    :
              9634425  Long, Tim  Sitaraman, Murali  Ohio State University/West Virginia
              University    CISE Educational Innovation:  Development and Dissemination of a
              New Undergraduate Course Sequence in Software Design and Development    This
              CISE Educational Innovation award supports the integration of research into the
              undergraduate curriculum through the development and dissemination of a new
              sequence in software design and development.  The project is a joint effort
              between Ohio State University and West Virginia University, with OSU as the
              lead institution.    The project involves the design, development,
              installation, and evaluation of an innovative three-quarter sequence in
              software design and development.  The sequence is integrated and unified in its
              philosophical and technical bases.  A major part of the effort includes the
              development of a software composition workbench consisting of an integrated set
              of software tools.  The workbench will be capable of guiding students and
              software developers in their application of the methodologies taught in the
              course sequence and it will instill in software developers a particular mental
              model of software and how to construct it.  Dissemination will be facilitated
              through training workshops for visiting faculty from a number of other
              institutions.  The total project is supported in part also by the Fund for
              Improvement of Secondary Education (FIPSE) in the Department of Education.
