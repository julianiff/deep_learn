Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to characterize the dependence of optimal
              near-term decisions about policies to abate global climate change on two
              potentially important factors that have received inadequate attention in
              current integrated-assessment efforts: (1) selection of the evaluation endpoint
              and parametric form of the damage function (relating economic losses to climate
              change), and (2) decision making about adaptation to reduce damages.  The
              analysis will use a combination of analytic and integrated-assessment models to
              evaluate the effects of changes in these factors on optimal greenhouse-gas
              emission paths and to develop an understanding of the reasons for these
              effects.  The Harvard Center for Risk Analysis (HCRA) Integrated Assessment
              Model will be used for exploratory modeling.  Compared with other integrated
              assessment models, the HCRA model is relatively simple and flexible,
              characteristics which permit rapid modification to incorporate new
              specifications and solutions for optimal greenhouse-gas emission trajectories. 
               The results of this research should provide an initial understanding of the
              importance for climate-abatement policy of variations in the choice of endpoint
              and/or damage function and the magnitude and control of opportunities for
              adaptation.  Exploration of the effect of these factors will provide
              information about the importance of including them in other integrated
              assessment activities and will help to suggest which aspects warrant greatest
              attention.
