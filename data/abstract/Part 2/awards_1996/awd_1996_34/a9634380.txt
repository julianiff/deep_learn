Abstract    :
              The last decade has seen extraordinary technological, intellectual, and market 
              developments that have shifted many assumptions underlying research in computer
               architecture.  Promising avenues for future research will doubtless lead in 
              directions different from those of the past.  This project will convene a group
               of approximately 15 experts from industry and academe, who will discuss this
              and  related issues in a one-day workshop.  The proposed date is May 21, 1996,
              the day  before the start of the ACM/IEEE international Computer Architecture
              Symposium  to be held in Philadelphia, PA.  The product of the workshop will be
              a final  report published on the World Wide Web.
