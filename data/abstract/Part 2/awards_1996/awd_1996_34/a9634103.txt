              Research Center (I/UCRC) has an evaluator associated with the Center to study
              the industry/university interaction occurring within the Center.  This
              information is of interest to both the I/UCRC Program and the Center Director
              as well as providing a data base to be used by researchers studying Centers.   
              This award provides funding to study the industry/university interaction
              occurring in Case Western Reserve University's Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for Applied Polymers.    The evaluator will conduct
              investigations of Center activities, participate in annual meetings, attend the
              NSF evaluator activities, and interview departing companies.
