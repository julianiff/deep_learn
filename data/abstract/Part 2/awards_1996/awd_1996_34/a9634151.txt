Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to develop the Chesapeake Bay Virtual Environment (CBVE), which
              will fuse 3D visualizations of numerically generated data into a large-scale,
              interactive virtual world.  This modeling framework will incorporate runtime
              computational steering, interactive visualization, data ensonification , and
              wide area information dissemination capabilities.  CBVE will support technology
              transfer, provide mentoring in coastal ecosystem science, and serve as a medium
              for information exchange by taking advantage of Internet-based media and
              complete World-Wide Web functionality.  The use of  a virtual world as a new
              paradigm of information exchange coupled with a World-Wide Web based
              information architecture will allow multidisciplinary, multi-institutional
              groups of scientists, educators, students and administrators to apply emerging
              high performance computing and communications technologies to the study of the
              country's largest estuarine ecosystem.  CBVE will initially couple a working 3D
              circulation model of the Chesapeake Bay and adjoining shelf with working
              biological models for larvae of two commercially important species in
              Chesapeake Bay, the Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tryannuas) and the blue Crab
              (Callinectes sapidus).  The ultimate goal is visualization of the entire model
              output in an immersive, interactive environment.
