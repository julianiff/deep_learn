Abstract    :
              9634718  McMahon    It is proposed to carry out an experimental study of the 
              mechanisms of diffusion-controlled intergranular brittle  fracture in model
              iron-and copper-based alloys using  bicrystals with symmetrical tilt
              boundaries.  Previous  research has been carried out on polycrystalline
              materials,  and these suffer from limitations that preclude a  quantitative
              test of the model proposed for this phenomenon,  which we believe is a unique
              and generic form of brittle  fracture.  The reasons for using bicrystals are
              the  following:  First, the cracking rate should be proportional  to the
              grain-boundary diffusivity of the embrittling element  (which is hypothesized
              to diffuse in from a free surface  under the influence of  an applied stress,
              as in diffusion  creep).  In a bicrystal the diffusivity can be held constant 
              in a given direction, and the diffusion direction can be  varied so as to
              obtain a fixed and measurable ratio of  diffusivities, and therefore
              crack-growth rates.  Second,  the fractured bicrystal will present a large flat
              fracture  surface on which high-resolution scanning electron  microscopy and
              atomic-force microscopy measurements can be  made of the intervals of cracking
              in what is likely a step-  wise process.  Third, the crack-tip stress field
              should be  constant along the crack tip and along the crack path, at  least in
              the central portion of the specimen; it is this  stress field that is
              postulated to drive the diffusion and  therefore the crack extension by
              decohesion.  %%%  These research will establish in a fundamental way the 
              mechanisms of diffusion-controlled intergranular brittle  fracture, which could
              be a common, but unrecognized form of  failure in engineering materials.  ***
