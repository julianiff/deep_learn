              Educational Innovation:  Mainstreaming Parallel and Distributed Computing in
              the Computer Science Undergraduate Curriculum    This CISE Educational
              Innovation project incorporates the latest research in parallel and distributed
              computing into core courses in the undergraduate computer science curriculum. 
              It introduces students to important concepts in these areas and demonstrates
              both theoretically and practically their usefulness in a wide variety of
              application areas.  The basic parallel and distributed computing concepts are
              integrated into several existing courses including those on simulation,
              computer vision, operating systems, numerical analysis and databases. 
              Investigators from Research Centers at the University, including the centers on
              Database Systems, Computer Vision and Visualization, Software Engineering, and
              Parallel Computing are involved in this Educational Innovation Project.
