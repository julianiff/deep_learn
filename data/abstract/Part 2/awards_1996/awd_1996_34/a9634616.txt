Abstract    :
              Harwood  9634616    Abstract    Information derived from the study of fossil
              plants, animals, and  protists provides valuable data on age and
              paleoenvironment in  geological studies.  Paleontologists are actively studying
              the  stratigraphic record of evolution and environmental change in the 
              Southern Ocean and Antarctic area, in order to address questions  regarding
              climate change associated with the development of the  Antarctic Ice Sheet more
              than 40 million years ago and the  response of life to progressive cooling and
              ice sheet advance and  retreat.  Many gaps exist within the geologic record. 
              Recent and  future efforts are targeted at filling some of the major gaps 
              through stratigraphic drilling.  The Cape Roberts Project (CRP)  is the most
              recent drilling effort, with a target to recover a  record from 100 to 30
              million years ago.  This will build on  recent drilling efforts on the margin
              of the Victoria Land Basin  (CIROS & MSSTS) and in the Southern Ocean by the
              Ocean Drilling  Program (ODP).  The new CRP initiative will focus on the early 
              history of ice sheets in East Antarctica and the conditions there  prior to the
              development of the ice sheet, when this region was  much warmer.  A workshop to
              address broad issues related to  AntarcticaOs biota and past environmental
              change in the southern  high-latitudes will be held on 21 to 23 May, 1996 in
              Wellington,  New Zealand.  The workshop will review the current state of 
              knowledge and provide a forum for scientists to develop  strategies and
              approaches for future research.  Of critical  importance to this workshop will
              be the development and  integration of biostratigraphic zonal schemes. 
              Reference  sections from the Southern Ocean and surrounding continental 
              margins of Australia, New Zealand and South America will be  compared in
              preparation for the 1996 and 1997 drilling at Cape  Roberts.  This award
              provide travel support U.S. paleontologists,  covering a range of fossil groups
              and considerable DSDP and ODP  experience, to particip ate in the workshop and
              communicate  directly with paleontologists and stratigraphers from other 
              countries involved with the Cape Roberts Project.  This effort  will enable a
              more coherent approach to the biostratigraphy and  paleontological analysis of
              Cape Roberts Project cores and  provide a forum to address larger issues
              related to the record of  life and environmental change in the southern
              high-latitudes.
