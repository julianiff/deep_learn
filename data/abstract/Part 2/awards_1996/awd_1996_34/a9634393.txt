Abstract    :
              The  research  addresses  the problem of  immobilizing  a  three-  dimensional 
              object  through a few contacts with  simple  modular  components, with
              applications in manufacturing fixture design and  robotic  grasping.   The 
              proposed  approach  is  based  on   the  kinematic notion of second-order
              immobility introduced  by  Rimon  and  Burdick.   From  a  practical point  of 
              view,  the  planned  research   is   motivated  by  its  applications  in 
              small-batch  manufacturing,  rapid prototyping, and on-demand manufacturing  . 
              The scientific objectives are (1) to develop efficient algorithms  for  
              automatically   enumerating  all  of  the   fixture/gripper  configurations 
              and  the  corresponding workpiece  positions  and  orientations for which a
              truely three-dimensional workpiece  will  be  completely  immobilized; (2) to 
              develop  grasp  and  fixture  planning  strategies capable of handling
              positioning  uncertainty  during  grasping  and fixture loading operations; 
              and  (3)  more  generally,  to develop general analytical tools for  holding 
              and  manipulating complex three-dimensional shapes with devices having  a 
              mixture  of  discrete and continuous degrees of freedom.   The  process 
              achieved in this project will be assessed by  conducting  experiments  with
              actual fixtures and the prototype  of  a  novel  automatically reconfigurable
              gripper.
