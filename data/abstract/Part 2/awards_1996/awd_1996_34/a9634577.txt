Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Proposal Number: CTS 9634577  PI: Dudukovic       This is a grant
              for partial support of the Engineering Foundation Conference on Computational
              Fluid Dynamics in Chemical Reaction Engineering to be held in San Diego, CA on
              October 13-18. It is anticipated that the conference will be significant
              examination of the role of CFD chemical reaction engineering.  The focus  of
              the conference is on:      Frontier orientation      State of the art with
              emphasis on future trends       Interface between academic discoveries and
              industrial       practice
