Abstract    :
              9634826    Carroll       Plastics fibers are widely used for reinforcing
              concretes.  Fiber-reinforced concrete is more valuable than plain concrete
              since it is more durable and less susceptible to cracking.  However, the
              processing of the fiber-reinforced converting recycled plastics into fibers for
              low cost processing of reinforcing concrete.  Currently this process is not
              well understood in determining the optimize process parameters.  This research
              project will develop mathematical models for the process and demonstrate the
              parameters effects on the properties of the fibers produced experimentally. 
              The experiments will be conducted using a laboratory scale machine to process
              the recycled fibers.         This project has a balance between theory and
              experiment.  The outcome of the research project has  potential to make the low
              cost processing of fiber reinforced concrete feasible.
