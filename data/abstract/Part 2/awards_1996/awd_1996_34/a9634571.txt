Abstract    :
              DMS 9634571 ARON    This proposal asks for participant support costs for
              graduate students and younger researchers to attend a conference titled "State
              of Banach Space Theory on the eve of the Twenty-First Century".  This
              conference will bring together researchers in the area of Banach space theory
              from all over the world.  This field is funded by NSF and most of the main
              speakers from the USA are NSF grantees, and there are several international
              stars.  Several departments at Kent State University are contributing financial
              support.
