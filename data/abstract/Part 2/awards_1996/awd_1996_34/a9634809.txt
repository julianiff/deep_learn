Abstract    :
              This research project deals with two basic issues associated  with the
              drive-by-wire nonlinear control of internal combustion  engines; the nonlinear
              modeling of the engines for feedback  controller design; and the roust
              nonlinear control of engine  torque. The nonlinear modeling incorporates the
              structure of  the engine as an odd polynomial with coefficients that are 
              transfer functions. These transfers functions are identified  using frequency
              rich inputs. The nonlinear nature of engine is  absorbed in the quadratic,
              cubic, and higher-order terms, and  hence the identification task of transfer
              functions is reduced  to a linear system identification. The development of
              nonlinear  feedback controller design is carried out in the frequency  domain
              using an inverse deseriking function approach. Hard time-  domain constraints
              representing quantitative output performance  and actuator saturation are
              directly incorporated in the design  methodology. The performance
              specifications appear as  nonsymmetrical tolerances which leads to a
              constrained system  design. Experimental verification of these technologies is 
              performed on a Ford 4.6 L V-8 engine available in Herrick  Laboratories.
