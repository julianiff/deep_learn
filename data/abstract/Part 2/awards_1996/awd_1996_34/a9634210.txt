Abstract    :
              ECS-9634210  Lee, Hua    The purpose of this equipment award is to replace the
              computation component of the laboratory with three advanced HP workstations
              (HP9000 model C110 and model  C100) in order to provide adequate computational
              support to the research programs.  In addition an Agfa ProColor Premier digital
              film recorder as an additional unit for the component of high-resolution image
              display and visualization, for the purpose of hard-copy documentation will be
              purchased.    Hewlett-Packard has offered special discounts of 50% which are
              significantly larger than the normal educational discount as a cost-sharing
              contribution.  The total cost of the equipment replacement is   $59, 832.   The
              College of Engineering will provide $20,000 as the institutional match to this
              request.  Thus, the total NSF funding is $39,832.
