Abstract    :
              The project is for a continuation of research focused on the  theoretical
              understanding of current sheets and the particle  signatures resulting from
              kinetic processes in the magnetotail.   The project will extend these
              investigations to the examination of  more realistic configurations by using
              less idealized particle and  field models as well as the examination of the two
              dimensional and  time dependence aspects of these models and of neutral line 
              signatures.  The particular focus of effort will be to examine four  areas in
              which particle kinetics may have a profound role as either  a driver or
              diagnostic of magnetospheric behavior.
