Abstract    :
              9634536  Hennage    The "Nonlinear Guided Wave Phenomena" meeting will take
              place in Cambridge,  England, August 30 - September 1, 1996. This is a Topical
              Meeting in the  OSA series which alternates between the UK and the USA, being
              held every 18  months. The subject matter includes:    * Solitons (spatial and
              temporal) and their applications to signal  processing, communications etc.   
              * Fiber and waveguide lasers    * Applications of second order effects (OPOs,
              doubler, etc.) in integrated  optics and fiber waveguides    * Nonlinear optics
              in semiconductor lasers and amplifiers and their applications    * Third order
              effects, cascading, switching devices etc.    * Materials for the above
              applications    Funds from NSF will be used to partially support costs of
              travel,  accommodations, and registration fees of young American scientists and
               graduate students in cases where their attendance at the meeting would not 
              otherwise be possible.  ***
