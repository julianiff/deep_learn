Abstract    :
                    9634657  Beltz  This award is made in order to fund research that models
              material  behavior on various length scales from the atomistic to the 
              macroscopic levels.  In particular cleavage in the presence of  plastic flow,
              in circumstances which do not involve strong  viscoplastic retardation of
              dislocation motion, will be studied.   An outstanding issue will be the role of
              nanoscale blunting of a  sharp crack when propagating through dislocation-free
              zones. It  is expected that methods for reducing brittle failure of  structural
              metallic alloys will emerge from this research.  ***
