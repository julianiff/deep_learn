Abstract    :
              9634496  Needham    The American Society for Microbiology will undertake a
              planning effort to further develop the key themes and scientific elements of a
              television-based project to inform the general public about current research
              and theories in microbiology.   The specific planning activities will include: 
                o Clarifying the vision of how the science will be made accessible and
              interesting for the general public  o Expanding the composition and role of the
              scientific advisory panel  o Reviewing and modifying the scientific content of
              the project  o Improving the coherence and clarity of the scientific themes in
              the television series    A principal means of achieving these goals will be to
              convene review meeting in conjunction with a colloquium held by the American
              Academy of Microbiology which many of the leading scientists in the field will
              attend.
