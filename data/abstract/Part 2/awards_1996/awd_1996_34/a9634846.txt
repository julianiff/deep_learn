Abstract    :
              Dempsey  9634846  The proposed articulates a research program to characterize 
              the fundamentals of plastic rheology and the brittle-to-  ductile transition
              temperature in fresh-water ice single  crystals and bi-and tri-crystals.  The
              proposed work is  exciting and interesting, and the proposed collaborations 
              are a positive aspect of the proposal.  Other strengths are  the battery of 
              experimental approaches to be applied to the  problem and the battery of
              experimental approaches to be  applied to the problem and attempt to correlate
              dislocation  structures and density with their impact on birefringence.  The
              research aim of understanding the constitutive behavior  of large
              polycrystalline ice bodies and their mechanical  interaction with engineering
              structures by understanding  fundamental rheology at the single-crystal level
              appears  justified.  ***
