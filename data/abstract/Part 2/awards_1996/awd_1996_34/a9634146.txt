Abstract    :
              9634146  Morse       Plant models are inherently inaccurate, and controllers 
              regulating processes described by such models must be able to  ensure
              satisfactory closed-loop performance in the presence of  exogenous process
              disturbances which cannot be measured.  Modern  linear control theories are now
              very highly developed and can be  used to design controllers with such
              capabilities for processes  admitting linear models provided the model
              uncertainties are  time-invariant and sufficiently small.  But for large model 
              uncertainties derived from real-time changes in plant dynamics,  simple
              examples show that no single, fixed-parameter linear  controller can possible
              regulate in a satisfactory way.  Such  large uncertainties might arise in real
              time, because of changes  in operating environment, component aging or failure,
              perhaps a  sudden change in plant dynamics due to an external influence.  To 
              cope with these types of uncertainties obviously requires a  controller which
              can change or be changed in response to received  changes in plant dynamics. 
              An especially promising system  architecture with this capability consists of a
              family or fixed-  gain or variable-gain candidate controllers, and an
              "event-driven  switching logic" called a supervisor whose job is to determine
              in  real time which controller should be applied to the process.   Examples of
              supervisory control systems include reconfigurable  systems, fault correction
              systems, and certain types of  parameter-adaptive systems.  We propose first to
              refine and  extend the concept of supervisory control introduced in our 
              earlier work, to encompass broader classes of systems and second  to use
              supervisory control as a motivating vehicle for the study  of basic issues in
              the newly emerging field of hybrid dynamical  systems.  ***
