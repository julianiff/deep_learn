Abstract    :
              9634744  Modest  The    proposed    research   involves   a    comprehensive, 
              multidisciplinary   and  well  balanced   experimental   and  theoretical 
              study to evaluate thermal stresses in  ceramics  during  laser machining.  The
              nature and the development  of  thermal  stress fields during laser drilling
              and cutting  of  ceramics  with a variety of laser sources will  be  studied. 
              Also,  the  cause  of and location of resulting  micro-  and  macro-cracks  as 
              well  as ways to minimize  thermal  stress  damage  will  be  investigated. 
              The  investigators  have  a  combination  of experience in nondestructive
              testing,  laser  machining  and  heat  transfer which is ideally  suited  for 
              conducting this research effort.  The experiments are unique  and   should 
              provide  fundamental  understanding   of   the  machining process for ceramics,
              which is very important  for  the successful manufacturing of ceramic
              components.  ***
