Abstract    :
              This grant funds the operation of the CEDAR Science Steering Committee.  The
              Committee provides coordination and information transfer for the US aeronomy
              community, as well as in the international realm.  During the next two years,
              the CSSC will meet regularly involving issues such as campaign organization,
              instrument operation, the program for the annual CEDAR summer workshop,
              promotion of CEDAR in national and international spheres, facility operation
              and science symposia planning.***
