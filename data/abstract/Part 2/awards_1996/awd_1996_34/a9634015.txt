Abstract    :
              9634015   Barsoum    In the proposed project, the superconducting
              characteristics  of the ternary compounds known as O312sO and OH-phasesO will 
              be studied.  The materials have the formula M13M2C2, where  M1 is from groups
              IIIa, IVa, Va, or VIa, and M2 is from  groups IIIb, IVb, or Vb.  A typical
              composition is Ti3SiC2.  The PIOs group has fabricated dense, single phase
              samples  and studied their atomic structure and properties.  These  ternary
              compounds share three properties with high Tc  cuprate superconductors.  Their
              atomic structure is layered,  their conductivity at room temperature is very
              high, and  their resistivity decreases with decreasing temperature.  Because of
              these similarities, there is a possibility that  these materials might also be
              superconducting.  Samples of a  variety of 312Os and H-phases will be
              characterized at  temperatures ranging from 4.2 to 300K by four-probe dc 
              resistivity, Hall effect, ac-susceptibility, magnetization  and field-induced
              microwave absorption.  %%%  The proposed SGER project will study the
              superconducting  characteristics of a group of unusual compounds, which 
              potentially might be a new class of high Tc superconductors.  ***
