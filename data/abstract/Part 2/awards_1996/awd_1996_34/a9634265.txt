Abstract    :
                  9634265  Anand  This study focuses on the development of accurate 
              constitutive equations for the interface between forming  tools and surface
              textured aluminum alloys of the  compositions being considered for use in auto
              body  applications.  Experimental measurements of the slip  resistance of
              lubricated textured surfaces will be used to  validate new state-variable
              interface constitutive  equations.  A computational procedure will then be
              developed  which uses these equations in a thermomechanical finite  element
              analysis.  The modeling will subsequently be used to  suggest optimal surface
              texturing for enhanced formability.  The study will be done in close
              cooperation with Alcoa.  ***
