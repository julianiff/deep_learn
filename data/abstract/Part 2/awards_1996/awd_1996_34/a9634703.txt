Abstract    :
                  9634703  Sharpe  This research is to support an effort that provides a solid
               foundation for the design of microelectromechanical systems  (MEMS) by
              providing mechanical properties for very small  specimens.  This type data can
              be used to help optimize the  designs of the small devices.  Prior NSF
              supported efforts have  led to an experimental technique for performing tests
              on silicon  speaimens having a thickness between 3 and 300 micrometers.  The 
              efforts in this new program will be to determine Poison's ration  for, and in
              conducting detailed and comprehensive microstructural  studies of, thin
              specimens of the MEMS materials.  Recent MEMS  applications have involved
              slightly thicker specimens of  materials other than silicon.  Such specimens
              will also be  investigated.  ***
