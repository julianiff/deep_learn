              Special Project:  6th Annual MU-SPIN Conference (1996) and Supplemental Support
              for on-campus Regional Training Workshop    This interagency transfer purpose
              is to partially support a large conference and supplemental smaller workshops
              on high performance computing and communications and infrastructure development
              for minority institutions.  NASA, through its National Space Science Data
              Center, has developed a program called the Minority University Space
              Interdisciplinary Network (MU-Spin).  The program constitutes a major
              networking and education initiative for minority institutions, and other
              universities with large minority student enrollments.  Connecting these
              institutions with the NASA Science Network, and promoting the activities such
              connections provide serve as primary goal of the program.  ***
