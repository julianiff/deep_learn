Abstract    :
                This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, 
              focusses on characterizing semiconductor/liquid interfaces created at silicon 
              surfaces by covalently attaching moieties directly to silicon without an 
              intervening oxide bridge.  Professor Nathan S. Lewis and his students of the 
              Department of Chemistry at the California Institute of Technology will employ 
              voltammetric, microwave conductivity, and differential capacitance methods to 
              characterize the electron transfer and photochemical properties of these 
              interfaces that are not complicated by the presence of an oxide bridge.  This 
              project aims to understand the fundamentals of how electron transfer can be 
              controlled at these modified silicon semiconductor/liquid interfaces.  Silicon
              is the fundamental building block for constructing semiconductor  devices. 
              Despite its common use for such applications its  electron transfer  properties
              remain poorly understood.  This research group, led by Professor  Nathan S.
              Lewis at the California Institute of Technology, is making seminal 
              contributions to the understanding of the properties of semiconductor/liquid 
              interfaces such as the dependence of electron transfer rate on distance.  This 
              project uses unique chemistry to assess such properties of the 
              semiconductor/liquid interface.  The utility of this project lies in its 
              potential for many practical applications in solar energy conversion.
