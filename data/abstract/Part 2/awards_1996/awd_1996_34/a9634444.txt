Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:  9634444  PI:  Foss     This is a grant to provide
              funding to offset the costs of travel to attend a panel discussion of
              Automotive Research Issues in Fluid Mechanics at the Second ICASE/NASA Langley
              Research Center Industry Roundtable at Williamsburg, Virginia.  This activity
              is a natural extension of the NSF/Big 3 Workshop on Fluid Flows/Fundamental
              Research Issues that took place at Michigan State University in August, 1995. 
              It is hoped that this activity will further identify significant fundamental
              fluid mechanics research issues and foster a greater degree of collaboration
              between industry, government and academe in the area of automotive research.
