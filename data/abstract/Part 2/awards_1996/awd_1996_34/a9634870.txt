Abstract    :
              9634870  Soboyejo  The  proposed  research  will integrate  micromechanics  and 
              materials   science  concepts  to  develop   synergistically  toughened  NiAl 
              composites that consist of  coated  alumina  bridging fibers and partially
              stabilized zirconia particles.  The  concept of synergistic toughening of NiAl 
              is  a  novel  method   of   utilizing  what  is  known  about  martensitic 
              transformation and fiber reinforced composites to design new  advanced material
              with optimal toughness.  The proposed work  is  multidisciplinary  and 
              collaboration  with  NASA  Lewis  strengthens  the proposal and facilitates the
              production  of  the  proposed synergistically toughened NiAl materials.  The 
              proposed  work  is  high  risk but  if  successful  it  will  generate 
              fundamental understanding of the  synergy  between  transformation   and  
              bridging  as   operative   toughening  mechanisms in composites.  ***
