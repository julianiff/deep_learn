Abstract    :
              9634211  Dunn    This Dissertation Improvement research deals with the
              privileged status of the scientific observer, which for the most part goes
              unrecognized when the researcher is preoccupied with using aggregate data.  The
              uniqueness of the project is to study one small world-system at the moment of
              it's incorporation into an expanding larger one through the eyes of explorers. 
              The small world-system of the ancient Hawaiian archipelago before that system
              was transformed and incorporated in to the modern world-system in the early
              nineteenth century will be examined.   This will be accomplished through
              studying the relative validity of different kinds of  data and using  these
              data to make inferences about structural positions of  different polities
              within the Hawaiian world-system.   The general hypothesis being tested  is
              that what is "known" about the social complexity of Hawaii at the turn of 19th
              century did not arise from observation of facts alone, but the perceptions of
              the explorers were shaped by social and historical circumstances.  The data for
              this research is mainly from accounts of Russian voyagers.  Through examining
              particular individuals' representations of events several theses of the
              world-system approach, e.g. concerning the interplay between more and less
              hierarchical neighbors will be tested.  The study seemingly suggests a need to
              move away from broad studies of total exchange distribution to more sensitive
              studies of contextual based knowledge about the exchange acts.  ***
