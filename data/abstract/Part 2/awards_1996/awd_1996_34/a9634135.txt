Abstract    :
              9634135  Gosz  This project will support the Network Office for the Long-term
              Ecological Research Network to continue critical activities including
              communication, data management, data dissemination, and technological advances.
              The Network Office will form a consortium with the San Diego Supercomputer
              Center, the Santa Fe Institute, the Center for Microbial Ecology at Michigan
              State University, and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and
              Synthesis. The facilities and interactions with these institutions and centers
              will enhance the research and creative activities of the Long-term Ecological
              Research sites. The principal goals of the Network Office are to (1) facilitate
              communication among the LTER sites to encourage integration of data sets and
              data analyses, (2) enhance the interaction of the LTER Network with a broad
              group of disciplines outside of ecology, (3) promote and disseminate new
              technologies relevant to long-term ecological research, and (4) provide
              leadership in data management and data dissemination to the LTER community and
              other scientific communities.    Long-term data are fundamental to
              understanding environmental systems and the management of our natural
              resources. The Long-term Ecological Research program provides a unique ability
              to generate this important information and the current LTER sites have provided
              many important contributions. The LTER Network Offices plays the very important
              role of catalyzing intersite activities that allow the individual sites to
              function as an integrated network. This network approach allows new knowledge
              to be generated from the individual sites in the form of comparative research,
              synthesis and expansion to regional scales. The collaboration of the LTER
              network with other international networks provides unprecedented opportunities
              to share information with international colleagues, develop exchanges of
              scientists and students. And develop a global understanding of our ecological
              systems.
