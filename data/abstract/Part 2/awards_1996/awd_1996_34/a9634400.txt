Abstract    :
              P.I.:John T. Hackett   IBN-9634400    Neurons (nerve cells)  in our brains
              communicate between each other at contact points (synapses) which excite the
              following neurons  by means of chemicals known as transmitters. When things go
              right, this process of signaling continues repeatedly in an organized way that
              results in integration of information coming into and leaving the brain. This
              process also is the basis of memory and learning.    The proposed research has
              as its long range goal to clarify the process by which neurotransmitter
              substances are released from neurons. At an early stage, the neurotransmitter
              are packaged in a stored form from which they must be mobilized to dock at the
              membrane of the release site. To help explain the mobilization process,
              mathematical calculations will test various possible outcomes that will be
              compared with experimentally obtain results.  Of particular interest is the
              finding that following repetitive stimulation more and more neurotransmitter
              substance is release by a process known as facilitation. Understanding how
              facilitation comes about will be key to our understanding of more  complicated
              forms of memory and learning.
