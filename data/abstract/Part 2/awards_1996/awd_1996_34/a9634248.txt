Abstract    :
                Abstract  Law  9634248      The proposed program represents a continuation of
              the PI?s present NSF supported research.  The major focuses of the proposed
              effort are: (1) The study of the oxidation mechanisms and flame structure of
              C2-chlorinated hydrocarbons and their mixtures with non-chlorinated
              hydrocarbons.   Laminar flame speed determinations will be made on the premixed
              flames, and extinction stretch rates measured for the nonpremixed flames.  The
              effects of C/H/Cl ratio, fuel structure, flame temperature, and inhibition due
              to chlorination will be assessed along with the development of a comprehensive
              chemical reaction mechanism;  (2) The study of soot formation in chlorinated
              hydrocarbon diffusion flames.  This will include the quantification of the
              structure of non-sooting and near sooting flames, the determination of the soot
              inception and extinction strain-rate limits, the mapping of the soot profile in
              order to assess the effects of chlorination on soot nucleation, growth and
              oxidation, and the development of detailed kinetic models of soot formation in
              C/H/O/Cl systems.  This latter task represents a new area of research for the
              PI.
