Abstract    :
              9634801  Capo    This grant provides $275,000 as partial support of the costs of
               acquiring a thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) equipped  with
              multiple Faraday collectors, ion counting and negative ion  capabilities and
              peripheral devices for use as the analytical  centerpiece of the radiogenic
              isotope geochemistry program to be  started at the University of Pittsburgh. 
              The PI's, Capo and  Stewart were recently hired by Pittsburgh and this award
              includes  significant cost sharing from the University both for the  instrument
              acquisition itself and in the form of laboratory  startup costs. Acquisition of
              a new TIMS at Pittsburgh will  provide the analytical capabilities necessary to
              conduct a range  of interesting and recently funded Quaternary pedogenic and 
              biogeochemical process studies.  Specific studies will include  the use of Sr
              isotopes to determine the relative contribution of  atmospheric and silicate
              weathering sources of Ca2+ in volcanic  and desert soils, further refinement of
              the Sr isotope  stratigraphy of Cenozoic marine carbonates and the use of Rb/Sr
               and Sm/Nd isotope systematics as tracers of igneous petrogenesis  and
              ore-bearing fluid migration.  ***
