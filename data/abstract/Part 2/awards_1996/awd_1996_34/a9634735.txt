Abstract    :
              9634735  Kovadevic       Automatic gas tungsten arc welding is widely used for
              precision joining.  Although automatic welding machines can realize the
              pre-programmed welding parameters more accurately than a human operator, they
              lack the visual feedback capability associated with the human operator to
              compensate for the deviations in the process.  This project is aimed to provide
              an innovative weld penetration control technology by developing a neurofuzzy
              model-based nonlinear adaptive control system with vision feedback of the weld
              pool.  In the proposed control system, the welding current, torch speed, and
              arc length are used as the control variables to achieve the desired size and
              shape of the weld pool.  Also investigated in the project are the dynamic
              behavior of the weld pool and the correlation between the pool geometrical
              appearance and penetration.        Weld penetration control is central to
              automatic welding.  The development of an advanced weld penetration control
              technology is essential to resolving the present bottle-neck problem in precise
              joining. The investigation of the dynamic behavior of the weld pool provides
              fundamental knowledge valuable to welding physics.  Industrial relevancy of the
              research is enhanced by the existing strong collaboration with industrial
              firms.  ***
