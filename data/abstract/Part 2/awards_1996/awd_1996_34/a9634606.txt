Abstract    :
              9634606  Scanlan  Description:  This award is for the continuation of a
              U.S.-India  research collaboration in wind engineering between Robert Scanlan 
              of Johns Hopkins University and Prem Krishna of the University of  Roorkee. 
              Experiments will be conducted at the Corrsin laminar  flow wind tunnel at
              Hopkins and at the new boundary layer tunnel  at Roorkee.  The investigators
              will study the specific use and  interpretation of bridge deck section models
              and building models in  the respective wind tunnels.  Theory developed at
              Hopkins on the  use of flutter derivatives in determining wind stability will
              be used  relative to section models at Roorkee and Hopkins.  The research  will
              investigate the detailed geometric forms needed to enhance  stability in deck
              models.    Scope:  This award will allow travel between the research sites to 
              complete the agreed upon level of effort.  The funds requested for  the entire
              research project are modest at about $30,000.  This  project will continue
              development of the flutter derivatives concept,  considered a major advance in
              wind engineering, and extend abroad  the influence of U.S. technology in
              aerodynamic design.  For India,  the project will contribute to developing
              modelling expertise,  technical education, and improvements in design and
              construction  methods.    ***
