Abstract    :
                      OSCAR is a computer-based architecture for an artificial rational agent,
              based upon a general-purpose automated reasoner.  The objective of this project
              is to develop a decision-theoretic planning system within the OSCAR
              architecture.  Existing automated planning systems tend to make unrealistic
              assumptions about the planning environment, the most serious being (1) that the
              planner has a fixed knowledge base that does not change over time, and (2) that
              it is known with certainty what the result will be of taking any relevant
              action in any describable situation.  This project is aimed at relaxing these
              assumptions by making use of innovative features of the OSCAR architecture. 
              The automated reasoner upon which OSCAR is based is capable of more
              sophisticated reasoning than has been available in the past to automated
              planners.  This will culminate in an automated planning system capable of
              operating in richer environments than has been possible in the past, and will
              be useful for diverse tasks ranging from automating manufacturing to launching
              a space shuttle.
