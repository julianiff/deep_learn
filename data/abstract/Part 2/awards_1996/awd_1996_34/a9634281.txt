Abstract    :
              9634281    Swift    In this project, the principal investigators will operate 
              the  International Data Assembly Center (DAC) for hydrographic  data  collected
              by the World Ocean Circulation Experiment.  The  functions  of the DAC are to: 
                1.  Acquire WOCE Hydrographic Program  (WHP)  data and related documentation
              in any readable, unambiguous  format;  2.  Carry out data quality control
              procedures on the data,  and  provide usable data to authorized users as
              quickly as  possible;  3.  Provide access to data held by the DAC to authorized
              users,  and to  provide publicly av/ailable data sets to the Special  Analysis 
              Center with minimum delay;  4.  Produce final WHP Data  Reports for  each WHP
              expedition;   5.  Facilitate the exchange of data  among  both producers and
              users;   6. Maintain a complete record of  the  status of the WHP measure-ment
              programs; and,  7. Report to  the  WOCE and funding agency oversight structures
              as recommended.
