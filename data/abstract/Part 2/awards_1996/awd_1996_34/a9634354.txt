Abstract    :
              9634354  Moore  A Conference/Workshop on the "Dynamics of a Disaster:  Hurricane
              Impact, Recovery and Mitigation in the United  States Virgin Islands", will be
              held in late Fall 1996, St.  Thomas, U. S. Virgin Islands.  The objective of
              this  conference is to bring together experts in wing engineering, 
              meteorology, public policy and economics with leading  representatives from
              government, insurance, banking and  human services to discuss the impact from
              Hurricane Marilyn  on the Virgin Islands, the recovery process and the 
              effectiveness of mitigation measures taken after Hurricane  Hugo in September
              1989.  Areas of future research will be  identified based on these experiences
              and the  recommendations will be disseminated to the research  community.  ***
