Abstract    :
              9634337  McNider   It is the purpose of this project to develop tools and
              linkages between climate models and the hydrology of  the Tennessee River.  
              Specifically, we will examine the relationships and techniques for assessing
              the thermal quality of  the waters of  the reservoirs and stream sections of
              the Tennessee River System.  Previous studies have shown that the thermal
              quality of water is critical to maintenance of the ecology of the river system
              and is a regulatory constraint for industries along the river.  This also a
              river attribute which may be sensitive to changes in hydrological
              characteristics such as precipitation evapotranspiration as well as changes in
              temperature.  Thus, it is of concern in climate change scenarios.  In order to
              build and test thermal quality assessment models we will emphasize modeling the
              1988-1989 period which represents the biggest hydrological contrast in the
              present climate record for this region.  The project will utilize mesoscale
              atmospheric models to develop higher resolution inputs to the hydrologic
              models, physically based hydrologic models to characterize streamflows and a
              reservoir analysis model to translate physical information into economic and
              environmental quality measures.  The objective of the study is to determine
              whether a global scale model can capture the important interannual signals
              affecting regional hydrology and whether this information can be propagated
              with fidelity through a mesoscale model through a hydrology model to a thermal
              quality model to replicate actual impacts.
