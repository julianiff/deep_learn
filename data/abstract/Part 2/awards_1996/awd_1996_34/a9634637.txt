Abstract    :
              9634637  Cowen         This project is a rapid response to a
              hydrothermal/volcanic  event on the Gorda Ridge in the northeast Pacific.  On
              Feb. 1996 a  major seismic event was detected by the NOAA VENTS program through
               monitoring of the US Navy SOSUS hydrophone arrays.  NOAA dispatched  the
              research vessel MacArthur and they discovered a hydrothermal  megaplume in the
              area of the seismic activity.  The availability of  the research vessel Wecoma
              in early April allows a more detailed  response.  The objectives of this cruise
              are to locate the source  of the magaplume, to determine whether there has been
              a subsurface  bacterial bloom, to determine geochemical and microbial 
              concentrations in the plume, and if possible, to establish patterns  of crustal
              breakage and/or eruption.
