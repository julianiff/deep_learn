Abstract    :
              9634034  Jaslow    Maricopa County Community College District will initiate a
              60-month Local Systemic Change project for 187 teachers in grades 9-12 in 5
              Arizona school districts and schools in the UCAN RSI.  The project's
              partners,the unified districts of Chandler, Sunnyside, Nogales, Mingus and
              Sedona-Oak Creek, Maricopa County Community College, Arizona State University
              and the Intel Corporation, will implement the Interactive Mathematics Program
              (IMP) in those districts through the use of seven integrated components:  1) 
              inservice on the mathematics and pedagogy of IMP, 2)  follow-up support
              activities, 3)  internal capacity for professional development, 4)  school
              teams for support of teachers, 5)  teachers from schools considering IMP, 6) 
              articulation with feeder schools, and 7)  impact on preservice teacher
              training.  In addition to the high school teachers, support teams consisting of
              school administrators, counselors and other teachers, teams of middle school
              teachers that feed into the participating high schools, teams from schools
              considering the implementation of new curriculum materials, and personnel from
              each of the three state universities will take part in the professional
              development activities.  Additional school districts will join the project in
              years three and four.    There is cost sharing equivalent to 244% of the NSF
              funding.
