Abstract    :
              9634873  Rikvold  This research involves the study of the statics and dynamics 
              of several lattice-gas models with applications in materials  physics and
              chemistry using non-perturbative numerical  techniques and analytical methods
              of statistical mechanics.  The project consists of two parts: (1) a study of 
              equilibrium and nonequilibrium aspects of ordering and  fluctuations in
              electrochemical adsorption, and, (2) a  fundamental study of metastable phases
              of matter and their  modes of decay.  Both parts of the research cross 
              traditional boundaries of physics, chemistry and materials  science and will
              require the use and development of novel  computational algorithms.  %%%  This
              theoretical research is comprised of two parts.  One  part will apply various
              models to study the adsorption of  molecules to the surface of materials due to
               electrochemistry.  This electrochemical adsorption is  fundamental to a number
              of processes including  electrodeposition of metals (electroplating), corrosion
              and  batteries.  While there has recently been an upsurge in the  available
              experimental data, there has been a dearth of  modeling to interpret this data.
               The second part of the  research will study fundamental issues of phases of 
              materials which are neither stable nor unstable.  These  unusual metastable
              states of matter are of high interest in  helping to understand the transition
              between stable and  unstable states.  They are also of interest in their own 
              right and apply to such systems as superheated steam.  ***
