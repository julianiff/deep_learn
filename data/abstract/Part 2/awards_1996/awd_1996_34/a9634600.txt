Abstract    :
              9634600  El-Sharkawi    The circuit breaker is one of the most critical elements
              in a  power system. The safety of the public and utility personnel, and  the
              reliability of the system operation depends on the breaker's  performance. 
              Circuit breakers are therefore subjected to  rigorous maintenance. 
              Unfortunately, a large expense is incurred  that could otherwise be avoided if
              a reliable and economic method  for on-load evaluation of breaker contacts
              conditions was  available. A project to do so is described in this proposal. 
              Our  expectations of success are predicted on the excellent results in  another
              project-collaboration between the University of  Washington, SCE, the NSF and
              EPRI: The Shorted-Turn Detector in  Turbo-Generator Rotor Windings.    In
              addition, this project will provide an unique opportunity for  an important
              exchange of technical information and expertise  between the electric utility
              industry and academia.  ***
