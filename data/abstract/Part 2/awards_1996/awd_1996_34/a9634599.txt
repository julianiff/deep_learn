Abstract    :
                This proposal will further develop a hybrid fluid/kinetic model and  use the
              model to investigate the polar wind.  In this model,  thermal electron features
              of the polar wind are described by fluid  calculations while the suprathermal
              electron features, as well as  H+ and O+ ions are described using a kinetic
              model in a global  environment.  Columbo collisions among species are taken
              into  account and the ambipolar electric field is computed self  consistently. 
              This approach is the first to be able to incorporate  the global collisional
              physics of photoelectrons into a self-  consistent description.  Global
              steady-state polar wind solutions  that vary continuously from a subsonic
              collisional regime to a  supersonic collisionless regime have been generated in
              exploratory  calculations.  The investigation here will be first devoted to 
              parametric studies in order to better understand the complex inter-  relations
              between various ionospheric boundary conditions and their  effects on polar
              wind outflow.  Results of the model investigations  will be compared with
              results being obtained from polar wind data  obtained from experiments on the
              DE and Akebono satellites.
