Abstract    :
              9634048  Briars      The Pittsburgh Reform in Mathematics (PRIME) project is
              part of a broad systemic initiative in Pittsburgh designed to implement
              standards-based instruction in all content areas.  In this four-year project,
              PRIME will support teachers in the classroom implementation of standards-based
              mathematics instruction and assessment in grades K-12 through the use of
              exemplary instructional materials (e.g., Everyday Mathematics in grades K-3,
              Connected Mathematics in grades 6-8, and materials from other grades to be
              determined from a defined menu).   PRIME will also help teachers attain a broad
              knowledge base in both the mathematics content and successful mathematics
              pedagogy needed in order to understand and implement the new materials
              successfully.      As a Local Systemic Change through Teacher Enhancement
              project (and one of the initial  projects funded at the middle/high school
              levels under the guidelines for Local Systemic Change through Teacher
              Enhancement in Mathematics, Grades 7-12), PRIME will provide all 924 Pittsburgh
              Public Schools teachers of mathematics with a range of activities that include
              multi-day summer workshops, prime-time, release-day professional development
              workshops, and individualized, in-class support provided by demonstration
              teachers and/or mathematics lead teachers within each school.   By equipping
              all Pittsburgh mathematics teachers with the knowledge, skills, and support
              necessary for effectively using exemplary materials and assessments, PRIME will
              ensure that all students experience a coherent mathematics program that will
              yield high achievement at all levels.  All teachers of grades 6-12 receive 234
              hours of professional development, and teachers of grades K-5 receive 102-132
              hours.      Cost-sharing in the project is approximately $ 6 million, primarily
              from the Pittsburgh Public Schools.
