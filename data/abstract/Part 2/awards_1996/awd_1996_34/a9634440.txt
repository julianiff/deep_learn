Abstract    :
              Professor John Light of the University of Chicago is being supported by   the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program.  The project   involves the
              development of both new and improved mathematical and   computational methods
              for calculating and predicting quantum dynamical   processes.  The methods rely
              largely on the use of the discrete variable   representation of the potential
              as well as the development of methods   based on square integrable functions to
              molecular scattering.  The   applications include the prediction of the
              ro-vibrational spectra of   floppy molecular dimers such as the water dimer,
              several investigations   of resonances in reactive scattering and
              photodissociation as well as   applications in the area of molecule surface
              scattering.   The accurate determination of structure and dynamics of few atoms
              systems   is of great importance to understanding and modeling a number of  
              important processes such as absorption and emission of light, energy   transfer
              and chemical reactions.  This work continues the development and   application
              of accurate methods in chemical physics to the study of such   phenomena. 
              Chemical reactions both in the gas phase and on surfaces are   being
              successfully described by the use of increasingly sophisticated   mathematical
              models.  Several such models are being developed in this   theoretical study,
              thus aiding our understanding and control of a number   of processes such as
              combustion, catalysis, and the formation of   molecules and materials.
