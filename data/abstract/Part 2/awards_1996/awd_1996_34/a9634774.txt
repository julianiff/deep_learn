Abstract    :
              9634774  Reed  Funds for the International travel of a team of United  States
              wind engineering experts are provided for them to  attend the 2nd European and
              African Regional Conference on  Wind Engineering.  The participants include
              both junior and  senior members of this research community, whose presence 
              will enhance the exchange of valuable information, the  possibility of building
              international partnerships and  collaborative efforts for joint research
              projects.  Also, it  presents an unique opportunity to determine the state-of 
              knowledge of all the participant countries and the  possibility of setting
              technology transfer mechanisms. ***
