Abstract    :
              9634056  Sekerka  This is a renewal grant which will focus on improving and 
              applying the phase field model to obtain a quantitative  understanding of the
              morphologies of growing crystals and in  particular those formed by
              solidification from the melt.  Knowledge of such morphologies is of practical
              importance  because it determines the microstructures of materials and, 
              consequently, their properties.  Results are also of  scientific interest
              because they shed light on the  fundamental physics of pattern formation and
              the solution of  free boundary problems which are at the frontier of applied 
              mathematics.    The research is comprised of three parts: (1) cellular  shapes
              and cellular dendritic shapes that occur during  directional solidification
              from alloy melts will be  investigated; (2) thermal fluctuations and noise will
              be  added to the phase field model in such a way as to insure  that the
              fluctuation-dissipation theory is satisfied; (3)  the phase field model will be
              generalized to include fluid  flow with solidification.  %%%  This is a renewal
