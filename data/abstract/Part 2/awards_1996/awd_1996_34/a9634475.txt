              (I)ntegration Thr(OU)gh Performance and Vi(S) ualization      This CISE
              Educational Innovation award supports the integration of research into the
              undergraduate curriculum through the themes of performance evaluation and
              measurement and visualization by developing software, assignments and
              instructional support.  Some undergraduate students will assist with
              development of the project and all students will benefit from the integration
              of both established and cutting-edge research into a traditional curriculum.   
              Over a three year period, undergraduates, graduate students and faculty from
              the Department of Computer Science will develop these materials primarily in
              the summers and integrate them into the courses during the academic year.  In
              the second year, faculty and undergraduates from Western Carolina University,
              Appalachian State University, University of North Carolina Ashville, North
              Carolina Central University and East Carolina University will join in the
              development of materials and the integration of materials into courses at their
              institutions.  All materials are being made available  on the World Wide Web.
