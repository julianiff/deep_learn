Abstract    :
              ***  9634815  Dixon  This Research Planning Grant focuses on the feasibility of 
              virtual environment. Specific planning objectives are as  follows:        
              Complete an extensive literature search of research to    date performed in the
              object-oriented computer-based area of    virtual reality and the application
              of this technology to    infrastructure modeling.         Identify and contact
              local and national experts in the    area of advanced computer and virtual
              reality applications.         Perform preliminary translation tasks to
              determine the    compatiility issues that will occur when modifying the   
              digital terrain models created by software in current use    and those required
              for application to the virtual reality    environment. Initial planning tasks
              will include    determination of the required hierarchial processes of   
              grouping and combining digital terrain model features into    polygons or
              sufaces for ultimate virtual reality    applications.***
