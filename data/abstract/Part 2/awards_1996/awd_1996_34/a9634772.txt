Abstract    :
              9634772  Collier         This project is a rapid response to a
              hydrothermal/volcanic  event on the Gorda Ridge in the northeast Pacific.  On
              28 Feb. 1996  a major seismic event was detected by the NOAA VENTS program 
              through monitoring of the US Navy SOSUS hydrophone arrays.  NOAA  dispatched
              the research vessel MacArthur and they discovered a  hydrothermal megaplume in
              the area of the seismic activity.  The  availability of the research vessel
              Wecoma in early April allows a  more detailed response.  The objectives of this
              cruise are to  locate the source of the magaplume, to determine whether there
              has  been a subsurface bacterial bloom, to determine geochemical and  microbial
              concentrations in the plume, and, if possible, to  establish patterns of
              crustal breakage and/or eruption.
