              Abstract  ATM-9634345  Norton, Stephen A.  Jacobson, George L.  University of

               Ice Cover    Several lines of paleolimnological and lake water chemistry 
              research suggest that (1) selenium (Se) in lake sediments is  linearly related
              to the percentage of organic matter for individual  lakes and (2) normalized to
              organic matter concentration for lake  districts, Se concentration is related
              to distance from the open  ocean.  The linkage is through the delivery of Se in
              marine  aerosols from the open ocean to lake basin catchments and the 
              subsequent incorporation of Se (a chemical analog for S) into  organic matter. 
              Marine aerosols are the only significant sources  of Se to most aquatic
              ecosystems.  This SGER award supports the  investigation of stratigraphic
              variations in Se concentration in  coastal lakes as a record of changing
              distance to open ocean and as  a proxy for sea-ice cover.  Methods will involve
              chemical  palynological, and radiometric analyses (the later to establish 
              absolute age) of existing cores spanning the Holocene and core  spanning the
              Little Age to the present.  This will enable  calibration of the method against
              known climate variation and  historically-documented variation in sea-ice
              cover.
