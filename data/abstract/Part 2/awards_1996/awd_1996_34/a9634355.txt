Abstract    :
              9634355  Kumara   This award provides funding for the  "First Workshop on
              Real-World Problem Solving and Decision Making in Design and Manufacturing," to
              be held at the University of Tokyo, Japan during June 1996. Academicians,
              industry researchers and practitioners from USA and Japan will interact and use
              their collective experiences to:  (1) compile, organize, and identify key
              real-world problems in design and manufacturing,  (2) list potential real-world
              cases in design and manufacturing for investigation and presentation, (3)
              formulate a framework for discussion on how real-world problem solving is
              conducted in industry and how it should be taught in universities and industry,
              and (4) design an implementation architecture for using the World Wide Web as a
              means of developing the cases and using them in a global classroom setting.  
              If successful, the results of this activity will benefit undergraduate
              education in engineering and manufacturing companies. The key issues in design
              and manufacturing identified in this workshop will pave the way for developing
              a compendium of cases and form the basis for teaching real-world engineering
              design skills to undergraduate students. The implementation architecture for
              using the World Wide Web will aim toward defining and implementing the concept
              of a global classroom. The workshop will bring together academicians and
              industry personnel from the U.S. and Japan who will collectively help to  
              compile and disseminate information and expertise on real-world engineering
              design skills required in the current environment of global manufacturing.
