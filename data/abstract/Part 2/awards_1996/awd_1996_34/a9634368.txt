Abstract    :
              IBN:  9634368  PI:  McLaughlin    This project will be supported under the NSF
              program  on INTEGRATING ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES INTO NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH; it is
              a   collaboration of mathematicians and neuroscientists attacking  the most
              important issues in brain research. In our view, the premier problem   facing
              us is how to understand the function of the cerebral cortex of the brain   as a
              functioning neural network. We study the part of the cerebral cortex that 
              handles visual information--called the visual cortex.    Cells in the visual
              cortex are selectively sensitive for the   orientations of the visual
              boundaries of objects.  We will   develop and test neural network models for
              this selectivity,   to see whether it is a property that emerges from
              interactions   between nerve cells in the cerebral cortex, or whether it is a  
              passive by-product of the connections to cortical cells from   lower levels of
              the visual system of the brain. We believe   that understanding the neural
              basis for orientation tuning in   the visual cortex may be crucial for
              understanding the   function of the entire cortex.  If we find evidence that  
              interaction between neighboring neurons in the cerebral cortex   is essential
              for orientation tuning to work, then this will be   crucial support for the
              idea that the cerebral cortex is a   richly interconnected, interactive neural
              network that can be   studied with available analytical tools.
