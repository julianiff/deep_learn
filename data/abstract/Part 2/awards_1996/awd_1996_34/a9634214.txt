Abstract    :
              The study of vocal communication in non-human primates has significant
              implications for the understanding of human speech and consciousness.  The
              discovery that monkey vocalizations frequently communicate specific information
              has provided important insights into the evolution of human language ability.
              This project investigates the function of the most frequent vocalization used
              by the Venezuelan wedge-capped capuchin monkey (Cebus olivaceus).  The meanings
              of the vocalization will be determined by recording calls made during foraging
              for food and correlating the acoustic structure of the calls with the
              behavioral context.  Analysis will focus on whether the calls inform listeners
              of the identity or status of the vocalizer, how the calls are related to the
              use of different types of food resources, and how the calls indicate social
              relationships.  In addition to providing information about a category of call,
              quiet calls, that has not been extensively studied, this project will be the
              first long-term study of the behavior and diet of the wedge-capped capuchin to
              be carried out in a habitat other than riverine forest.  As such, it will
              supply added information about the social behavior and ecology of this most
              adaptable and intelligent New World monkey.
