Abstract    :
              9634763  Buyukozturk  The  objective of this research is to provide  a 
              scientific  basis   for  the  underlying  mechanisms  of  fracture   and 
              delamination  of precracked reinforced concrete  retrofitted  using 
              fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP)  composite  laminates,  and  to develop design
              guidelines for efficient applications  and  safe  engineering designs of these
              systems.   Laminated  beams have been observed to fail through several
              mechanisms,  including  yielding  of  the  laminate,  crushing   of   the 
              concrete, and brittle fracture through delamination  of  the  composite from
              the concrete.  Available experience has shown  that fracture through
              delamination can occur at stress below  material limits and under loads within
              normal service.   The  emphasis  of  this  study will be on  delamination  and 
              its  causes,  specifically in the presence of  combined  flexural  and shear
              cracks in the retrofitted concrete beam.  Fracture  mechanics based combined
              experimental and numerical  studies  of  failure  initiating  from the
              concrete-adherent-laminate  interface  region  will  be  performed  on 
              concrete   beams  laminated   with   fiber-reinforced  plastics.    Parametric 
              investigations    involving    different    materials    and  construction  
              techniques   will   determine   the   optimum  effectiveness of these
              combinations.  The project will  have  the   collaboration  of  Swiss  Federal 
               Laboratories   for  Materials  Testing and Research (EMPA) in Switzerland 
              where  large   scale  tests  will  be  conducted  with   consistent  parameters
              as will be used in this study.  This research  is  expected   to  provide  a 
              fundamental  knowledge   of   FRP  delamination, and be developing the needed
              design guidelines  to  have a direct impact on engineering application  in  the
               retrofitting  field  in an efficient, economical,  and  safe  manner.  ***
