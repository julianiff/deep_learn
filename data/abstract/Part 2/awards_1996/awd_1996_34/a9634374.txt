Abstract    :
              9634374  Krim  Under an SGER award an attempt will be made to determine the 
              magnitude of the mechanical stimulation in tribochemical  events.  Single
              layers of reagent gas molecules will be  adsorbed on the metallic sample
              surface and the surface will  then be rubbed by the tip of an atomic force
              microscope  (AFM) in an oscillating mode, simulating a tribological  system. 
              Changes in the nature of the surface layer will be  indicated by the quartz
              crystal microbalance in which the  sample is mounted.  The nature of the
              reaction molecule can  then be determined by imaging it with the AFM.  The
              initial  systems selected for testing (ethylene/Pt and oxygen/Ag)  have been
              very well characterized as far as their thermal  reaction kinetics are
              concerned.  This should allow the  mechanical component of the tribochemical
              reaction to be  determined from the results.  ***
