Abstract    :
              9634710  Fabrycky    This award provides funding for fundamental research on
              engineering design.  An underlying premise of this work is that engineering
              design is a decision-making process.  As such, it involves decisions whose
              objective is to maximize value.  To date, however, a measure of value has not
              generally been available to engineers participating in a design, and their
              design decisions have had to be made largely in the dark.  Specifically, this
              research seeks to generate a measure of systems worth that can be displayed to
              engineers participating in a design in near real time, thus enabling them to
              make decisions that maximize or at least increase system worth.  An important
              feature of this measure is that it will include life cycle factors, including
              environmental impacts.    If successful, this research will provide both a new
              direction in engineering design research and considerably increased value to
              the engineering design process.  It is becoming increasingly the consensus that
              engineering design is a decision-making process, and a measure of system worth,
              available to engineers working on a design, is a critical element of design
              decision making.  This research holds the promise to lay a foundation that
              could greatly improve the quality of engineering design across all engineering
              products, processes and services.
