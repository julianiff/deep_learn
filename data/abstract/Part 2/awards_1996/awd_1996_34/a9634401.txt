Abstract    :
                IBN:  9634401  PI:  Hiromoto      Specific functional areas of the brain can
              contain 100,000 to 1   million neurons.  When trying to model functional
              aspects of these   neural networks it is critically important that the model is
              of a   sufficiently large scale (greater than 1,000 neurons) to examine  
              emergent properties of the network.  Large-scale biophysical neural   networks
              on the order of 10,000 neurons require efficient   computational resources that
              are beyond the normal scope of single   high-speed computer workstations. 
              Advances in interprocessor   communications and algorithms for computing
              large-scale problems now   permit us to apply these methods to
              neurophysiological questions. In   this work, we intend to develop tools that
              can be used to investigate   how networks of biophysical models of neurons
              behave based on known   anatomical connectivity, cellular neurophysiology, and
              rules for   synaptic plasticity.    Our project has two specific aims.  First,
              we will develop algorithms   and supporting software that exploit the inherent
              properties of   parallel computational architectures for simulating the
              synchronous   activity of neuron models interconnected by synapses that undergo
                activity-dependent changes in strength. Such changes may accompany  
              learning. The simulator developed here will be user-modifiable at many   levels
              allowing for the study of different brain regions having varied   anatomical
              and physiological characteristics.  Second, graphic   visualization tools will
              be developed to better study and analyze the   large amounts of data produced
              by the large-scale neural  simulations. These will include methods to examine
              the states of   individual neurons as well as the correlated activity of
              different   neurons within the network.
