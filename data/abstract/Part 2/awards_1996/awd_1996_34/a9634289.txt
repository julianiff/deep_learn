Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      OPP-9634289  DYURGEROV, MARK  UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO    The
              researchers will develop a new method for studying the annual cycle of glacial
              melting in relation to climate change. Satellite imagary will be used to
              examine large areas encompassing many glaciers rather than traditional methods
              of studying individual glaciers using time-consuming field measurements. The
              assessment of annual glacial melting rates is important because it may provide
              a precursor to climate change and the meltwater will contribute to a sealevel
              rise. That rise will have potentially serious effects on coastal human
              populations and must be examined if management policies are required to prepare
              for the rise.
