Abstract    :
              9634502  Eguiluz  This grant is to support work on calculation of collective 
              properties of metals, namely the influence of electron-  electron interaction
              using realistic band structure energies  for electrons.  The current
              understanding of these  properties is based on rather simple models such as
              Jellium  or Hubbard model.  As the full complexity of the metal  response is
              being explored in various state-of-the-art  electron spectroscopies, such a
              study is not only feasible,  it becomes imperative as well.  The project
              includes: (1)  calculation of inelastic scattering cross sections for 
              electrons and x-rays, (2) influence of charge and spin  fluctuations on the
              quasi particle states near the Fermi  surface, (3) magnetic response of
              atomically thin films and  (4) temperature dependence of the magnetic
              properties in a  3d ferromagnet.  The work involves close collaboration with 
              experimental colleagues.  %%%  This grant supports theoretical  work on complex
              and subtle  properties of metals using realistic models where the  earlier work
              has been done on specially developed simplified  models.  The work involves
              calculation of specific  quantities which can be compared to experiments.  In 
              particular, this project will considerably enhance our  understanding of
              temperature dependence of magnetism and the  magnetic properties of thin films.
