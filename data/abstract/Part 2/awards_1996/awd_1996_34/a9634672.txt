Abstract    :
              Reduction of interior sound radiation in enclosed  environments such as in
              helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and  land vehicles is a very important
              problem. There are two  mainstream techniques for dealing with this problem.
              One is  the active noise cancellation method (ANC) using  loudspeakers, and the
              other is sound radiation reduction  strategy via structural controls (often
              called active  structural acoustic control or ASAC). This research project 
              deals with the development of a mathematical theory for the  acoustic boundary
              control method and to analytically and  experimentally demonstrate the
              advantages of a new acoustic  boundary actuation method over the existing ones.
              The  specific research tasks include a study of the spatial  characteristics of
              acoustic boundary control; development of  a neural network for selecting
              optimal spatial  configurations; development of hardware prototypes of  sensing
              and actuation devices for implementing acoustic  boundary control; and
              evaluation of existing feedforward  adaptive and feedback control algorithms in
              conjunction with  the acoustic boundary control strategy. The results obtained 
              from this research project will lead to the development of  technologies for
              eliminating interior noise of the vehicles,  and the generation of important
              theoretical groundwork that  will enable technology development for reducing
              exterior  noise radiation.
