Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9634266  R.  Terry Baker        Graphitic carbon nanofibers will
              be utilized as support for mettallic NI or Pt catalysts.  The fibers will be
              synthesized with preferential orientation of graphite platelets, or modified
              electrochemically after synthesis.  The metal particles, synthesized by
              impregnation, calcination and reduction, have been shown to have unique
              activity and selectivity for the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene.  This project
              will study in detail the effect of fiber surface structure on particle
              morphology and corresponding catalytic characteristics under gas and liquid
              hydrogenation conditions.
