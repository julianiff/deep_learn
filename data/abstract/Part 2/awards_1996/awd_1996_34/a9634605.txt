Abstract    :
              INT-9634605  Thakur   Description:  This project addresses three  important
              aspects of the neotectonics of the  Himalayan foothills and adjacent plains of 
              India-the long-term slip rate on the plate  boundary fault, the recurrence
              interval for  great Himalayan-front earthquakes and the  amount of strain
              released within the Himalaya  rather than the Himalayan front.  The work 
              involves construction of balanced sections  using surface outcrops, drilling
              and seismic  reflection profiles, mapping of Quaternary  deposits, trenching
              and geomorphic analysis of  river profiles.  This research is in  collaboration
              with the Wadia Institute of  Himalayan Geology and the Oil and Natural Gas 
              Commission of India.  Results are of  fundamental interest and considerable
              utility  in the assessment of potential earthquake  hazards in the Himalayan
              foothills of northwest  India.     Scope:  The project requires dollar funding
              for  data interpretation and training of Indian  scientists in the US and
              Indian currency to  support travel to India and to supplement field  research
              costs.  Government of India Clearance  for this collaborative project allows US
               scientists to conduct field work  in sensitive  border areas of the Himalayas.
