Abstract    :
              ***  9634267  Daughton    This Small Business Innovation Research  (SBIR) Phase
              II project will demonstrate the integration of Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR)
              isolation devices with control and power electronics, which will result in a
              high performance integrated solid state relay (SSR).  Current SSR technology
              suffers from several technical drawbacks, including large relative size, slow
              switching speeds, and wear-out mechanisms due mainly to the technical
              limitations of opto-isolation technology.  Opto-isolation construction
              precludes integration with power electronics, due to integrated circuit (IC)
              process incompatibility, is relatively slow, and can wear-out through
              light-emitting diode (LED) failure.  In addition to demonstrating a fully
              integrated device, Phase II will concentrate on power electronics research with
              the objective of reducing the relative size of the device for a given power
              level.  Phase II will continue the successful hybrid demonstrations of Phase 1.
               The emphasis of Phase II will be on low voltage solid state relays having
              blocking voltages of less than 60 volts and on-current capacities of  1 ampere
              or less.   In addition, various contact resistance devices under 1 ohm will be
              pursued.    Commercial applications are expected in SSR, opto-isolator, and
              reed switch replacements for the computer, telecommunications, consumer
              electronics, and automotive industries.The complete integration of
              GMR-isolation, control, and optimized power electronics will allow the design
              of GMR-isolated SSRs which would be smaller, faster, and more reliable than
              existing opto-isolated SSRs, thus allowing SSRs to function in applications
              presently not suitable.    ***
