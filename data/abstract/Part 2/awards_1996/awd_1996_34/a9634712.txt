Abstract    :
              9634712  Bean   This research involves the development of theory and algorithms
              to solve nonhomogeneous Markov decision problems.  The application area to be
              considered results from just-in-time production and distribution practices. 
              Massive data requirements and extremely long computation times make solving
              nonhomogeneous Markov a formidable task.  This research will develop theory
              that isolates the data important to making good decisions from the large volume
              of data that have no direct effect.  The primary approach will integrate
              forecast horizons, parametric Markov decision processes and genetic algorithms.
               This theory will be embedded in algorithms that will be implemented and
              evaluated against data from production and transportation problems.    The
              relatively high-risk research objectives of (1) developing theory for solving
              nonhomogeneous Markov through treatment as parametric Markov decision processes
              and acceleration of parametric Markov decision processes algorithms using
              sampling information and (2) developing implementable algorithms to solve
              nonhomogeneous Markov using forecast horizon theory to reduce problem size,
              genetic algorithms to eliminate the bulk of the computation, and then the
              results of the genetic algorithms to accelerate parametric Markov decision
              processes algorithms to obtain a provably optimal solution have an excellent
              chance of being met.  The result will be a unique hybrid of artificial
              intelligence-based algorithms that result in fast computation times and
              provable optimality.
