Abstract    :
              9634179  Mukherjee, A.  The proposed research will study superplastic flow on 
              different microstructural scales: macro (entire deformed  volume), meso (grain
              groups) and micro (crystalline  defects).  The scientific goal is to develop a
              multi-axial  constitutive law which reflects the occurrence of  superplastic
              deformation on different microstructural  scales.  Fundamental understanding of
              superplastic behavior  at these different microstructural scales will enable 
              development of quantitative models for superplastic flow.  The balance of
              experimental work with analytical modeling  and the relevance to applied
              problems is excellent.  The  successful performance of this research will have 
              significant engineering impact on the control of industrial  forming
              parameters, reduction in forming temperature and the  development of new
              industrial forming processes.  ***
