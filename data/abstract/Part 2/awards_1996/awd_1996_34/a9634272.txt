Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, addresses  the question of the detailed dynamics of molecules
              photoexcited while adsorbed on transition  metal surfaces.  A nanosecond
              tunable pulsed laser system is used to initiate photodesorption, 
              photofragmentation, and photoreaction of adsorbate molecules such as methane,
              nitrogen, and  carbon monoxide adsorbed on the Pt(111) surface.  Angle resolved
              time of flight mass  spectrometry is used to examine species desorbing into the
              gas phase, and surface analytical  tools are used to examine changes to the
              substrate.  Electron mediated photoprocesses will be  examined by the use of
              alkali adsorbates to lower the work function of the metallic substrate. 
              Detailed information obtained in this research will be useful for our growing
              understanding  of heterogeneous catalysis and photoassisted electronic
              materials processing.  The interaction of light with adsorbed molecules forms
              the primary focus of this research  project supported in the Analytical and
              Surface Chemistry Program.  Laser initiated  processes such as desorption,
              fragmentation, and reaction will be probed by examining the  gas phase product
              of the process as well as changes to the metallic substrate.  Insights into 
              the operation of heterogeneous catalytic systems, as well as mechanistic
              information about  laser assisted processing of electronic materials, should
              result from these studies.
