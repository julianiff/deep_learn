Abstract    :
              Abstract  EEC-9634341  Shortell    The escalating costs of medical care are
              having a significant impact on the economy of the United States.  An
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) on Health Management
              has been formed to conduct research on how effective management of hospitals
              and hospital systems could result in more effective operations and lower costs.
               This I/UCRC involves a consortium of universities headquartered at Arizona
              State University.    This planning meeting will conduct a study to determine if
              Northwestern University can develop sufficient industry or hospital support for
              a study of integrated/organized health care delivery systems.  If sufficient
              support can be developed, the Northwestern University Program will become a
              research site of the I/UCRC for Health Management Research.
