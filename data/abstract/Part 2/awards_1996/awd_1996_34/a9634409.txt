Abstract    :
              PI:  Jenson  IBN:  9634409      The development of mathematical and numerical
              models plays a vital role   in summarizing, interpreting and disseminating
              neuroscience data for the  form and function of the nervous system. These
              modeling efforts attempt to   describe neurophysiological processes at every
              level of description from the   conformational changes of single  ion-channel 
              proteins, to the electrical   properties of  the dendrites and axons of single
              neurons, to the data   processing of large-scale neural networks. Two key
              features of these  various levels of description are that these processes are
              dynamic   and the interaction within and between levels is nonlinear due to a 
              wide variety of feedback mechanisms. Recent mathematical and numerical  
              methods for analyzing such nonlinear dynamical systems offers great   promise
              for studying the models for these neurophysiological processes-   not only to
              provide new ways to organize and understand experimental   data in the
              neurosciences but most importantly to suggest new  ways of looking at complex
              phenomena and to suggest new experiments.   To this end the purpose of this
              proposal is to develop and strengthen  a research collaboration that integrates
              the new theoretical and numerical   tools of nonlinear dynamical systems with
              state of the art experimental   measurments of neurophysiological processes. 
              The proposed collaboration   combines the talents and resources of a
              theoretical physicist with specific   expertise in nonlinear dynamics,  Prof.
              R.V. Jensen at Wesleyan University,   with an outstanding group of
              neuroscientists headed by Prof. G.M. Shepherd at   Yale University.
