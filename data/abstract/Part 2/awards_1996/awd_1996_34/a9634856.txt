Abstract    :
                Laser-induced machining is an excellent alternative to ion beams with distinct
              benefits including patterning by direct writing or optical projection without
              contact masks, higher etch rates, and enhanced surface integrity. This project
              investigates a substitution of ion beam with an electron beam or a laser beam. 
                   This research project will develop a fundamental understanding of
              laser-assisted and liquid-induced reactive machining technique by (1)
              performing nanosecond (ns)-laser chemical vapor-deposited(CVD)-diamond
              polishing and drilling experiments in various liquid media, and (2) by
              experimental diagnosis and theoretical modeling of laser : diamond interaction
              in liquid media.
