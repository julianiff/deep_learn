Abstract    :
              9634773  KATSOUROS    This award is to establish, under the guidance of the
              Ocean  Studies Board (OSB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), a 
              committee to encourage coordination of the major U.S.  oceanographic research
              programs.  The objectives of this  committee will be to provide:         * a
              forum for information sharing and coordinated  implementation of the research
              plans of major ongoing and future  programs,         * a mechanism for
              identifying gaps and overlaps among the  major programs, and         * a means
              to assist the federal agencies and ocean science  community in developing new
              programs that fill the identified  gaps, as well as appropriate follow-on
              activities to the present  generation of programs.
