Abstract    :
              The successful federal HPCC program is in its last phase, establishing the basis
              for Teraflops scale computing systems and applications.  An important finding
              of this historical collaborative program is that many mission critical
              objectives of key Federal agencies require computing capability well beyond
              even that provided by the Teraflops systems of the near future.  Furthermore,
              the challenges to programming and resource management of the largest
              contemporary MPPs has revealed the need for alternative system structures and
              methodologies if very high performance computing is to become an important and
              wide spread enabler of industrial, commercial, government and science
              objectives.  In preparation to establishing future policy and planning
              directions for next generation research programs in advanced computing, a
              number of Federal agencies with compute critical requirements have joined to
              initiate a set of preliminary inquires in the form of workshops, panels, and
              studies.  This grant, made in cooperation with ARPA, DOE, DOD, and NASA, will
              provide funding for two workshops on Petaflop-scale computing.  The first
              workshop will focus on architectures, the second on system software issues. 
              Both will be held in California in summer 1996.
