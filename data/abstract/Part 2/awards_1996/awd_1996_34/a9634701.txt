Abstract    :
              DMI-9634701  Osswald   In most polymer processes the quality of the final part
              stems back in great part to the mixing of the polymer blends and the viscous
              heating that occurs during the process.  Both the material properties and the
              formability of the component into shaped parts are highly influenced by the
              quality of the mixing.  Optimizing mixing processes is time consuming and
              expensive.  It is often necessary to build complex visualization equipment,
              i.e. model extruders with transparent barrels, to qualify the mixing processes.
               This research project will investigate a simulation program and to model the
              mixing phenomena of polymer blends inside complex three dimensional mixing
              devices, such as single and screw extruders.   This project is a NSF GOALI
              project and will be in partnership with 3M Process Development-Polymer
              Processing Laboratory.  The flow visualization experiments will be performed at
              the University of Wisconsin and the twin screw extrusion experiments will be
              carried out at 3M.  Results of this research project could provide valuable
              findings in the optimization of existing processing equipment and development
              of new engineering materials through blending of existing polymers, fillers,
              and solutions.
