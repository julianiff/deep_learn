Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT     The NSF-CBMS regional conference on "Dynamical Systems in
              Structured  Population Dynamics" will be held at the Department of Mathematics,
               North Carolina State University, June 3-8, 1997. Professor J. M. Cushing from 
              the University of Arizona will serve as the principal lecturer of the
              conference.              The conference will focus on a new and exciting area
              of research: structured  population models, their relationship to experimental
              data and their  implications for dynamical systems.  Structured models span the
              gap between  the level of the individual organism and the level of the total
              population.  This direction of research is still in its formative stage and is
              currently under  intense investigation by many mathematicians and mathematical
              biologists.     A major breakthrough occurred last year when Prof. Cushing and
              his  collaborators established nonintuitive complex dynamics in real population
              data.  By controlling laboratory parameters of the flour beetle, they
              demonstrated  complex dynamics including period doubling. Since then, these
              results and their  mathematical implications  have attracted the attention of
              many internationally  renowned researchers.     Prof. Cushing is an excellent
              lecturer and a major contributor to the  area.  With his presentation skills
              and broad view of the subject matter, he  is most appropriate person to give a
              well organized presentation of the major  ideas and recent results, and also
              set the future direction of research in this  field during the course of his
              lectures.
