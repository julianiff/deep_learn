Abstract    :
              9634137  Raufaste  This award is for continued support for the U.S. -Japan Panel
              on  Wind and Seismic Effects which was established in 1968.  Annual  meetings
              alternate between Japan and the U.S.  The Panel develops  technologies and
              strategies that advance engineering design and  construction practices.  The
              Panel is composed of 19 Federal  agencies that  participate in 11 task
              committees.  The task  committees focus on specific issues, e.g., earthquake
              and natural  hazard reduction, passive and active control systems, repair and 
              retrofit of structures, and wind and earthquake engineering of  offshore
              structures.  The results of task committee workshops and  conferences are
              shared at the annual joint meeting and usually  published as proceedings.  ***
