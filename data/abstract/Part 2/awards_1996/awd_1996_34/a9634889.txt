Abstract    :
              9634889  Kao   Wire sawing is a technology that has been used for may years to
              cut stone and wood, but today is used to slice the silicon wafers used in
              photovoltaic cells and semiconductors.  These saws use multiple wires and an
              abrasive slurry to produce thin (on the order of 300-400 micron), relatively
              large diameter (200-300 millimeter) wafers from silicon ingots with excellent
              surface finish.   This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry
              cooperative research project between the State University of New York at Stony
              Brook and GT Equipment Technologies, Inc. will develop models for the wire
              sawing process to design and build the next generation of wire saw capable of
              producing wafers less than 300 microns thick with kerf losses of between
              150-200 microns.  The technical approach will be to develop a mechanics and
              dynamic model of the sawing process that can be used to design a stiffness and
              tension control strategy for improving slicing accuracy.  Experiments and
              unique speckle laser measurement techniques will be used to validate the model
              and control prior to the industrial partner's design of a prototype.       This
              project will provide a fundamental model for this important process in
              electronics manufacture, leading to improved quality and productivity when
              fabricating wafers from silicon ingots.  An integrated design and control
              approach for this equipment promises to reduce waste through both kerf losses
              and defective products, giving a technological lead to equipment manufactures
              competing in global markets.
