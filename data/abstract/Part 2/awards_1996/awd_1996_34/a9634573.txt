Abstract    :
              9634573  Tsai  Based on the recognition that crystal defects are very 
              detrimental to the service life of semiconductor single  crystals, the
              objective of the proposed research is to  develop a nonlinear micromechanical
              finite element model to  calculate the multiplication and motion of
              dislocations in  advanced III-V compound semiconductor single crystals. 
              Thermal stress during crystal growth is identified as the  chief factor in
              causing dislocations to form from the melt  and the proposed model addresses
              this and other related  issues.  The study will be coupled with fluid, heat and
              mass  transport models from NASA Lewis and this represents a very  good
              approach to the overall problem.  This research should  provide a useful
              numeric tool for optimizing the growth of  low density semiconductor single
              crystals which is very  important to the electronics industry.  ***
