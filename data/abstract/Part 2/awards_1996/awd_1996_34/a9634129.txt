Abstract    :
              9634129    Keene  Chemical processes involving sea-salt aerosol in the marine
              boundary layer (MBL)  may significantly impact tropospheric oxidation
              processes; sulfur cycling, radiation  balance and climate; and trace-metal
              fertilization of the surface ocean. Solution pH  controls many chemical
              processes involving atmospheric sea salt. However, acid-base  relationships in
              sea-salt aerosol are very poorly characterized; estimates of aerosol pH  based
              on measurements and models range from <1 to >9.  Reliable measurements  would
              provide critical constraints in resolving the chemical cycling of halogens, 
              sulfur, nitrogen, and trace metals in the MBL.        The specific research
              objectives of this study are: (1) to sample size-segregated  marine aerosol
              during discrete day and night periods and to measure major ionic  constituents;
              (2) to estimate sea-salt aerosol pH as a function of particle size via direct 
              measurements in the field using micro-electrodes, measurement of total
              carbonate in  extracts, and ion-balance analyses; and (3) to assess related
              implications for aqueous-  phase and multi-phase chemical processes in marine
              air.       MBL air will be sampled during late April and May 1997 at the AEROCE
               station on Bermuda. Aerosols will be collected with high-volume cascade
              impactors  over discrete, 12-hour, day or night periods. The concentrations of
              ozone, carbon  monoxide, black carbon, and radon, the ionic composition of bulk
              aerosols, the  physical and optical properties of aerosols, as well as site
              meteorological parameters  will be measured concurrently during all or some
              intervals, and routine air parcel  trajectory calculations will be available.
