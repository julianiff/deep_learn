Abstract    :
              The main emphasis of this research project is to develop  methods for analyzing
              and predicting mid-frequency vibration  transmission in complex structures,
              which are assemblages of  connected substructures. Complex structures are a 
              generalization of periodic and nearly periodic structures.  In the
              mid-frequency range of vibration for a complex  structure, the vibration
              wavelengths are small enough for  uncertainties and flaws in the structure to
              have significant  impact on the global dynamics. The assumptions which 
              currently limit high-frequency statistical energy methods  are systematically
              examined and relaxed. This extends their  applicability to more general systems
              such as those with  strong inter-component coupling. A major thrust in this 
              research effort is on the elimination of assumptions which  restrict the
              analysis to the high-frequency range. The  outcome of this research is a
              hierarchy of new methods for  the vibration analysis of complex structures.
              These new  methods are valid for both mid-and high-frequency ranges,  reproduce
              mode localization and related phenomena caused by  uncertainties, which handle
              moderate and strong coupling  situations, and are relatively simple. The
              methods developed  are validated through systematic comparison with 
              experimental data. Simple benchmark experiments (e.g.,  vibration transmission
              in two coupled plates) are carried  out in the laboratory.
