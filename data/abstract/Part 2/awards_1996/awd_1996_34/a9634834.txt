Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  OPP-9634834  McCartney/Dixon/Savelle        This proposed research
              project will investigate baleen whale bones on precontact and contact Eskimo
              village sites between Barrow and Saint Lawrence Island in northern Alaska. Bone
              elements will be identified to species and size for purposes of reconstructing
              the relative abundance of major species, their ages and sizes at death, and the
              ways they were used by humans. The analysis of mortality profiles in
              zooarchaeological assemblages is important for understanding the relationships
              between human predators and prey species. Further, because the distribution of
              bowheads and gray whales is ice and season dependent, whale abundance or
              scarcity will be related to long-term climatic reconstructions. Comparisons
              will be made with previously analyzed bone assemblages from northern Canada.
