Abstract    :
              The objective of this work is to provide a capability of obtaining a 
              significantly increased resolution for abnormal foci (tumors and knots) in 
              cellular biological tissues by ultrasonic detection.  An ultrasonic transducer 
              array with special electroding is to be designed, tested and its operation 
              evaluated.  This work will look at the electrode patterns and the measurement
              of  the actual beam characteristics using a biological phantom.  Electronic
              circuitry  will be developed for increased sensitivity in data acquisition and
              detection.
