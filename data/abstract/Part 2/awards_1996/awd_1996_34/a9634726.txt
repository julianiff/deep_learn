Abstract    :
              The proposed work deals with the development of a meso-scale modeling framework
              for plasticity of metals and metal matrix composites and the connection between
              the dislocation and the continuum scales. The goal is to identify the
              fundamental aspects at these different scales and to gain understanding of how
              the different scales influence the overall mechanical behavior of materials.
              Scale bridging is not a novel approach but more work needs to be done in this
              area and the proposed work promises to make a significant contribution to the
              field. The ongoing collaboration with Professor Hirth of Washington State
              University and with Dr. Thomson of NIST are definite pluses for the proposed
              research. The proposed work is very ambitious and covers many aspects of
              materials behavior. If successful the outcome of this research will have a
              significant impact on future technological advances in designing and developing
              new materials with desirable engineering properties.
