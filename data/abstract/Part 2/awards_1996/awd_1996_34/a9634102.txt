Abstract    :
              The traditional approach to building and maintaining a system is to build an
              initial system and then deploy it.  Over time, end users identify certain
              performance `inadequacies` or `inconveniences` in the initial system. These
              problems are reported back to the system designer, who collects them, regularly
              rebuilding the system with `improved` performance.  A problem is that the
              design of the system never exactly fits the task environment.  The reason for
              this is in large part due to the pragmatic relations between system, data, and
              user.  In the standard adapted system, information is being gathered about the
              user which is used to modify the interface.  The goal of this research is to
              develop a methodology for building systems that evolve based on the particulars
              of a specific data set.  A method of system adaptation will be explored that is
              based on the history of usage of the system for a given task.  With each
              transaction, the system acquires information about the interaction between the
              user and the system that is subsequently used to adjust the problem-solving
              behavior of the user/system as it applies to that particular data set.  These
              ideas will be developed as they apply to the construction and evolution of an
              online manual system.  The results of the study will be incorporated into a
              methodology for building systems that automatically evolve to the specifics of
              their task environment after they are deployed.
