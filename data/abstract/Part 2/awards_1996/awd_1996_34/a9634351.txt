Abstract    :
              9634351  Srienc  The objective of this conference is to bring together a select 
              group of biochemical engineers and biologists from the United  States and
              Europe to discuss in depth the role mathematical  modeling is playing in the
              area of biochemical engineering and  how its contributions to biotechnology can
              be enhanced in the  future.  This conference will have four technical sessions
              which  include: 91) Characterization of biotic and abiotic phases, (2) 
              Corpuscular models of cell populations, (3) metabolic models, and  (4) modeling
              of complex cellular systems.  The first session will  scope the different
              variables used to characterize: (a) the  biotic phase with regard to their
              experimental measurement as  well as their suitability to describe the
              physiological state of  the cell, and (b) the abiotic phase with regard to
              their  experimental measurement as well as their suitability to describe  the
              rate of change of physiological state of cells in the biotic  phase.  The
              second session will raise issues related to  corpuscular models or statistical
              population balance models which  account for the segregation of biomass among
              distinct cells (or  corpuscles).  The third session will involve a class of
              non-  corpuscular models, i.e. metabolic models, which view biomass as  a
              structured entity.  These models account for internal  regulation of metabolic
              pathways.  This session will address  problems in the application of metabolic
              engineering.  The fourth  session will be devoted to modeling issues connected
              complex  organisms and supracellular systems.
