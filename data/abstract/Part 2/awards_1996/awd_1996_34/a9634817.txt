Abstract    :
              Beatty  9634817  The proposed research is aimed at developing a constitutive 
              model for modeling the Mullins effect, a nonlinear stress  softening phenomenon
              observed in elastomers and soft  biological tissues subjected to repeated
              loading and  unloading.  Both static and dynamic effects of stress  softening
              will be studied analytically to provide insight to  phenomena related to
              difficulties encountered in use of  surgical balloons, to enhance understanding
              of the material  properties of stress softened elastomers and to investigate 
              the Mullins effect in some useful technical applications.  The balance of
              experimental work with modeling and relevance  to applied problems is
              excellent.  The research approach is  novel and likely to yield results of
              significant engineering  importance.  ***
