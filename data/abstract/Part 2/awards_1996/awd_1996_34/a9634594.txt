Abstract    :
                      CTS-9634594        Durning, Turro-Columbia University        SUMMARY    
                 DYNAMIC AND NON-EQUILBRIUM ASPECTS OF POLYMER ADSORPTION        The
              adsorption of flexible macromolecules onto solids plays an important role in
              many technologies because of the dramatic surface modifications caused by the
              adsorption .      Research will be performed on flexible, linear homopolymers
              adsorbing on well-characterized surfaces using four in-situ techniques with
              molecular-level sensitivity: fluorescence spectroscopy, ultrasonic quartz
              crystal resonators, neutron reflection, and pattern photobleaching.  These
              methods will allow a systematic study of elementary dynamic processes in
              adsorbed layers:  osmotic relation (i.e., swelling collapse) and translational
              diffusion of individual adsorbed polymers.  They will also clarify the
              mechanisms controlling adsorption kinetics and exchange of polymers between
              adsorbed and bulk phases.  The experiments will be supplemented by computer
              simulations, providing mechanistic insight ,  The results will supply new
              guidelines for manipulation and control of adsorbed layers, benefiting a
              variety of technologies.  Examples include technologies relying on colloidal
              suspensions where adsorption affects suspension stability and rheology,
              extrusion and molding operations where adsorption on machine surfaces affects
              flow stability and fouling, and in biomedical technologies involving prosthetic
              and blood contacting devices where biopolymer adsorption controls thrombosis
              and cell adhesion.
