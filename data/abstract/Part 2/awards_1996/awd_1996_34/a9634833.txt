Abstract    :
              9634833  Chui   This grant provides funding for an industrial-university
              collaborative project on applications of splines and wavelets to surface
              analysis and synthesis for CAD modeling.  The industrial partner will create an
              opportunity for the participating university researchers and students to work
              on real-world problems under the guidance of industrial experts.  The specific
              goal is to develop and implement an autonomous system for detecting and
              correcting surface waviness, using a spline-based wavelet transform and basis
              functions that constitute the designed surface.    If this project is
              successful, this research will lead to a unified design database tied to a
              single common geometry, thus precluding any unnecessary rework in surface
              design and eliminating costly changes in the hardware development program.  It
              will also lead to a standard surface calculation procedure for the aerospace
              industry that will significantly reduce scheduling time and cost for aircraft
              design and manufacture.  It is expected that other industries, particularly
              automobile, tool, and parts, will benefit from this research on surface
              analysis and sunthesis for CAD modeling.
