Abstract    :
              9634085  Robinson    This research leads to an analysis of the mathematical
              content of sixteen comprehensive, materials development projects in mathematics
              funded by NSF.  The deliverable is a publication that shows for each project
              the mathematics that students who have used the materials should know. 
              Discussions of pedagogical and staff development issues are also provided.  The
              need for such a study is illuminated by the observation that the materials
              developed by these projects place the mathematical topics in various contexts
              that are intended to make the mathematics more meaningful and attract the
              attention of students.  These contexts are very rich and require a careful
              analysis to see all the mathematical topics that are embedded.  For example, on
              the surface the "Cookies" unit from the Interactive Mathematics Program appears
              to be an attempt to introduce mathematical programming, but in fact the purpose
              of the unit is for students to learn how to manipulate equations and how to
              reason using graphs.
