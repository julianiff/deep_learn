Abstract    :
              9634843  Ramasubramani   Paper and paperboard products were the largest of
              component accounting for about 40% of the total municipal solid waste (MSW). 
              The primary problem in recycling of paper is the quality of recycled products,
              including strength and stiffness properties of paper and paperboard, which is
              determined by the dirt count.  The primary causes of dirt count is that the
              xerographic and other non-impact printed inks tend to produce large ink
              particles which are normally too large to be removed by traditional floating
              and centrifugal cleaning techniques.  This project investigates a novel
              technique to address the problem of deinking xerographic and other resin-based
              inks in recycled paper.  This project will identify the process parameters such
              as the effects on incorporating acoustic coaxing induced microcavitation (ACIM)
              recycled fibers in the low-density paper structures through a systematic study.
               A prototype deinking machine with a target deinking rate of 6 pages per minute
              will be studied  and developed for further implementation.   This technique
              takes advantage of the nature of ACIM to release the resin bonded ink flakes
              from paper fibers in a completely chemical free environment,  thus alleviating
              the problems of recyclability of non-impact printed waste and its effect on the
              environment.  The outcome of the research project will provide valuable
              findings for the recycling industry.
