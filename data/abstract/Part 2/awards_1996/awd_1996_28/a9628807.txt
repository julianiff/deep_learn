Abstract    :
              9628807  Behr  The vulnerability of building envelopes have been amply 
              demonstrated during recent extreme wind events which  resulted in damage to
              building interiors, loss of building  functions and great replacement/repair
              costs.  Laminated  glass units have shown significant promise for glazing 
              systems that resist windborne debris impacts.    A computer-based design
              methodology will be developed to  predict the probability of an inner glass ply
              fracture in a  given laminated glass unit under impacts from a design  missile
              traveling at a prescribed speed.  To accomplish  this, a robust structural
              mechanics-based predictive model  for laminated glass units with polyvinyl
              butyral interlayers  will be developed and verified by means of comprehensive 
              laboratory tests.  Project deliverables will include a  computerized design
              package that can be used to design and  develop cost-effective glazing systems
              that exhibit  "sacrificial ply behavior," i.e., the outer glass ply may be 
              fractured, or "sacrificed" to windborne debris impacts, but  the
              interlayer/inner glass ply composite is sufficiently  resilient to protect the
              inner glass ply from fracturing.  Thus, the integrity of the building envelop
              is preserved  during the windstorm.    This project will involve a team of
              civil engineers,  mechanical engineers and statisticians.  Project results 
              will provide the research community with needed data, will  have a significant
              positive impact on mitigating building  envelope damage due to severe
              windstorms, and will benefit  building owners and building insurers in the
              United States.
