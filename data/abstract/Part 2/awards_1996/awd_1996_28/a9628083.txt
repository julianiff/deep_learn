Abstract    :
              9628083  Zindler  This proposal describes a detailed chemical and isotopic study
              of olivine tholeiites and picrites from three main localities in Iceland.  It
              will focus on development of a quantitative understanding of the factors that
              cause variations in the degree of U-Th disequilibrium in these rocks.  The
              principal goal of the project is to explore and quantify the effects of
              variations in the depth of melting and source composition on U-Th
              disequlibrium, absent the complications of age-uncertainty inherent in direct
              investigations of MORBs.  Samples will be collected during field seasons early
              in the first and third years of the project.  In addition, the study will make
              use of existing well-characterized sample suites.  The main stage of data
              acquisition will occur during the first two years and result in detailed
              isotopic and geochemical characterization of approximately 75 samples.  The
              second stage of data acquisition will occur during the third year of the
              project, and will focus on important targets identified by the earlier work. 
              The results of this investigation are expected to lead to substantial
              improvement in the utility of the U-Th method as a tool for studying MORBs and
              other mantle-derived volcanics.
