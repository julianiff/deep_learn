Abstract    :
                This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of eukaryotic
              genetics.  The project investigates the in  vivo requirements for appropriate
              expression of T-cell  specific genes in mice.  The locus control region (LCR) 
              sequences of specific T-cell receptor genes confer a high  level of T-cell
              specific expression of a linked transgene  regardless of position in chromatin.
               The structure and  function of the LCR are being determined to shed light on 
              how the LCR exerts its powerful influence on gene  expression.
