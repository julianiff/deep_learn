Abstract    :
              LOUGHIN  DMS-9628643  The Department of Statistics at Kansas State University
              will  purchase a distributed statistical computing system with data  warehouse
              capability.  The equipment will be used for several  research projects,
              including in particular:  (1)  A Permutation  Test for Split Plot Experiments
              with a Single Replication of the  Whole Plot Experimental Units; (2) Maximin
              Clusters for Near  Replicate Regression Lack of Fit Tests; (3) A Bootstrap
              Approach  to Likelihood Ratio Tests For Joint Likelihood Ratio Ordering;  and
              (4) A Procedure for Detecting a Dominant Set of Cells Within  a Multinomial
              Distribution.
