Abstract    :
              9628835  ROGERS  The recent rapid increase in the use of DNA data for estimating
              phylogenetic or genealogical relationships of genes and organisms has focused
              attention on the efficiency of various methods for doing this.  Several studies
              have demonstrated that a method known as "maximum likelihood" is often equal or
              superior to other methods for finding correct relationships.  Maximum
              likelihood, however, has been hampered by the extreme slowness of the computer
              programs for its implementation.  Other doubts regarding its usefulness have
              also been raised.  Preliminary studies have shown that maximum likelihood
              computer programs may be speeded up considerably by using fast approximate
              methods.  These studies have also indicated that other supposed problems of
              maximum likelihood may not be serious.  In this study, James S. Rogers, in
              collaboration with David L. Swofford of the Laboratory of Molecular
              Systematics, Smithsonian Institution, will evaluate these aspects of maximum
              likelihood.  Useful methods that result from the proposed studies will be
              incorporated into subsequent revisions of PAUP*, Swofford's widely used
              software package for phylogenetic analysis.
