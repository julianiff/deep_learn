Abstract    :
              9628007  Kirschvink    This grant provides $65,287 as one-half support of the
              cost of  acquiring a new 2G Enterprises Direct-Current (DC) superconducting 
              magnetometer (SQuID) for the Department of Geology at the  California Institute
              of Technology.  The instrument will replace an  antiquated radio-frequency (Rf)
              SQuID that has a high potential for  failure.  The new instrument will provide
              much greater sensitivity  and broader dynamic range than the Rf-SQuID and
              result in a  significant reduction in lab operating costs due to the DC-SQuID's
               much more efficient use of liquid helium.  This acquisition will  allow the PI
              to continue his extremely well-respected research in  geomagnetism and
              biomagnetism and will provide a valuable resource  to the frequent users of
              this laboratory.  ***
