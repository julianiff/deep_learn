Abstract    :
              9628606  Sideris    The Department of Mathematics at the University of
              California, Santa Barbara will purchase a Sun SPARC 20 workstation server, 5
              Sun SPARC 5 workstations, and hardware for the creation of a fiber optic
              network link which will be dedicated to the support of research in the
              mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for several research
              projects, including in particular: computations of electron microstructures,
              computations of attractors of nonlinear wave equations, electromagnetic
              calculation for physical design of mixed signal modules, virtual Betti numbers
              and similarity interval exchange maps, and numerical simulation of rotationally
              symmetric three-dimensional ideal fluids.
