                                        ABSTRACT    PI:  Hoogland  Proposal Number:  9628887  
                 Because they radically modify the vegetation and are the  primary food for
              numerous predators, prairie dogs are  important members of the ecosystem of
              Western North America.  However, shooting, poisoning, and destruction of
              habitat  have drastically reduced prairie dog populations, and two  species are
              threatened with extinction.  Information  necessary for the conservation of
              prairie dogs will result  from the proposed research.    In certain prairie dog
              populations, mothers sometimes kill  the unweaned offspring of other mothers. 
              Such infanticide  sometimes accounts for the elimination of as many as 22% of 
              all Litters born.  Research to investigate infanticide will  be conducted with
              several prairie dog populations.    Prairie dog colonies crash after outbreaks
              of bubonic  plaque.  Information on this important source of  mortality  will
              result from tracking of colonies that were ravaged by  plaque in 1995.
