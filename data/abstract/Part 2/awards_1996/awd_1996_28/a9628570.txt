Abstract    :
              9628570  Tanahoco   This SGER project focuses on the development of
              next-generation material handling systems for ultra-flexible factories.  This
              effort will be carried out in collaboration with representatives from
              Australia, Europe, and Japan.  This project will spearhead United States (U.S.)
              involvement in this area.   This project is a small exploratory venture into an
              emerging research area characterized by next-generation factory configurations
              based on operational control strategies that are metamorphic in nature.  It
              represents an initiative that will investigate, at an international level, the
              evolution of concepts driven by the NSF Intelligent Materials Handling
              Initiative.  United States (U.S.) participation will concentrate on aspects
              related to flexible layouts and tool movements as opposed to part movement.
