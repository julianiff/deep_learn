Abstract    :
              Reddy, Sunita P  Clark University   When both a state and a local community
              claim rights over the same resource by appealing to customary or statutory law,
              territorial conflict may arise.  The study will investigate territorial
              conflict between the state and common property regimes in two Guatemalan pine
              forests: San Francisco El Alto and San Jose La Arada.  The objectives of the
              proposed  study are to determine how territorial conflict between states and
              communities affects governance of resources, whether variation in customary law
              is a significant influence on the mode of conflict negotiation utilized and the
              social and environmental outcomes of conflict negotiation.  The extended
              comparative study will employ in-depth interviews of key informants,
              semi-structured surveys, participant observation, oral histories and times
              series analyses of aerial photographs.  The result will contribute to further
              knowledge on the relationships between property regime dynamics and landscape
              change in tropical forests.
