Abstract    :
              Ilan Benjamin, University of California Santa Cruz, is funded by a grant   from
              the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his  
              theoretical work in the study of molecular dynamic simulations of   chemical
              reactions at liquid interfaces.  Equilibrium and non-equilibrium   molecular
              dynamics computer simulations and continuum electrostatic and   diffusion
              models will be used to investigate how the unique   characteristics of the
              interface affect the behavior of several   chemically reactive systems.  The
              problems to be studied include: 1)   solute accommodation and reactions at the
              water liquid/vapor interface;   2) gauche-trans isomerization reactions at the
              liquid/vapor interface of   liquid mixtures; 3) transfer of large hydrophobic
              ions across the   liquid/liquid interface; and 4) ion pairing at the
              electrochemical   liquid/liquid interface.  An important challenge in the field
              of chemistry is to understand at the   molecular level the effect of the
              solvent medium on chemical reactions.    Most chemical reactions of commercial
              importance occur in solution and   are frequently carried out in the presence
              of a catalyst.  Recent   development of a number of condensed phase
              experimental techniques, such   as femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy and
              non-linear spectroscopy,   have provided new information on chemistry at the
              liquid-vapor and   liquid-liquid interfaces.  Benjamin's theoretical work will
              help to   provide a molecular level interpretation of this new experimental  
              information.
