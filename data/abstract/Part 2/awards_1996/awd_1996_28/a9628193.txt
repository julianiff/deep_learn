Abstract    :
                This project takes a broad information-theoretic approach to the exchange  of
              information over a network of many users in the presence of interference  and
              noise. The problems considered include:  distributed transmission and 
              reception of information;  distributed computation; distributed 
              data-compression; the cooperative use of distributed data;  the role of 
              feedback in communication networks; the theoretical contrast of CDMA, TDMA  and
              FDMA in mobile communication environments; and the investigation of 
              distortion-free rate distortion theory.  Also considered are certain 
              information-theoretic questions concerning: speech processing;  speech 
              recognition;  data compression; investment; energy bounds for computation;  and
              thermodynamics.  It may also be possible to show the formal identity of 
              rate-distortion theory and investment theory and ultimately to demonstrate 
              that the work in universal data compression can apply directly to universal 
              investment algorithms.  The research seeks a unified view of distributed 
              communication and data processing.  Steps toward such a theory should have 
              good practical applications, as recent advances in CDMA and universal data 
              compression attest.
