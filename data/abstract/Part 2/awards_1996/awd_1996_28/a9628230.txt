Abstract    :
              Birkeland, Karl W  Arizona State University   This project will investigate the
              variability of snowpack properties as a function of terrain and will examine
              also the relationship between snowpack data and snow stability throughout a
              mountain range.  The study site is the Bridger Mountains, Montana.  Sampling
              teams will collect data three times during the season.  Data on snowpack
              stability, strength, depth, and temperature will be compared with terrain
              features such as aspect, elevation, slope angle, and location within the
              mountain range.  In addition weekly data will be collected at a study plot in
              order to assess the evolution of the snowpack.  A variety of multivariate
              statistical methods will be used to test hypotheses.  Snowpack variations are
              hypothesized to occur in patterns that can be correlated to terrain.  In
              addition it is hypothesized that detailed data from a point can be used to
              approximate the condition of nearby slopes.  Results will show the association
              between snowpack and terrain at a scale that has yet to be examined.  The
              product will contribute to a more general knowledge of avalanche events and
              their causes.  In addition the results will have practical utility for
              avalanche professionals.
