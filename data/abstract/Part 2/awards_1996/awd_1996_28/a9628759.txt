              Abstract  ATM-9628759  Feng, Xiahong  Dartmouth College  Title:
              Dendrochronological and Stable Isotope Studies of Tree-Rings for Selected Areas
              of the United             States     Tree-ring techniques have been
              increasingly used for climate and   paleoecological studies with time scales of
              hundreds to thousands of   years. The record of stable isotopes in tree-rings
              may provide detailed   information about present and past climate.  This
              project is designed   to study the climatic implications of stable isotopes in
              annual   tree-rings and to address the basic analytical and interpretive issues
                related to this methodology.  This award will address the   signal-to-noise
              ratios of the isotopic records and the fundamental   question of replication:
              can reasonably homogenous hydrogen and oxygen   isotope chronologies be
              developed from several trees at a single site?   The project will also focus on
              the effects of tree age and   microenvironment on the derivation of
              climatically- sensitive isotope   chronologies.
