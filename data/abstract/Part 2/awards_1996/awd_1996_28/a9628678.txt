Abstract    :
              9628678  Leinenweber  The proposed research focuses on the recovery of several
              unquenchable phases which are of long-standing interest in mineral physics. A
              primary target will be unquenchable CaSiO3 perovskite. Low temperature x-ray
              and spectroscopic studies will be performed on this phase to determine details
              of its structure and dynamics. Another target synthesis will be of the high
              pressure monoclinic for of SiO2 cristobalite, for structure solution and
              refinement of x-ray and neutron diffraction. Low temperature Raman and x-ray
              studies of the baddeleyite phase Ca(OH)2 will be performed.  Also targeted are
              unquenchable FeTiO3 perovskite and related compounds such as MnTiO3 perovskite,
              and high pressure AlPO4. The studies proposed here are non-destructive, so the
              sample will also be available for further work.
