Abstract    :
              9628749  Shimizu    This grant provides $538,966 as partial support of costs of 
              salaries, equipment and supplies associated with the continued  operation of
              the North East Regional Ion Microprobe Facility  (NERIMF) at the Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution over the next  three years.  Previous support of this
              facility was solely for the  operation and maintenance of a Cameca ims 3f ion
              microprobe.   Support for the development of operational techniques on their 
              newly acquired,state-of-the-art, Cameca ims 1270 ion microprobe  (EAR-9214641)
              is included in this awards for facility support.  The  two-machine operation
              will be under the direct supervision of  Nobumichi Shimizu at Woods Hole but
              the ims 1270 was purchased  through contributions from a partnership of
              institutions including,  Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), the
              American Museum of  Natural History (AMNH), Brown University, Lamont-Doherty
              Earth  Observatory (LDEO), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)  and
              Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) so that early technique  development on
              the ims 1270 will include PI's from these  institutions as well as WHOI.  This
              award represents a modest  increase (ca 9%) over their current level of support
              for operation  and maintenance of the ims 3f, yet development of techniques 
              utilizing the ims 1270 will be the primary thrust of this group  over the next
              three years.  Specifically, outside user access to  the ims 1270 will be
              restricted for the first 27 months to allow  the partnership to pursue
              technique developments including, in situ  measurement of U/Pb ratios in
              zircons for geochronologic  investigations, measurement of isotopic ratios of
              elements in the  U-series disequilibria in Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalts as
              indicators of  the petrologic history of these magmas and high precision 
              measurements of the Sr/Ca ratio recorded in corals at very high  resolutions
              (sub-annual to possibly sub-weekly) as proxies of paleo  sea surface
              temperatures in paleoclimatologic studies.  A dditional  work will focus on the
              development of standards for both U/Pb  zircon geochronology and for trace
              elemental analyses.  Analyses of  trace element ratios in biogenic carbonates
              at micro-scale spatial  resolution will allow unprecedented determination of
              records of  global change.  While the ims 1270,due to its high mass resolution 
              and high transmission is uniquely suited to studies of U-series  isotopic
              ratios as well as high spatial resolution elemental  analyses of
              environmentally important trace elements (i.e. Cu, Zn,  Pb) in biogenic
              carbonates, the ims 3f will continue to provide for  the analytical
              determination of trace elemental abundances in  geological samples where the
              high sensitivity of the ims 1270 is  not critical.  ***
