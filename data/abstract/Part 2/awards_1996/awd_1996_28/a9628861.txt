Abstract    :
                96-28861  Fei    Abstract    The PIs propose to constrain experimental
              laboratory studies of stable hydrous silicate  phases with seismological data
              to test whether dehydration weakening in subducting slabs  causes moderate- and
              deep-focus earthquakes.  The program is aimed at understanding the  role of
              hydrous phases in intermediate and deep-focus earthquakes through high pressure
               and temperature simulation experiments in the laboratory.  They will
              experimentally  determine the existence of hydrous phases for P-T conditions
              expected within the descending  slab, the maximum dehydration pressures of
              hydrous phases in both simple MgO-SiO2-H2O  and complex hydrous peridotite
              systems, and the dehydration/melting temperatures of  hydrous peridotite as a
              function of pressure (depth).  The PIs also propose to compare the 
              characteristics of oceanic lithosphere seismicity to evaluate the hypothesis
              that intermediate-  and deep-focus events occur on faults that were initally
              formed in oceanic lithosphere   before subduction.  ***
