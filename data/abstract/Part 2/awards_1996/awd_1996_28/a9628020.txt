Abstract    :
              9628020  Hedlin     This research is to analyze global network recordings of 
              precursors to the inner core seismic phase PKPdf in order to  directly image
              lateral and vertical variations in short period  scattering strength at or near
              the core-mantle boundary (CMB).   Results to date have produced evidence for
              large scale variations  in scattering strength near the CMB.  This work will
              investigate  inversion techniques that will form images of scattering strength 
              that are less subject to travel time ambiguities.  Resolution  analysis will
              especially concentrate on distinguishing between  scatters at core entry and
              exit points and within the D" layer just  above the CMB.    ***
