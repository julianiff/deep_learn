Abstract    :
              9628209  Cameron  The PI's propose a combined SHRIMP and IDTIMS U/Pb zircon
              study of granulites from Kilborne Hole in order to get the complete and precise
              geochronological information required to unravel the evolution of the deep
              crust beneath the Rio Grande rift. The PI's will refine applications of the
              Lu/Hf system to dating processes such as melting and metamorphism in rocks
              affected by these processes. Granulite xenoliths from Kilborne Hole are ideal
              for these U/Pb zircon and Lu/Hf geochronology studies because (1) they are
              abundant and relatively large, (2) a previous Sm/Nd study by Cameron suggests
              that crust formation and modification can be documented over a long time
              interval (1700 Ma to Cenozoic), and (3) the PI's previous Lu/Hf study has
              demonstrated that some of the garnet-bearing granulites were affected by
              Cenozoic events. The quality of the data will probably be needed in general for
              further advances in the understanding of deep crustal processes through the
              study of granulite xenoliths.
