Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Tien  9628673       The proposal is to partially support an
              international conference on molecular and microscale transport processes. This
              research area has recently developed very rapidly because of the possibilities
              for significant advances in microelectronics and biotechnology.  The conference
              will bring together participants from industry and university both from the
              United States and from Japan.
