Abstract    :
              9628552  Metcalf   The Trinity terrane, in the eastern Klamath Mountains of
              California, lies between an early Devonian subduction-related trench and an
              immature early Devonian volcanic island arc, and constitutes the largest
              exposure of ultramafic rock in North America.  However, lithologic and
              geochemical data are complex, with disparate implied tectonic  environments. 
              The project will test three current models to explain these rocks (single
              section of oceanic lithosphere, back-arc basin or a variant  such as a
              supra-subduction zone origin).  The main goals are to determine the age and
              duration of magmatism, determine the petrogenesis and tectonic setting of the
              mafic intrusive complexes, and to attempt to identify ultradepleted mantle that
              is coeval with the mafic-intrusive complexes as predicted by the favored model.
               Results have the potential to provide a unifying explanation for all lower
              Paleozoic lithotectonic elements in the eastern Klamath Mountains in which all
              three terranes evolved doing a single convergent margin tectonic episode.
