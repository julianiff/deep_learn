Abstract    :
              9628693  Banerjee      This grant provides $824,994 as continued support  for
              the Institute for Rock Magnetism (IRM) at the  University of Minnesota. 
              Current facility support  through the EAR/IF program (EAR-9304363) will  expire
              in early FY 97 and this grant will provide  an additional three years of
              support at an annual  level of approximately $275,000, which will  primarily be
              used as salary support for IRM  personnel including 5 senior personnel, support
              of  a post doctoral researcher and modest equipment  upgrades including upgrade
              of their  superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM), Mossbauer  spectrometer,
              Kappa susceptibility bridge and a  magnetic force microscope (MFM).  Funds will
              also  cover travel expenses associated with their  visiting fellows program and
              their advisory  committee and materials and supplies associated  with the
              production and distribution of their  quarterly newsletter and basic operations
              of this  facility.  The IRM has, over the last six years  under support from
              the EAR/IF program, established  a facility of state-of-the-art equipment used
              to  advance our knowledge of basic and applied rock  magnetism, for
              paleomagnetic research aimed at  unraveling earth system history and climatic 
              variability, and to gain further insight into  plate tectonic motions and the
              geodynamo.  Specific research has included studies of the rock  magnetic
              properties of Chinese Loess, the rock  magnetic characterization of
              remagnitized  Paleozoic strata in the Appalachians and the  craton interior,
              studies of biogenic magnetite and  examination of the fidelity of magnetic
              remanence.  With support for EAR/IF, the IRM makes available  these instruments
              at no charge to the earth  science community both with the U.S. and abroad.
