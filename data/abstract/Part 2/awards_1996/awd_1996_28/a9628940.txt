Abstract    :
              Lowe, Celia  Yale University   Bajau peoples of the Togian Islands, Sulawesi,
              Indonesia are dependent upon marine resources for subsistence livelihoods. 
              Management of such resources are based on the need for their utilization in
              livelihood.  This research will document the convergence on Togian marine
              environments of extra-local forces for change and the impingement of these
              forces on local marine resource use.  It will also explore dual processes of
              Bajau identity construction within these fields of shifting power relations and
              the effects of the relations on the biophysical spaces of marine environments. 
              Extra local development plans typically overlay diverse local traditions
              including the regulation of marine resource space by coastal zone dwellers. 
              The research, through ethnographic and archival field work, will explore the
              ways competing visions of spatial usage become reflected in biophysical
              environments and the implications of Bajau experiences with state and
              conservation programs for their use of sea products.  The research will produce
              additional information on the social construction of nature and will contribute
              to knowledge concerning the state and conservation practice as reflected by
              local peoples survival on the margins of centralized state power.
