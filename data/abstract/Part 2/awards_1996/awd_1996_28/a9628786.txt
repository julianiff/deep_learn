Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop and test fault  tolerant algorithms
              for numerical computation in various  domains, including sparse matrices,
              recursive filtering and  signal processing.  The methods used are a combination
              of  checks made during the computation based on preconditioned  checksums and
              thresholds, and a-posteriori checks made on  the final computed results based
              on backward error  assertions (BEAs).  In spite of the presence of rounding 
              errors, BEAs allow very tight, cheap, validation of the  final results
              independent of the specifics of the  implementation or sources of error, and
              checksums and  thresholds supplement the BEAs by providing checks during  the
              computation.  These methods will be extended beyond  prototype examples to more
              realistic large computations,  demonstrating their scalability and
              applicability to large  domains.***
