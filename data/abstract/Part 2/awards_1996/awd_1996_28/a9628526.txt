Abstract    :
              HRD-9628526  Cal State LA University Auxiliary    "Theoretical Studies of
              Nanowires Inside Carbon Nanotubes"    We propose to carry out a research
              program to investigate the  stability conditions of chains of different
              materials inside carbon  nanotubes, of various chiralities and diameters, by
              employing  first-principles, total-energy calculations within the local 
              density functional approach.  Chains of different types of  materials will be
              considered, namely, transition metals, Sulfur,  Selenium, and Tellurium, and
              lastly, polysulfur nitride.  Some  transition metals were shown experimentally
              to form continuous  nanowires inside carbon nanotubes.  S, Se, and Te have a
              propensity  to form semiconducting chains, and the polymer (SN)x is known to be
               a superconductor below 0.3 K.  The electronic energy bands of these  composite
              systems, and the amount of charge transfer between the  chains and carbon
              atoms, will be calculated.  The resultant shifts  in the vibrational mode
              frequencies of the carbon nanotubes will be  estimated.    Four students from
              minority groups underrepresented in Physics,  specifically, African-American,
              Hispanics, and women, will be  involved in this project.  This will be greatly
              beneficial to their  future education and career.  ***
