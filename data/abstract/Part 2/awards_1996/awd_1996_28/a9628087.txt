Abstract    :
              9628087  Van Der Hilst    This research involves improved tomographic imaging of
              the  Earth's mantle to enable a systematic study of subducting  lithospheric
              slabs.  The tomographic imaging is to be integrated  with plate tectonic
              reconstructions and fluid dynamical modeling.   Prior work included
              reprocessing of the entire catalogue of the  International Seismological
              Centre, including non-linear hypocenter  relocation and phase
              re-identification; this has resulted in a data  quality that is improved
              relative to that used previously in global  travel-time tomography.  The
              current project will use this data for  the global imaging for both
              high-resolution regional models and  whole mantle models.  The primary goal is
              to produce seismic  velocity models with sufficient resolution for a systematic
               investigation of lithospheric slabs world wide, in particular the  depth of
              penetration of the slabs throughout the lower mantle.  The  resulting velocity
              models will then be tested in the context of  numerical flow simulations and
              the history of plate motions.    ***
