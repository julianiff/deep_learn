Abstract    :
                9628762  Wang    An International Conference on Molecular Beam Epitaxy(MBE) is
              being held to address new,  more microscopic aspects of MBE phenomena. 
              Chemical kinetic reactions and mechanisms in  critical aspects of interfaces,
              thin film surface evolution and continuous film development  during early
              stages of epitaxy of both compound and elemental semiconductors ar  e being
              addressed through advanced processing and characterization techniques being
              studied  by  a new generation of young scientists.  Current topics in
              semiconductor materials growth  under lattice mismatch conditions, and related
              in situ advanced materials characterization  are an integral part of the
              conference.  There will be an opportunity to a  ssess the field, and to
              establish ties between universities, research institutions, and  industry.  It
              is expected that top scientists in the field will attend, and that the 
              Conference will provide an effective forum to discuss and delineate critical
              scientific  issues in this important research area, and to consider and define
              the approaches and te  chniques needed to address them.  %%%   An evaluation of
              the progress and status of Molecular Beam Epitaxy and related materials 
              processing and characterization issues, especially critical materials research
              areas of  hetero-epitaxy, processing, and the relationship of materials
              research to device and  circuit fabrication along with current assessments of
              the most important developments  in this field will be of great value to the
              understanding and enhanced utilization of  advanced materials in the field of
              electronics and photonics.  ***      _
