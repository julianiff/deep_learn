Abstract    :
                      9628245  Carey   The P.I. will model sea water intrusion in southern
              Baldwin County, Alabama.  This study necessarily requires a region where there
              are sufficient data for model inputs.  Baldwin County is a rapidly growing
              region of the Gulf Coast and like many coastal areas, relies primarily on
              groundwater as its source of potable water.  Because of the importance of
              groundwater to this region, there has been a wealth of data collected. 
              Available data include well water levels, water chemistry, pumping rates and
              surveys of water uses.  Other data available include aquifer parameters like
              hydraulic conductivity.  A calibrated seawater intrusion model of southern
              Baldwin county will be used in an inverse manner to determine the flux of fresh
              water flowing through the system and escaping to the ocean.  The Alabama Gulf
              Coast is a region typical of the earth's passive continental margins.  Many of
              the estuarine deposits which were formed during sequential incising and
              excising of the coast during sea level rise and lowering have been preserved as
              hard bottom deposits here.  This initially local study will provide insight
              into much of the world's passive continental margins and the fresh groundwater
              fluxes onto them.
