Abstract    :
                This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of developmental
              biology.  Zebra fish will be used as a  model system to study early development
              of the vertebrate  heart.  A mutant zebra fish which develops two hearts will 
              be studied to determine how many genes are involved and if  they regulate cell
              migration and/or adhesion.  Using a  variety of techniques of molecular
              biology, attempts will be  made to identify the genes involved in heart
              organogenesis.
