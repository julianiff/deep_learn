Abstract    :
              9628195  Jacobsen  This project is to determine the 187Os/186Os ratios in
              continental crust materials (primarily river suspended loads) to constrain the
              Os isotopic composition of the continental crust. The PI's will establish the
              187Os/186Os variations in relation to the 143Nd/144Nd variations in continental
              materials. The results will be used to constrain models of crust-mantle
              differentiation and crustal recycling into the mantel, to provide constraints
              on the Os isotopic composition of the bulk silicate Earth, and to conduct mass
              balance considerations for the Os isotopic variations in crust and mantle
              reservoirs. Measurements will be carried out by N-TIMS isotope dilution
              methods. Data will be obtained on well characterized samples. The PIs will
              develop geochemical models for the budgets of Re and Os and their relation to
              the incompatible, lithophile elements in the depleted mantle, continental
              crust, and other potentially significant reservoirs in the silicate Earth. The
              ultimate goal is to understand the geochemical behavior of Re and Os in the
              Earth's crust-mantle system and the utility of this system as a tracer for
              crust-mantle evolution processes.
