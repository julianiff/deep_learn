Abstract    :
              119628474  Humphreys    This research involves the completion of analysis of
              results from  the Snake River Plain, Idaho, project.  This project involved the
               emplacement and recording of seismic data from 28 PASSCAL portable  seismic
              systems over a 10 month period in 1993-1994 to delineate  the upper mantle and
              crust of the Snake River Plain, a volcanic  feature that is the result of the
              passage of the Yellowstone Hot  Spot across the northwestern U.S.  The need for
              additional funds is  in part a result of the success of the experiment and the 
              acquisition of much more usable data than was anticipated because  of a high
              success rate for data recording and a high number of  usable seismic events
              during the recording interval.  The results  will bear on questions of what
              happens to upper mantle structure  and earthquake occurrence when a hot spot
              traverses through a  region of continental crust.  This research is a component
              of the  National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
