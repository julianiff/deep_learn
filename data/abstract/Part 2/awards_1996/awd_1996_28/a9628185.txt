Abstract    :
                This is an investigation of the adaptive and robust design of transmit 
              signals for wireless transmission paths.  The objective is to determine 
              fundamental design methods that will allow reliable transmission at data  rates
              several times faster than are presently achievable by adaptively  contouring
              the transmit signals to match channel conditions. Time-varying  and/or
              broadcast wireless transmission paths create special challenges for  such
              adaptive transmission design that at present have not been solved.  The project
              first studies transmission on fixed broadcast channels where  feedback to the
              transmitter is not allowed and principles of robust signal  design need to be
              derived to improve reliably transmitted data rates.  Study then encompasses
              time-variation through both well known and new  models for both broadcast and
              interactive time-varying (mobile) channels.  The focus then shifts to
              generalization to multiuser coordinated  transmission technologies.  Extension
              and generalization of multi-tone  waveforms which are very successful on
              wireline channels will be treated in  these new and more challenging contexts.
