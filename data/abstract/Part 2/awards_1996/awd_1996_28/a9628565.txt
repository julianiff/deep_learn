Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Siegel of the  
              Department of Chemistry at the University of California--San Diego will  
              investigate the chemistry of three nanomolecular morphologies. The focus   of
              this work is the computational design, synthesis and characterization   of
              Stem-Palmate Clusters, Entwined Networks of Cyclophanes, and Aromatic   Shells
              and Curved Surfaces. Particular attention is to be paid to the   stereochemical
              characteristics of the above systems.   New synthetic materials developed in
              chemical laboratories range in size   from a small (10 angstrom) molecules to
              very large compounds such as   polymers that are 100 angstroms long. This
              investigation focuses on   intermediate systems referred to as nanomolecules
              (10-100 angstoms).   Computer aided design followed by synthesis will provide a
              myriad of   molecular motifs that are useful in biosensors, optical materials
              and   liquid crystals. The three dimensional character of these systems is of  
              particular importance.
