Abstract    :
              The PI on this project will collect rust fungi in the Atlantic Rain Forest
              Domain in Brazil over a three-year period and prepare information-rich
              herbarium specimens, conduct training of graduate students in the taxonomy of
              rust fungi, and produce electronic databases for use in further research on
              Brazilian rust fungi.  The fungi as a group are very poorly known, and among
              fungi, the rusts are even more neglected, even though they are responsible for
              serious diseases of economically important plants. The PI has over 30 years of
              experience with this group of organisms, and will use his expertise to collect
              more than 1800 new specimens of rust fungi that will be deposited at four major
              herbaria both in Brazil and in the U.S.  These specimens will be an excellent
              resource for future workers, as will the electronic database that will also
              result from this study.  The collecting areas have been selected within the
              Atlantic Rain Forest Domain, an endangered ecosystem type (less than 5-10% of
              the original extent of this biome exists today), which makes the documentation
              of fungal biodiversity that this project will produce urgently needed.  -- a▌к
