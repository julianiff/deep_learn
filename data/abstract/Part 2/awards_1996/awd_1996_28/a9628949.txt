Abstract    :
              ***  9628949  Malone       This grant provides funding for research leading to
              the establishment of a knowledge base  for agile manufacturing.  The purpose of
              the knowledge base will be to collect and disseminate  knowledge about agile
              manufacturing and other agile business practices.  The project will  develop
              conceptual methodologies and software tools to help gather, codify, organize,
              and  distribute information on agile manufacturing practices.  The primary
              objectives of this research  are to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
              approach and to develop the tools and methods  to expand and maintain an
              agility knowledge base.  This research will build on the Process  Handbook
              project, which is developing methodologies for analyzing business processes and
              an  on-line repository of business process descriptions, and the Intelligent
              Information Infrastructure  Project, which is developing tools for facilitating
              large scale electronic discussions and for  accumulating bodies of knowledge
              and experience.       If successful, this research will augment ongoing
              activities in the area of agile  manufacturing.  It should enable the
              collection of information from several agile manufacturing  projects and
              provide for the dissemination of that information within the projects
              themselves and  to industry seeking to implement agile practices.  The overall
              objective of the agile  manufacturing projects is to increase the productivity
              and profitability of U.S. industry.  ***
