              9628899    This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research  Fellowship
              for 1996.    This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of
              prokaryotic genetics, specifically an analysis of  duplicated DNA sequences
              subjected to premeiotic  methylation.    The mushroom Coprinus cinereus is used
              in this study because  genes are normally present in only one copy per nucleus,
               duplicated sequences are methylated premetotically in  crosses, and
              methylation effects are detectable in the veil  cells of the mushroom cap. 
              This unique organism is ideally  suited for studying premiotic homology search
              in cell  division.  Genes have been isolated from the mushroom which  are
              necessary both for survival after gamma irridation and  for meiosis.  These
              mutants are being used to study the role  of MIP, methylation indued
              premeiotically, in meiotic  chromosome pairing and synapsis.
