Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, Breckenridge will examine the spectroscopy and   dynamics
              of van der Waals clusters of the type MXn, where M is an atom,   typically a
              Group II, III or IV metal, and X is a rare-gas atom or a   molecule.  The
              complexes will be made in a supersonic jet and will be   characterized by
              laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), resonant two-photon   photoionization
              spectroscopy (R2PI), and laser pump-probe `action`   spectroscopy.    One goal
              of this research program is to understand better the nature of   electronic
              interactions between atoms and C-H bonds in molecules as a   function of atomic
              electronic state.  Particularly interesting will be   the transition region
              between physical and chemical interactions.  One   application of this work is
              as a model for catalytic C-H bond activation   at solid metal-oxide sites.
