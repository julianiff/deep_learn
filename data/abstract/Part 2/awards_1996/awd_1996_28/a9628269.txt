Abstract    :
              9628269  Philpotts  It is proposed to investigate four different profiles
              through the Holyoke basalt using chemical analyses to define the degree of
              compaction and the partial melting technique to enhance textures for
              petrographic analysis.  During compaction, the abundances of minerals and
              residual liquid change, but these phases are difficult to identify precisely in
              a thin section of crystalline rock.  Yet it is important to know not only the
              abundance of liquid at a given stage of compaction, but also its distribution. 
              In preliminary experiments on the Holyoke basalt, the P.I. found that by partly
              melting a sample, a clear picture of the amount and distribution of residual
              liquid can be obtained as a function of temperature.  The experiments show that
              the crystal mush consisted of a network of chains of refractory minerals
              surrounding channels of liquid.  In the experiment, the intrinsic permeability
              of the mush could also be determined.  When applied to rocks that have
              undergone different degrees of compaction, the technique has the potential of
              determining how the solids and liquid redistributed themselves during
              compaction and thus of revealing the mechanisms involved.  The results will
              provide quantitative data on the mechanisms and rates of compaction of crystal
              mush formed from quartz tholeiitic magma.  Although determined with data from a
              surface flood-basalt flow, the results will be applicable to processes acting
              in the earth.
