Abstract    :
              Lindahl, David  U. of Washington  In recent decades the commercial real estate
              industry has undergone important structural transformations, including
              globalization of capital sources, the globalized securitization of assets, and
              the development of new types of financial intermediaries.  There have been
              major changes in sources of capital being used to fuel the investment process. 
              This proposal will develop a technical approach to document the behavior of key
              institutions making commercial real estate capital supply decisions.  It will
              aim to develop an understanding of the consequences of these actions in
              selected regional economies.  The survey entails an investigation of major
              suppliers of capital to the real estate industry as well as local investment
              players in four metropolitan areas.  In addition the research will include case
              studies of specific commercial properties in the metropolitan areas to examine
              the local outcomes of these global processes.  The results will improve of
              knowledge of the investment mechanisms at work and their consequences in such
              markets.
