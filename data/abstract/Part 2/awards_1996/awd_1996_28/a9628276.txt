Abstract    :
                  The Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC) is an ensemble  of 16
              small computer science research conferences, symposia and  workshops, sponsored
              by four different professional societies and  colocated in Philadelphia, PA
              from May 20 through 28, 1996.  Many  of the constituent meetings are held on an
              annual basis. The  purpose of the Federated Conference is to stimulate
              interaction  among scientists in sub-disciplinary areas who might otherwise 
              not communicate with one another. Registrants at FCRC are allowed  and
              encouraged to attend any and all sessions of the constituent  meetings. The
              first FCRC was held in 1993 in San Diego, CA and  proved to be successful.  The
              content of FCRC will be enriched by  five plenary sessions featuring
              internationally distinguished,  invited speakers.  ***
