Abstract    :
              9628199  Stixrude      The PIs propose to apply their newly developed quantum
              mechanical  techniques to investigate the physical properties of the 
              constituent minerals of the earth's mantle.  This new technique  allows the
              calculation of physical properties of minerals with  large unit cells at high
              pressure and temperature, which has up to  now been impossible.  These results
              will enable the PIs to provide  a firm theoretical basis for understanding the
              physics, chemistry  and mineralogy of the earth's mantle.  ***
