Abstract    :
              9628943  Adler  An important issue in ecology is to determine what limits
              densities of animal populations.  This problem is particularly acute in the
              tropics where there are few long-term experimental studies of population
              limitation.  Rodents are ideal organisms for testing hypotheses of density
              limitation because they are often abundant and easily sampled.  This study will
              test five theories of density limitation in the spiny rat Proechimys
              semispinosus, a common rodent in tropical forests in Central America.  This
              species is of particular interest because it is an important predator and
              disperser of tree seeds and may therefore influence forest regeneration. 
              Twelve islands in the Panama Canal will serve as experimental systems in which
              food abundance and rat densities will be altered.  Responses to the experiments
              will be monitored over a four-year period.  This study will advance our
              understanding of animal populations in tropical forests, and the results may be
              applicable to many other organisms.  Spiny rats are also important hosts for
              many infectious agents that cause diseases in humans, including leishmaniasis
              and Chagas' disease.  Better knowledge of host populations will aid in finding
              points in the transmission cycles of these pathogens that are most vulnerable
              to intervention and that decrease the risk of transmission to humans.
