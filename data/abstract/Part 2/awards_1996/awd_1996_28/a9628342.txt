Abstract    :
              9628342  Green  Preliminary observations and analyses have been made on the
              fresh garnet lherzolite of the Alpe Arami peridotite massif in southern
              Switzerland. The new data suggest a history involving much higher pressure than
              the 4-5 GPa calculated from pyroxene thermobarometry. The older generation of
              olivine has large numbers of oriented oxide inclusions that are almost
              certainly products of exsolution. The difficulty is that the implied solubility
              of trivalent and tetravalent cations is very much greater than previously
              reported for olivine from any environment. Preliminary experiments at 6 and 14
              GPa, 1700(K, confirm that the solubility of TiO2 in olivine increases greatly
              with pressure, and that it is significantly higher still in the high pressure
              polymorph of olivine. This project consists of a series of experiments at very
              high temperature and pressure to delineate under what conditions, if any,
              olivine can dissolve the observed amounts of Ti, Al and Cr, and under what
              conditions the observed structures, morphologies and topotaxies can be
              precipitated from solid solution.  Three specific testable hypotheses will be
              examined. (1) The FeTiO3 rods originated by exsolution. (2) Their abundance
              probably represents more TiO2 than can dissolve in olivine under any
              circumstances, hence they may reflect some pre-existing phase. (3) If
              exsolution takes place in the ilmenite stability field, ilmenite would have
              precipitated directly as platelets and the (presumable) metastable oxide rods
              would not have formed at all.
