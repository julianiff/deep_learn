Abstract    :
              9628507  Verosub    The PIs propose to examine the acquisition of thermoviscous 
              remanent magnetization on geologically significant time scales by  studying
              randomly-oriented cobbles and boulders that have been  exposed to earth's
              magnetic field for known intervals of time.   Thermal demagnetization will be
              used to determine the unblocking  temperatures of the secondary magnetization
              components which have  developed in these rocks and will be complemented by
              detailed  mineral magnetic investigations designed to characterize the 
              mineralogy, grain size and domain state of the magnetic carriers.   This work
              will provide important insight into the relationship  between a time and
              temperature in the acquisition of thermoviscous  remanent magnetization.   ***
