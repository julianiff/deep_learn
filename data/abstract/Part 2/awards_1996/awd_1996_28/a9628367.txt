Abstract    :
              Suttner  9628367   The goal of the proposed work is to quantitatively
              reconstruct paleochannel geometries and hydraulics, and associated alluvial
              architecture for early Cretaceous fluvial deposits in the Central Cordilleran
              Foreland Basin (CCFB).  Previous work has shown that the location and flow
              patterns of the major early Cretaceous rivers in the medial and distal parts of
              the CCFB were controlled, in part, locally by syndepositional intra-basinal
              faulting.  This study will elucidate precisely how this faulting influenced
              channel geometries (e.g. widths, depths, sinuosities, channel patterns),
              hydraulics (e.g. channel slopes, velocities, discharges), and the distribution
              of associated channel-bar, channel-belt, and floodplain deposits.  These
              parameters will be compared and contrasted in (i) medial and distal setting
              within the CCFB, (ii) in places where the rivers were located essentially on or
              adjacent to known structures versus places where the structures were several
              kilometers away, and (iii) where the rivers locally crossed the structures
              versus where they paralleled them.  Results of this study should be valuable
              for those who attempt to model how intra-basinal tectonism is manifested n the
              accumulation of nonmarine fill in the medial and distal parts of foreland
              basins.  Moreover, this work will be the first of its kind to document
              quantitatively the effects of localized syndepositional faulting on
              pre-Quaternary fluvial sedimentation.
