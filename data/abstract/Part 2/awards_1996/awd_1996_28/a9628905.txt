Abstract    :
                This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of metabolic
              biochemistry.  It addresses the important  question:  how do chloroplasts in
              the cytoplasm of plant  cells communicate with the nucleus?  The proper
              development  of plant cells relies upon this communication.  The  mechanisms
              for this communication are unclear even after  many years of investigation and
              progress.  There is evidence  that signals are relayed by the chloroplast and
              received by  the nucleus thus regulating specific genes.  The project  focuses
              on the identity of these signals.
