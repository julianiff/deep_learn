Abstract    :
              9628682  Olsen                            This research involves the calculation
              of three-dimensional  strong motion from large earthquakes applied to southern
              California  situations.  Intensive computational requirements earlier in this 
              work have led to the development of algorithms that run on  massively parallel
              computers.  A 3-D 4th order staggered-grid  finite-difference method was used
              to simulate wave propagation in  a model of the Los Angeles basin including the
              3-D structures of  the Los Angeles and San Fernando basins.  The results showed
              that  even moderate earthquakes outside the basins can cause damaging  motions
              within the basin due to basin effects.  This project will  further earlier work
              by comparing the 1992 M=7.3 Landers earthquake  simulations with actual data,
              calculating the effect of varying  rupture complexity of the earthquakes, and
              calculating the effects  of topographic scattering.  This research is a
              component of the  National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
