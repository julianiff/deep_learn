Abstract    :
              9628042  Wentzcovitch        The PIs propose to apply their newly developed
              quantum mechanical  techniques to investigate the physical properties of the 
              constituent minerals of the earth's mantle.  This new technique  allows the
              calculation of physical properties of minerals with  large unit cells at high
              pressure and temperature, which has up to  now been impossible.  These results
              will enable the PIs to provide  a firm theoretical basis for understanding the
              physics, chemistry  and mineralogy of the earth's mantle.  ***
