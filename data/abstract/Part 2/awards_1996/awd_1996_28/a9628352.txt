Abstract    :
              9628352  Fisher   The kinematic history of collisions between island arcs and
              continental margins is of considerable importance in attempts to interpret
              ancient deformation.   Taiwan is an active obliquely colliding island arc onto
              the asian margin, and therefore offers a spatial analog for the sequence of
              kinematic responses developed during a collisional episode.   This project will
              study a series of transects from  north to south across the retrowedge of  
              Taiwan that represents late and early stages respectively, kinematic indicators
              and fabrics will be studied and results incorporated in testing a number of
              theoretical models for wedge mechanics, kinematics and thermal structures that
              have been proposed for Taiwan.   Results are expected to be applicable to other
              oblique orogenic belts.
