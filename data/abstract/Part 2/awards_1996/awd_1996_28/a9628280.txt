Abstract    :
              9628280   Miller   The tectonic setting of the Cascades Core remains
              controversial, particularly the manner in which the high grade rocks were
              loaded during te development of the Cretaceous arc and the associated magmatic
              events. Several models of magmatic processes in the deep crust of continental
              arcs have been advanced, but the lack of deep crustal exposures have provided
              only limited constraints for the applicability of these models. This project
              will focus on the structural, metamorphic, plutonic and geochemical processes
              operating in the Ten Peak pluton, which is the deepest exposed pluton of
              significant size in the Cascades Core. Results are expected to clarify the role
              of mafic magmas in generating the pluton, to provide insights into deep crustal
              emplacement mechanisms and to allow a better understanding of the evolution and
              loading history of the Cascade arc.
