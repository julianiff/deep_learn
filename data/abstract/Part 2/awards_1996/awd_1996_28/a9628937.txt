Abstract    :
              9628937  Harrison  Theoretical models predict that interspecific interactions,
              combined with limited dispersal, may sometimes produce stable spatial patterns
              in population densities.  This study focuses on a herbivorous insects that
              tends to form dense, but very localized, populations within larger areas of its
              host plant.  Previous work has established that this insects, the western
              tussock moth, is a very poor disperser, and that its spatial distribution does
              not appear to be explained by variable habitat quality.  The present study
              examines two non-exclusive ways that the observed pattern could arise from
              interactions between the moth and its natural enemies:  (1)  Predator
              satiation, in which a poorly mobile, generalist predator (an ant) inflicts
              higher mortality on prey where prey are dense than where they are sparse, and
              (2)  Predator diffusion, in which mobile, specialized natural enemies (two
              parasitoids) "spill over" around the edges of dense prey populations, creating
              surrounding zones in which predator-prey ratios, and therefore mortality, are
              elevated.  Preliminary field results indicate both these mechanisms may be
              operating, but not whether they are strong enough to suppress the spread of
              outbreaks.  This study uses field experiments combined with simulation and
              analytic modeling to test these explanations for spatial population patterns.  
               Understanding the factors that govern population densities remains a central
              issue in ecology.  In particular, discerning the causes of epidemic densities
              of pest species, should greatly enhance the ability to control future outbreaks
              and thus lessen the ecological and economic damage from such events.
