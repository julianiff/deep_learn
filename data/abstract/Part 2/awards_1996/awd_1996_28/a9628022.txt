Abstract    :
              This research explores the application of fuzzy logic methodology to logic and 
              architectural synthesis.  Constructive and iterative design strategies as well 
              as adaptive capabilities are being introduced in design algorithms. 
              Theoretical  aspects of adaptation of design algorithms are being investigated.
               Methodologies  and tools being developed include: 1. Multi-objective iterative
              algorithms for  physical design; 2. Adaptive placers; 3. A system for logic
              synthesis and list  scheduling; 4. Technology mappers for FPGAs. These are
              being implemented in  software and tested on variety of benchmarks.
