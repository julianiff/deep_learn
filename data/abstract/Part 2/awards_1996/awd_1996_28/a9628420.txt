Abstract    :
              9628420  Spanos    The next generation of integrated electronics call for the
              stable  manufacture of 0.2 micron linewidth circuits.  It is widely  recognized
              that photolithography will play a vital role in  realizing this objective, both
              through new process technologies  and through modeling, metrology, and
              integrated control.   This research proposal is motivated by the recognition
              that  intelligent process control will play an enabling role in the 
              development of reliable high-performance pattern transfer  technology.    The
              broad objectives of our proposed research are to develop,  implement, and test
              integrated process control methods for  various lithographic processes.   To
              accomplish our research objectives, we anticipate using  existing sensors,
              designing some new metrology schemes,  developing control-oriented process and
              equipment models, and  developing control and diagnostics strategies that
              integrate  across the various processing steps involved.  ***
