Abstract    :
              9628380  Miller       The response of the continental crust to extension is 
              complex and incompletely understood, as is the role that  magmatisms plays. 
              This project will examine the response to  extension in the Eldorado Mountain
              area of the Colorado  River extensional Corridor where a strong depth gradient
              is  exposed.  to the north, extension is accommodated by  primarily brittle
              features while to the south, large-scale  normal faults bring deeper-level
              rocks to the surface.  Mapping and structural analysis of the plutons and 
              structural features, supported by geochronologic geochemical  and paleomagnetic
              studies, will establish the composition  and three-dimensional partitioning of
              strain in the thick  crustal section.  Results should provide important
              insights  into several fundamental problems including mechanism of  crustal
              extension, how continental crust is modified by  extension and the role of
              magmatism in extending terranes.
