Abstract    :
              9628065  Renne  The proposed research will provide fundamental data toward
              clarifying the spatial-temporal evolution of flood volcanism in the
              Parana-Etendeka province (PEP) of southwestern Africa and eastern South
              America.  The PEP is one of the largest continental flood volcanic provinces
              known, and data acquired herein will be relevant to broader questions about the
              origin of flood volcanism.  Relations between volcanism, the Tristan da Cunha
              hotspot, and Early Cretaceous rifting of the South Atlantic will be elucidated
              by high-precision geochronologic and paleomagnetic and rock magnetic work that
              will be done in connection with ongoing stratigraphic and petrologic studies. 
              New and detailed magnetostratigraphy will be established for volcanic sections
              in the Etendeka Province of Namibia as well as the Parana Province of Uruguay. 
              Refined and well-dated apparent polar wander paths (APWP's) will be derived for
              both South America and southern Africa over the interval of     135-120 Ma; the
              APWP's will quantify rotation due to asymmetric opening of the South Atlantic
              and will be used to refine the trace of the Tristan hotspot.  40Ar/39Ar  and
              U/Pb dating will be used to constrain with greater certainty any migratory
              trends in volcanism.  Correlations between individual flows across the Atlantic
              will be tested paleomagnetically and rock-magnetically; a corollary of such
              correlation will be a high-precision basis for pre-drift reconstruction of
              western Gondwanaland.  Determination of volcanic flow directions (constraining
              locations of sources) will be attempted using anisotropy of magnetic
              susceptibility (AMS) from widely separated flow sequences, particularly units
              being tested for Transatlantic correlation.
