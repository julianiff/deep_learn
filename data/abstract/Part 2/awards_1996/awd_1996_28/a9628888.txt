Abstract    :
                              9628888  Hood        This is a four year Faculty Early Career
              Development (CAREER)  award which includes both a basic science and a course
              development  component.  The research will develop and apply a generalized 
              Lagrangian particle trajectory model for the Chesapeake Bay which  will then be
              used to develop an individual based, coupled biologic  al and physical model of
              the sea nettle.   This research will have  two principle goals: The first is to
              provide a general particle  trajectory model for the Chesapeake Bay research
              community that can  be used as a tool for physical, chemical and biological
              research in  the Bay. The second is to use the model to study how the interacti
               on between physical and biological processes determines the time  and space
              distributions of and the impact the sea nettle has upon  its prey in the
              Chesapeake Bay. The 3-dimensional, time-dependent  flow will be provided by a
              hydrodynamic circulation model which was  developed as part of the Chesapeake
              Bay Program. Gelatinous zoopla  nkton data from the NSF LMER-TIES field
              observational program will  be used for model formulation,  initialization and
              groundtruthing.       The project meets the NSF's CAREER program objectives
              because it w  ill allow Dr. Hood to broaden his current ecosystem modeling 
              research into the realm of individual based and Lagrangian particle  trajectory
              modeling and develop a research program that focuses on  the Chesapeake Bay.
              The latter will foster interaction with scient  ists involved in the Chesapeake
              Bay Program and LMER-TIES. The  project will also allow the principle
              investigator to develop a  course in his general area of specialization. This
              course is needed  because it will provide the basic training that biologists
              need to  carry out coupled biological and physical modeling research and it  is
              unique because the research will form the basis for instruction.  It is hoped
              that this training will ultimately facilitate  interaction between biological
              and physical scient ists and foster  more interdisciplinary research on
              biological and physical  interactions in marine systems.
