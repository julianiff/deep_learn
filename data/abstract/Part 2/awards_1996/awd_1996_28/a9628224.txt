Abstract    :
              9628224  Frisch  This grant aims at the preparation of novel interpenetrating 
              polymer networks (IPN's) including hybrid porous inorganic  material containing
              ones (whose pores contain polymer chains  of unusual properties) as well as
              full and pseudo (or semi)  IPN's functionalized with non-linear optical (NLO) 
              chromophores.  The latter IPN materials offer great promise  for long lived
              second harmonic generating films.  Other  K3C60 containing blends of linear
              polymers are  superconducting and will be further investigated.  In 
              collaboration with a number of other investigator groups,  these new materials
              will be studied using SAXS with  synchrotron radiation, dielectric and
              ultrasonic  measurements as well as the more usual electron microscopy, 
              differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and mechanical  property measurements. 
              The ultimate use of these materials  depends on whether they have undergone a
              phase transition,  e.g. IPN's are often microphase separated (particularly if 
              mechanically stressed), or whether they exhibit a triphasic  collapse in the
              ease of IPN gels.  Further polymer ordering  transitions such as the microphase
              separation transition in  diblock copolymers confined between walls and the
              nematic  and discoidal ordering with hard disc molecules will be  studied using
              exact models.  %%%  This project falls into the general area of synthesis, and 
              properties of polymer blends and networks.  Besides  contributing to the
              preparation of novel materials with  special uses such as toughened membranes,
              NLO devices,  separation membranes, and new catalyst supports, the  proposed
              work should help elucidate some interesting  features of polymer phase
              transitions.  ***
