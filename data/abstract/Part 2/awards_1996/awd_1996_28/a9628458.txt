Abstract    :
              9628458  Gross                            This research involves the estimation
              of regional stress rates in  seismically active areas by means of application
              of the rate and  state-dependent friction model of Dieterich to the location
              and  timing of aftershocks following a major earthquake.  The technique  was
              applied to the 1992 M=7.6 Landers, California, earthquake to  derive a 122
              Pa/day stress rate.  The estimation of stress rates is  important because there
              is no method of directly measuring this  quantity, which is important for
              seismic hazard estimation.  The  overall conclusion that the Dieterich relation
              makes successful  predictions about the spatial and temporal signature of
              aftershock  generation and decay suggests that time dependent friction is 
              applicable to active faults.  Application of the method to the  Northridge
              aftershocks may provide a new constraint on the rate of  stress accumulation in
              the Los Angeles basin.  This research is a  component of the National
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
