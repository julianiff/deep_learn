Abstract    :
              HRD-9628475  Ackerman    Long Island University's Brooklyn Campus requests
              support for the  acquisition of a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer with
              a  superconducting magnet, operating at 300 MHz.  The University will  provide
              non-Federal matching funds on a one-to-one basis.    The University is a
              private institution and its Brooklyn Campus has  an enrollment of 8,000
              students, more than 50% of whom are  minorities underrepresented in the
              sciences.  This proposal is made  on behalf of the department of chemistry,
              which experiences  approximately 900 undergraduate and 70 graduate (master's
              level)   registrations per semester.  There are 41 undergraduate chemistry 
              majors:  14 are Black and 3 are Hispanic; 27 are women and 14 are  men.  The
              Molecular Biology undergraduate program (co-sponsored by  the chemistry and
              biology departments) has 20 undergraduate majors:   7 are Black and 2 are
              Hispanic; 12 are women.  The master's program  in chemistry has 16 majors: 7
              are Black, 2 are Hispanic, and 12 are  women.    The acquisition of the NMR
              spectrometer will fill a major gap in   the otherwise adequate research and
              instructional equipment of the  department.  It will strengthen the research
              environment of the  institution and will enhance very significantly the
              research  capabilities of five faculty, will have beneficial impact on the  
              capabilities of two more, and will bring about a significant  improvement il
              the laboratory training of those students majoring  in chemistry.    The
              proposed research to be performed on the instrument includes   classical
              organic syntheses, the development of new catalysts for  organic compound
              transformations and polymerizations, the  development of new materials with
              interesting electrical  properties, the better understanding of properties and 
              thermodynamics of unsaturated molecules, and the better fundamental 
              understanding and modeling of industrial resin manufacture.  These  projects
              are for the immediate future and it is expected that the  equipment wi ll
              remain in service for the next 10-15 years,  maintained by the University, will
              support many more research  undertakings, and will increase significantly the
              contribution of  this institution to the Nation's scientific research
              activities.
