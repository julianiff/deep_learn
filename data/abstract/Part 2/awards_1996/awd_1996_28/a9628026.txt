Abstract    :
              Li, Gang  SUNY-Buffalo  This proposal deals with a soil erosion model and
              specifically within such a model the sediment transport capacity of overland
              flow.  The ability of future models to predict soil erosion depends upon the
              predictive accuracy of erosion and deposition which in turn is contingent upon
              the development of a reliable transport capacity equation for overland flow on
              rough surfaces.  The proposed research will develop such an equation for
              laminar interrill overland flow.  A secondary goal is the investigation of the
              effect of suspended and saltating sediment on the velocity profile and flow
              resistance.  These goals will be pursued by performing flume experiments using
              differing roughness elements and simulated rainfall at differing intensities. 
              In a second set of experiments, a hot-film anemometer will be used to measure
              velocity profiles and flow resistance will be calculated from the profiles. 
              The effect of sediment transport on shallow laminar flows has not been
              investigated previously.  The determination of the effects has important
              implications for our further understanding of the hydraulics of laminar
              overland flow.  Statistical analyses, especially mutiple regression, will be
              used to develop the necessary predictive equations.
