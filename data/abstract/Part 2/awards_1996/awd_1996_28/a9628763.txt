Abstract    :
              9628763  Allen  A workshop will be convened to improve the scientific basis of
              ecological restoration. The field of restoration biology is growing rapidly and
              is in need of a stronger conceptual basis. Restoration may be considered an
              experimental tool for understanding functioning of ecological systems, but the
              promise of the contribution restoration ecology can make has not been
              fulfilled. There are literally thousands of restoration projects throughout the
              country, with many opportunities for restoration research on already-prepared
              sites. However, the number of these projects in which researchers collaborate
              remains relatively small. The goals of the workshop are to encourage more
              scientists to write high quality proposals, enhance the conceptual basis of
              restoration research, and develop linkages between scientists and
              practitioners. A major theme is changing the emphasis in restoration from an
              anecdotal to a scientific approach. A two-day workshop will be organized
              hierarchically to discuss organismal, community, ecosystem, and landscape level
              issues relevant o restoration. The workshop will determine if there are
              conceptual challenges to restoration that are unique to restoration biology. A
              special area of emphasis will be building partnerships between practitioners
              and theorists to improve the practice and research in restoration biology.   
              The topic of this workshop is timely and important. The products of the
              workshop will be a report to NSF regarding mechanisms to increase and improve
              the quality of restoration oriented proposals, and a set of published paper to
              expand upon the themes discussed at the workshop.
