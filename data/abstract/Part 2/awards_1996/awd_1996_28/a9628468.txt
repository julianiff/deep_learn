Abstract    :
              This is a career advancement award to apply theoretical methods from the study 
              of interconnection networks to the study of all-optical broadcast networks. 
              The  goal of the research is to develop new scheduling algorithms to improve
              the  performance of broadcast networks that use wavelength division
              multiplexing.  The  scheduling algorithms will take into account an arbitrary
              set of system  parameters that change with technology.  The research will
              provide insight into  the user of multiple wavelengths and tunable devices in
              optical networks.
