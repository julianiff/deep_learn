Abstract    :
              9628381  Tikoff   Major orogenic belts occur at zones of interaction between
              rigid plates or blocks which converse or diverge obliquely relative to one
              another.   At zones of oblique convergence, material accommodates both 
              shortening across the belt and lateral shearing parallel to the belt.   In the
              upper crust this deformation is not accommodated homogeneously, with
              contraction structures having shortening directions perpendicular to the orogen
              coexisting with strike-slip faults oriented parallel to the belt.   This
              phenomena of strike-slip partitioning occurs at subduction and continental
              collision zones on a variety of scales, but as yet does not have a clear
              mechanical explanation.  The objective of this project is to test the
              hypothesis that strike-slip partitioning is inherently related to the
              nonplane-strain character of deformation in oblique tectonics.   By combining
              kinematic modeling with a series of physical and numerical experiments, the
              dynamics of strike-slip partitioning will be investigated.  Results are
              expected to improve the understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of
              strike-slip partitioning in the upper crust.
