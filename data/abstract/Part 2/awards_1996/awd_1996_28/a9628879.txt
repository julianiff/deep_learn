Abstract    :
              9628879  Morgan      The PIs propose to test core-mantle exchange in the Earth
              using the  Pt-Os isotope system to study rocks which are believed to have been 
              brought to the Earth's surface in mantle-derived plumes.  If  succesful, 1860s
              anomalies in plume-derived materials may provide  the only direct test of
              core-mantle interaction.  The proposed  study of Os and Pt isotopic systematics
              will be made on an array of  mantle-derived rocks as well as on mantle and
              crustal rocks that  may be recycled into the mantle, to determine if excess Os
              in  plume-derived materials can be used as a test of core-mantle  interaction.
