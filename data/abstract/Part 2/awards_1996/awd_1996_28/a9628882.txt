Abstract    :
              The PI will study the scaling symmetry of spatial and temporal structure of
              solar magnetic and velocity fields to trace their physical origins in the
              convective solar plasma.  First, she will investigate the range of physical
              scales and magnetic filed strengths over which multifractal symmetry applies on
              the Sun.  Wavelet transforms will localize image sites where the magnetic field
              strength appears to show singular behavior.  The PI will observe the relation
              between these sites and unresolved magnetic structures, such as flux-tubes. 
              She will then distinguish between zero or transverse field configurations
              versus rapidly reversing fields using the scaling symmetry of fluctuations in
              the direction of the magnetic vector field.  By examining Doppler images, the
              PI will determine the form of scaling and, thus, of the transport in the
              photosphere.  Finally, the PI will examine a diverse array of effective models
              for the generation of observed magnetic field structuring and scaling symmetry.
