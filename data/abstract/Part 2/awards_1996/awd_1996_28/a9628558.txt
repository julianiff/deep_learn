Abstract    :
              MARTIN  DMS-9628558  The Department of Mathematics at Texas Tech University will
               purchase computer equipment that will be dedicated to the  support of research
              in the mathematical sciences.  The  equipment will be used for several projects
              including in  particular:  Computational Issues in Biomechanics,  Computational
              Problems in Complex Analysis and Applications,  Numerical Methods for Vlasov
              Kinetic Equations and  Computational Issues in the Enzyme Activity in Cotton 
              Seedlings.  The four projects listed are computationally and  graphics
              intensive and the equipment requested is essential  for the success of these
              four projects.  The four projects  cover a wide range of pure and applied
              mathematics ranging  from complex analysis to an application from agriculture,
              to  a problem of determining the stress in the tibia during  exercise and to a
              classical problem in transport theory.   The common thread that connects these
              problems is the need  for accurate, fast computation and the ability to
              visualize  the results with detailed graphics.
