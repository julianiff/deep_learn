Abstract    :
              ***   9628595  Andrew G. Bruce      This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase II project has the ultimate objective of developing an object-oriented
              software toolkit for wavelet based nonparametric prediction.  The current
              theory and practice of nonparametric estimation with wavelets is limited to a
              small set of prediction problems.  Statistical prediction or function
              estimation is of fundamental importance, with applications to a broad range of
              problems.  In the overwhelming majority of situations, non-parametric
              prediction methods are the most appropriate.  Based on the wavelet transform,
              Donoho and Johnstone have developed a powerful methodology, called
              "WaveShrink", for nonparametric function estimation.  WaveShrink has  a  very
              broad asymptotic near-optimality property and has proven valuable in practice.
              The project will address itself to fundamental advancements that are needed to
              develop new wavelet methodology encompassing a much broader set of prediction
              problems.  The new and existing methodology will be collected into a coherent
              object-oriented software toolkit.  This toolkit will be of use to a broad range
              of statisticians, data analysts, scientists, and engineers.    The research
              will lead to a completely new version of the S-Plus software module S+Wavelets.
               Other commercial opportunities include consulting and teaching, a Mathcad
              function pack and electronic book, software licensing and patenting innovative
              algorithms.  ***
