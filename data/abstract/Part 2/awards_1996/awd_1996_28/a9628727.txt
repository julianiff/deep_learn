Abstract    :
              Wang, Jinkang  U. of Southern California   The presence or absence of beach
              cusps in a coastal environment may be considered as one diagnostic of the
              nearshore morphodynamic regime.  This project will explore mechanisms of beach
              cusp formation on gravel beaches through the empirical evaluation of competing
              hypotheses.  These are the standing edge-wave model and the system self
              organization model.  For more than 20 years most coastal scientists have
              accepted the edge-wave theory.  Recent analyses suggest that self organization
              may provide a better explanation.  The research is designed to obtain the data
              necessary to discriminate between the two mechanisms.  Field investigation will
              be carried out at Malin Head, Ireland, where cusps are common and active along
              a stretch of gravel shoreline, and condition favor a resolution of this
              conflict.  Evaluations will require measurement and comparison of oscillatory
              currents and water surface fluctuations at several points adjacent to the
              foreshore, repetitive grid profiling, sediment sampling and measurement of
              swamp uprush.  Through these efforts the controversy over the origins of beach
              cusps can be resolved.  The research will expand our knowledge of several
              prominent beach morphology mechanisms.
