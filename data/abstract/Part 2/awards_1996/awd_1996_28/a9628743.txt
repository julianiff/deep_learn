Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to examine the role of nutrient levels in
              determining the distribution and abundance of salt marsh plants species. 
              Preliminary experiments indicate that nutrient levels influence the competitive
              ability of marsh plants by changing the focus of competition from belowground
              to aboveground.  This suggests that differences in marsh vegetation patterns
              are the result of tradeoffs between above and belowground competition as
              nutrient levels change.  The investigators will experimentally investigate the
              mechanisms responsible for the linkage between nutrients and competitive
              ability and the relationship between nutrient supplies and marsh vegetation
              patterns.    The variables that contribute to the distribution patterns of
              species along environmental gradients are of interest to resource managers. 
              Results from this study will provide an important tool in helping ecologists
              predict the consequences of anthropogenic nutrient additions on native plant
              communities.
