Abstract    :
              9628368  Hornberger    In many catchment-stream systems, the concentration and
              composition of dissolved organic material (DOM) is a critical water quality
              characteristic.  Examples of processes controlled by DOM interactions are:  1)
              complexation of trace metals by the humic fractions of DOM which control both
              trace metal transport and bioavailibility;  2) enhancement of the solubility of
              hydrophobic organic contaminants;  3) formation of trihalomethanes in drinking
              water as a result of interactions between  Chlorine and components of the DOM
              during water treatment;  and 4) absorption of visible and UV radiation by DOM
              and generation of photoproducts.  The DOM also can have indirect effects on
              water quality by influencing internal processes of aquatic ecosystems, e.g.,
              photosynthesis and heterotrophic activity.    In this proposal, we advance a
              plan of study to investigate in-stream processes and their interaction with
              catchment processes in determining the spatial and temporal patterns of
              quantity and quality of DOC in streams in the Rocky Mountains.  The research 
              tasks will include experimental additions of DOC-enriched water to stream
              segments to quantify interactions in the hyporheic zone,  field  monitoring  to
              deermine synoptic spatial patterns along stream channels and in hillslope 
              lysimeters of amounts and composition of DOC, and the extension of mathematical
              models to interpret the results.  Studies of the in-stream processes will
              include continuing assessment of the roles of near-stream and catchment-scale
              processes.
