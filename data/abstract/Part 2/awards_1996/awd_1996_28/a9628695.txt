Abstract    :
                9628695 Rozgonyi  This research project is a collaborative effort between
              researchers at NCSU and Oak Ridge National Labs(ORNL) to study fundamental
              mechanisms and phenomena associated with radiation-produced defects in silicon,
              and the complex interactions that control defect formation, diffusion and
              annihilation.  The project will investigate the effects of in situ changes to
              the electronic state of semiconductors by photoexcitation and/or internal
              electric fields on damage accumulation processes. In situ measurement of
              specific defect levels in ion implanted silicon will be made by deep level
              transient spectroscopy(DLTS).  Ion flux and temperature variations, as well as
              in situ photoexcitation during implantation coupled with in situ DLTS
              measurements will be used to elucidate specific mechanisms of defect formation
              and reaction in silicon with extension of these studies to GaAs, GaN, and SiC
              anticipated.   %%% The research will contribute basic materials science
              knowledge at a fundamental level of technological relevance to advanced
              electronic materials processing.  Additionally, the knowledge and understanding
              gained from this research project is expected to contribute in a general way to
              improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a
              fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and processing advanced
              materials and devices.  An important feature of the program is the integration
              of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally
              and technologically significant area. ***
