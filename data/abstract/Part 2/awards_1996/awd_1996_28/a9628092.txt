Abstract    :
              9628092  Hauri  This project will begin a new generation of trace element
              partitioning experiments at the high pressures and temperatures applicable to
              magmatic conditions throughout the Earth's upper mantle and transition zone to
              the top of the lower mantle. The results will have important implications for
              the ancient and continuing differentiation of planetary interiors by partial
              melting and crystal fractionation. Synthesis experiments, including
              long-duration, time-series, and reversal experiments will be performed on the
              multi-anvil presses at the Geophysical Laboratory and at SUNY Stony Brook. The
              starting material will consist of a combination of natural rocks ranging from
              basalt to peridotite, with trace elements doped at 1000 ppm level where
              necessary. The trace element partition coefficients will be analyzed by ion
              probe at Woods Hole and the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism. Many elements
              will be examined simultaneously in individual experiments, focusing on about 20
              key elements which are well determined in natural rocks (transition metals,
              REE, high-field-strength elements, alkalis and alkali-earth elements), provide
              potentially stringent tests of intramantle differentiation (e.g.
              pseudo-constant ratios Ce/Pb, Nb/U, Ba/Rb, K/U, etc.) and provide crucial links
              to the long-lived radioactive isotope systems (Rb/Sr, Sm/Nd, Lu/Hf, U/Pb,
              Th/Pb).
