Abstract    :
              9628080  Cole    This grant provides $113,487 as one-half support  of the costs
              of acquiring a stable isotope ratio  mass spectrometer (SIRMS) with a dual
              inlet system  and a Kiel device for automated carbonate sample  introduction. 
              The PI's research involves  deciphering high resolution records of climate 
              change indicated by variations in the carbon and  oxygen isotopic signatures
              recorded in biogenic  carbonates including corals, foraminifera and  mollusc
              shells.  The primary focus of research to  be conducted utilizing this mass
              spectrometer will  be on analyses of the del 18-O recorded in  massive,
              scleractinian coral skeletons as high  resolution indicators of variability in
              tropical  sea surface temperatures.  These corals grow  rapidly and can live
              for periods as long as 800  years and thus offer a unique, high resolution 
              record of climate variability over decadal to  centurian time-scales and can
              aid our  understanding of coupled ocean-atmospheric systems  such as the El Ni
              o/Southern Oscillation that has  global significance in determining patterns of
               precipitation and thus is relevant to worldwide  agriculture and flooding
              hazard mitigation.  To  effectively and efficiently analyze the carbon and 
              oxygen isotopic ratios recorded in biogenic  carbonates at sub-monthly
              resolutions requires a  sensitive mass spectrometer capable of analyzing 
              samples in the 100-600 micro-gram size range with  high throughput.  Analyses
              of upwards of 10,000  samples per year including sufficient replicates  so as
              to ensure regional fidelity can be required  for century-scale records.  The
              inclusion of a  Kiel device in this acquisition will allow  unassisted and
              sequential sample introduction of  up to 74 samples, thus allowing for
              nighttime  operations which are essential for maintaining the  high throughput
              necessary for these high-  resolution studies.  ***
