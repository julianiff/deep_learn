Abstract    :
                This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of neurobiology. 
              The project is entitled The Isolation of  MASH1 Expressing Cells from
              Transgenic Mice.  The mammalian  achaete-scute homologous gene 1 (MASH1) is a
              neuron-specific  transcription factor that identifies neural precursors in 
              multiple lineages at early stages of development and, in  some cases, is
              required for development to proceed.  The  aims are to isolate, characterize,
              and compare MASH1  expressing precursors using MASH1/lacZ expressing transgenic
               mice.
