Abstract    :
              9528158  Simpson   Recent research has suggested that western South America has
              tectonic elements that are closely   related to proterozoic and lower paleozoic
              events in the Appalachian margin of Laurentia.  This project is   a structural
              and geochronological study of the Pampean Ranges Province of  Central
              Argentina, where   high grade metasedimentary rocks, migmatites and tonalities
              of unknown age are cut by steeply east-  dipping mylonite zones.  The Sierra
              Pampeanas are controversial because tectonic models place Laurentia   against
              the pre-Andean western margin of  South America during the same time that a
              (Brasiliano)   orogenic belt in the Sierra Pampeanas is thought to have
              developed.  At issue is the role of Paleozoic   events, particularly the
              Ordovician Famatinian Orogeny, which is believed to have involved the accretion
                of Laurentian rocks of the Pre-Cordillera and rocks of the Western Sierra
              Pampeanas against the eastern   Sierra Pampeanan along the  800 km-long Eastern
              Famatinian shear zone.  This work will determine the   ages of the high grade
              metamorphism and the age of subsequent mylonitization.  Thus allowing a test of
                the main hypotheses.  This information is key to constraining the pre-Andean
              tectonic development here,   and the possible relationship to events in the
              Appalachian margin of Laurentia.
