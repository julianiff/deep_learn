Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research  Fellowship for 1996.   
              This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of computational
              biology with studies in the area of animal  developmental biology.  The title
              of the research and  training plan is "Controlling errors in embryological 
              development."    It is believed that the concentrations of spatially 
              distributed chemicals cause the patterned differentiation of  cells by causing
              differential responses in the genome.  A  mathematical model of this hypothesis
              will be used to  evaluate the capacity of such a mechanism for suppression of 
              the thermal fluctuations inherent in any concentration, a  necessary condition
              for the precision of embryological  patterning.
