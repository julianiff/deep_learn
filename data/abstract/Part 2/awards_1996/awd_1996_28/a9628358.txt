Abstract    :
              96-28358    Crossley      The PI proposes to determine to what extent gravity
              observations  could provide important and direct determinations of 1) the
              density  jump at the inner core/outer core boundary (ICB), 2) the gravity 
              stability profile of the liquid core and 3) the ellipticity of the  core/mantle
              boundary (CMB).  Determinations of the relationship  between core gravity
              signals at the earth's surface and the  dynamics of the liquid core of the
              earth should help our  understanding of the earths geomagnetic dynamo and the
              related   issues of convection in the earth's core and mantle.  ***
