Abstract    :
              Webster, James W  U of Georgia   This proposal examines late quaternary climatic
              variation within the Maya Lowlands, Belize as evidenced by variations in
              speleothem deposition.  Currently available paleoclimatic records for the Maya
              Lowlands of Central America are inadequate because detailed paleoclimate proxy
              data are difficult to obtain in humid, tropical areas.  Speleothems are thought
              to be a source of high resolution paleoclimate data.  The aims of the research
              are to examine speleothems as a source of paleoclimate proxy data and construct
              a regional, high resolution proxy record of climatic variation for up to 2000
              years B.P.  In addition, an attempt will be made to establish whether climate
              variation may have contributed to the decline of the Mayan civilization.  Such
              results may allow prediction of future climate fluctuations for the region. 
              Speleothems from the study area will examined petrographically and by digital
              image analysis.  Spectral methods will then be used to analyze the observed
              record and compare it with existing climate data.  The research is significant
              because it is the first high-resolution record of paleoclimate for Central
              America.  The results will contribute to our understanding of the Maya collapse
              and add to the growing body of knowledge concerning speleothems in climate
              research.
