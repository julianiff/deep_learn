Abstract    :
              9628481  Craig  Noble gas systematics show that atmospheric gases are introduced
              into magma chambers of volcanoes by injection of gases originally dissolved in
              ocean water, and thus contaminate the deep mantle gases in the pristine magma. 
              A major question is whether this process is localized, regional, or global in
              extent, and whether both continental and oceanic hotspot volcanoes are affected
              in similar ways.  The PI proposes to investigate this problem by mass
              spectrometric analyses of noble gases extracted from olivine crystals in
              volcanic lavas.  Correlations with radiogenic isotopes will provide information
              as to the nature and extent of this process in the oceanic and continental
              volcanic environments.  Secondly, 3He provides a unique signature for mantle
              hotspots, and can be used to elucidate hotspot tracks across continental
              regions (e.g., the Ethiopian hotspot).  The PI has shown that the helium
              signature identifies the Yellowstone Park volcanic center as a mantle hotspot,
              akin to the Ethiopian hotspot and the oceanic hotspots.  The Yellowstone
              hotspot has been tracked back along the Snake River Plain south-south-west to
              the Idaho border by measuring 3He/3He ratios in olivine crystals in lavas along
              this track.  It is proposed to continue this study by collecting and analyzing
              olivine basalts from the western edge to the continental border, to determine
              if the Yellowstone hotspot originally intersected the North American continent
              at its far western edge.
