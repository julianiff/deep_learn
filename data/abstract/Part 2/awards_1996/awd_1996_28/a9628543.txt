Abstract    :
              9628543  Weiler    Dissertations Initiative for the Advancement of Limnology and
              Oceanography: DIALOG II    This award helps support a symposium (DIALOG II)
              sponsored by multiple agencies to promote and develop interdisciplinary,
              inter-institutional, and international communication and collaborations among
              young Ph.D. recipients in limnology and oceanography.  An opportune time to
              bridge disciplinary differences and promote interdisciplinary research is
              shortly after the completion of the Ph.D.  This symposium targets 40 young
              scientists within 1-3 years of completing their  Ph.D. degrees to participate
              in a week long meeting to present and discuss emerging trends and issues in
              aquatic sciences.  In addition, the meeting promotes communication between
              young scientists trained in freshwater and marine aquatic sciences.
