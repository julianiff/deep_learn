Abstract    :
              Billard    The proposal requests support for fifteen U.S-based individuals from
              academic and nonprofit institutions to participate in the International
              Biometric Conference to be held in   Amsterdam Netherlands on July 1-5, 1996. 
              This is the biennial meeting of the International Biometric Society.  About
              one-third of those supported will be those with an official capacity and
              two-thirds will be new researchers, especially those traditionally
              underrepresented groups such as women and minorities.  Availability of awards
              will be advertised in publications of the ASA, the IMS and the Biometric
              Society.  Awardees will be selected by an Awards Selection Committee.
