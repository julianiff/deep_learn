Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Office of Special Projects in support of the  
              research of Professor John Brennan at Rutgers University. The research   deals
              with the synthesis and characterization of molecules, clusters and   solids
              containing lanthanide-chalcogen bonds. A variety of new lanthanide  
              chalcogenolate compounds will be studied in order to determine the nature   of
              bonding between the hard, ionic lanthanide metal ions and the soft   covalent
              aryl and pyridyl- chalcogenolate  ligands. Lanthanide   chalcogenide clusters
              will be prepared to address how bonding and   physical properties of lanthanide
              materials depend on dimensionality. The   research will ultimately relate the
              structural, magnetic and electronic   properties of molecular lanthanide
              chalcogenolate complexes and clusters   to the properties of the corresponding
              solids formed by chemical vapor   deposition.  Lanthanide-doped materials are
              becoming increasingly important in fiber   optic and semiconductor
              applications. They also may find applications in   magnetic materials. This
              research will  develop new synthetic methodology   and help fill the need for
              new  lanthanide containing  complexes and   cluster dopants and precursors.
