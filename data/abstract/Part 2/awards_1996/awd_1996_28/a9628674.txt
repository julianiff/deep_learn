Abstract    :
              9628674  Nelson  This project is to refine models of chemical reactions during
              melt migration through the mantle sing an extension of chromatographic theory. 
              In addition to the chromatographic principles outlined by previous workers, we
              will include consideration of changing porosity, melt fraction and variable
              mineralogy as a function of extent and type of melt-mantle reaction.  To test
              the model predictions, we propose to obtain a unique data set from thick
              alkalic basalt sequences.  Initial implementation of this model suggests at
              lease three distinct chemical characteristics to search for its alkalic basalt
              sequences.   In published data, previously, these trends have been ascribed to
              mantle metasomatism and/or presence of trace mantle phases such as zircon or
              rutile.  Preliminary evaluation suggests that the chromatographic model may be
              an equally viable alternative hypothesis to explain certain alkalic basalt
              trends.  The need for a more definitive test of the model motivates an
              analytical program to obtain isotopic and trace element flow-by-flow
              characterization of selected alkalic basalt vents on Hawaiian and Canary
              Islands.
