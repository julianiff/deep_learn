Abstract    :
              KARNIADAKIS  DMS-9628601  The present proposal is a request by the Division of
              Applied  Mathematics of Brown University to NSF for the acquisition  of
              equipment in order to improve the network infrastructure  and modernize the
              general-use workstation laboratory at the  Center for Fluid Mechanics
              Turbulence and Computation.  This  upgrade of our current facilities is
              necessary for the  optimum use of local computing resources as well as those 
              available at the national NSF-sponsored centers.  The  acquisitions will
              particularly enhance the use of the  parallel computer (IBM SP2/24-nodes)
              installed last year at  the Center.  The Center provides computational support
              for the research  in several mathematical sciences projects.  These include:  
              parallel algorithms on spectral and spectral element  methods, high-resolution
              simulations of supersonic  combustion, modeling and simulations of dispersed
              two-phase  flows, low-dimensional dynamical systems modeling, and 
              mathematicals models for vision and image processing.  The  Center s facilities
              will also be used to support activities  of the new Program in Scientific
              Computing at Brown  University as well as by faculty from Clark Atlanta 
              University to support a collaboration on computational  mathematics sponsored
              by the Leadership Alliance Program.
