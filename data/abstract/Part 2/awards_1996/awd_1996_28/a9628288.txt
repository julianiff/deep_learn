Abstract    :
              9628288  Rubin  Geochemical correlations indicate Kilauea's summit lavas were
              derived from a heterogeneous source.  In contrast, lavas erupted during
              sustained rift zone eruptions show rapid and systematic temporal decreases in
              their incompatible trace element ratios (e.g., Ce/Yb) but little or no change
              in Pb, Sr, and Nd isotope ratios.  These short-term geochemical relationships
              may be caused by progressive depletion of a localized, relatively homogeneous
              mantle source.  Out hypotheses to explain these observations are :  (1) the
              overall compositional variability of Kilauea lavas results from melting a
              heterogeneous mantle source.  (2) The rapid trace element changes during
              sustained rift-zone eruptions are observed because the magmas for these
              eruptions bypassed the summit reservoir and avoided it buffering and/or
              contaminating effects; and (3) The timescale for melting and magma transport
              are short (1-2 ka).  To specifically examine the above hypotheses it is planned
              to determine the activities of the major isotopes of U, Th, and Ra in three
              different Kilauea sample suites.  High-precision mass spectrometry methods will
              be used to determine 238U, 234U, 232U, 230U, 228Ra , 226Ra, and Ba
              concentrations in these lavas.  Integrating the results of these measurements
              with other available geochemical data will allow us to evaluate:  (1) the
              relative importance of variations in the partial melting process versus
              heterogeneity in the mantle source region for creating the compositional
              diversity of Kilauea lava, and (2) the structure (geometry and size) of
              Kilauea's shallow magma plumbing system.
