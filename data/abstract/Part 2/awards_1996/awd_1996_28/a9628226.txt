Abstract    :
              9628226  Klein    This planning grant will conduct a feasibility study: (1) to 
              determine the possibility of using CLAS test and questionaire data  to assess
              the effects of the California SSI; and (2) to investigate  the applicability of
              this approach for evaluation of systemic  reform in other locations.  Upon
              completion of the study, a written  analysis will be submitted outlining the
              findings and offering  various options for follow-up.
