Abstract    :
              9628074  Kong   Recent studies have indicated that large changes occur in strain
              distribution or partitioning and strain accommodation during the evolution of a
              collisional event.   This project will attempt to model dynamic causes for
              major spatial and temporal changes in strain distribution and initiation of
              major  intracontinental faults in Asia during Indo-Asian collision.   In order
              to evaluate the role of various input factors, the work will use a newly
              developed finite element technique to simulate both  the evolution of major
              fault systems and related deformation within major continental blocks.  Faults
              will be sequentially introduced into the model according to their ages
              determined by recent geochronologic studies.  The resultant systematic
              restoration of both distributed deformation and discrete fault movement will
              allow a rigorous evaluation of dynamic causes for the changes in tectonic
              styles and strain distribution in Asia during the Indo-Asian collision.
