Abstract    :
              HRD - 9628634  Gutheil  MeHarry Medical College    The objective of this
              proposal is to expand research capabilities  and training opportunities in
              Biochemistry and Physiology, with an  emphasis on Molecular Biochemistry and
              Physiology, at Meharry  Medical College.  The proposal seeks to improve the
              research  infrastructure which supports a research and training program 
              focused on the molecular aspects of enzyme function and cellular 
              communication.  The specific aims of the proposal are:         1.   To further
              develop the opportunities within the            Department of Biochemistry for
              training in the discipline            of enzyme kinetics, Dr. Gutheil's
              research proposal will            focus on kinetic studies of the bacterial
              glutathione            dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase.         2.   To
              further develop the opportunities within the            Department of
              Biochemistry for training in the structure-            function studies of
              flavin monooxygenases, Dr. Atta-            Asafo-Adjei's research will focus
              on probing the            structure and function of rabbit liver
              flavin-containing            monooxygenase (FM05) by cassette and site-directed
                         mutagenesis.         3.   To further develop the opportunities
              within the            Department of Physiology for training in the discipline  
                       of cellular signaling, Dr. Motley's research will focus            on
              mechanisms of mitogen-activated protein kinase            activation in VSMC.  
               The Departments of Physiology and Biochemistry are currently in the  process
              of expanding their capabilities in the areas of Molecular  Biochemistry and
              Physiology.  The proposed research will provide  training opportunities for
              under represented minorities in the  disciplines encompassed by the proposed
              research and allow these  research areas within the institution to be further
              developed.   This objective will be met by providing some salary support for 
              each of the investigators, by providing support for two minorit y  graduate
              students for two years, and by providing some support for  materials and
              supplies for the proposed research projects.
