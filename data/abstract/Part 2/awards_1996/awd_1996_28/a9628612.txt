Abstract    :
                  The Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the  University of
              Iowa will purchase computer workstations and  network servers to augment its
              existing network for research in  applied and mathematical statistics.  The
              equipment will be used  for several research projects including:        (1) 
              Some Correlation Testing Problems for Spatial Data  (2)  Maximum Likelihood
              Estimation of Nonlinear Continuous-Time  Models  (3)  Inference for
              Semiparametric Models with Applications to  Analysis of Censored Data  (4) 
              Maximum-Likelihood Methods for a Generalized Class of  Multivariate Categorical
              Response Models  (5)  Graphical User Interfaces for Statistical Analysis and 
              Planning.        These projects all involve the development of fundamental 
              statistical methodology which has potential for immediate  applications to the
              problems of society.  Furthermore, all of the  projects involve highly
              computationally intensive methods and  require the ability to handle large
              amounts of data.  Several  also require high-resolution and dynamic graphics
              capabilities.
