Abstract    :
              Vote-by-mail (VBM) offers exciting new possibilities for expanding the effective
              size of the electorate and doing so at less cost to the taxpayer.  Local VBM
              experiments have cost far less than typical voting booth elections and turnout
              has risen substantially.  In January 1996, this procedure will used statewide
              for the first time to determine the replacement for Oregon Senator Robert
              Packwood.  This research will focus on public reactions to VBM and its
              potential to increase turnout in future elections.  A post-election poll of
              1200 Oregon voters will be conducted at the conclusion of the election.  This
              study will provide a critical test of structural theories on the underlying
              problems with voter turnout in America.  The project also has immediate
              practical application.  The state of Oregon will consider legislation to
              establish VBM as standard practice in future elections if public reactions and
              efficiency assessments of the January 1996 election are favorable.  * * *
