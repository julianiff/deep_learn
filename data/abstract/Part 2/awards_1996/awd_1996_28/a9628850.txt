Abstract    :
                  9628850  Robinson   This award provides support for Dr. Robinson's
              continuing research on the low frequency variability of the extratropical
              atmosphere and employs a mix of observational analyses, analyses of general
              circulation model output, and simple numerical models.  The principal
              investigator will focus on three tasks.  The first is the development and
              application of a generalized barotropic model to be used for diagnostic and
              process studies of low frequency variability, both observed and in general
              circulation models (GCMs).  This is a new undertaking by the PI and involves a
              new, creative approach that employs the PI's empirically derived formulation of
              the relationship between potential vorticity and the streamfunction.  The other
              two tasks represent continuations of previously supported work.  One is a
              series of diagnostic studies of the dynamics governing the zonal index in GCM
              output and in observations, and of the predictability of the zonal index.  The
              other major area involves analytical studies of the nonlinear behavior of the
              barotropic instability of zonally asymmetric basic states which is believed to
              contribute to the low frequency variability in the atmosphere.  All of these
              studies are important for advancing understanding of atmospheric dynamic
              processes that are critical to improved extended range prediction.  ***
