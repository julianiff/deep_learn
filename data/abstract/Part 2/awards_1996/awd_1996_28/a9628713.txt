Abstract    :
              Steinmann, Susanne H  Clark University   The doctoral dissertation research will
              examine how women's resource management practices affect and respond to
              ecological and socio-economic changes associated with pastoral sedentarization
              and agro-pastoral intensification on the semi-arid steppe of eastern Morocco. 
              In this region more intensive herding and farming practices help sustain a
              growing human population.  Fieldwork will involve primary ethnographic data
              collection in the town of Tendrara, a village of settled Beni Guil nomads.  A
              questionnaire survey of 150 recently settled pastoral women will illuminate how
              gendered patterns of resource management shape and respond to sedentarization. 
              The study will seek to learn how ecological and economic changes affect women's
              access to, control over, and knowledge about animal and natural resources.  A
              major objective is to investigate the ways in which gender-specific interests,
              activities and knowledge adjust to these changes and influence land use
              decisions.  Wealth ranking, resource mapping, life histories, and informal
              interviews of women will complement the quantitative data.  This work is
              critical for it provides knowledge, now lacking, of the interrelationships
              between land use change, gender, and environment.
