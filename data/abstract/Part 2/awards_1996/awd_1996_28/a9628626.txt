Abstract    :
              LEIMKUHLER  DMS-9628626  The Department of Mathematics at the University of
              Kansas  will purchase a multiprocessor and several workstations  dedicated to
              the support of research in the mathematical  sciences.  The equipment will be
              used for several research  projects in dynamical systems and numerical
              analysis, in  particular:  (1) Adaptive Geometric Integrators for  Molecular
              Simulations and Rigid Body Dynamics; (2) Methods  for Large Matrix Eigenvalue
              Computations; (3) Moving Mesh  Methods for Time-Dependent Partial Differential
              Equations in  Two and Three Dimensions; (4) Studies in Nonlinear Dynamics  and
              Chaos: and (5) Geometric Visualization and Biological  Time Series Analysis.
