Abstract    :
              9628018  Salant  Travel support is provided to allow a group of US  tribologists
              with expertise in tribological performance  prediction to attend a US - Nordic
              workshop on the  performance predictive design of tribological machine 
              elements.  The Nordic participants have special expertise in  machine element
              design.  The workshop will examine the  status of the field and the need for
              synergy between the two  areas of expertise.  It will also develop suggestions
              for  future research activities and research collaborations in  the topic area.
