Abstract    :
              This is a Research at Undergraduate Institution (RUI)  project. This project
              will investigate both the techniques  for combining optimizations in
              compilation  and the  potential benefit of applying combined optimizations. A 
              determination of when optimizations can be combined has not  been discovered.
              Likewise, a tool to automatically generate  an optimizer for these more
              powerful combined optimizations  has not been developed. The objectives of this
              ongoing  project are: investigate the properties of optimizations  that permit
              their combination, describe when two  optimizations may be combined, and
              propose a tool which  generates an optimizer for the newly combined
              optimizations.  A generalization of the description to combine chains of 
              optimizations will also be investigated.    This project will be used as a
              vehicle to introduce  undergraduate students to the research process and
              actively  involve students in the theoretical investigation, the 
              implementation, the experimentation, and the dissemination  of the results.
              Students will be encouraged to involve  themselves in all aspects of this
              project.  ***
