Abstract    :
              9628023  Hochella  The proposed research continues long-standing research
              committed to rethinking, and sometimes reformulating, perceptions of how
              mineral surfaces communicate with their geologic environment. The specific
              objectives are: (1) To show that sophisticated mineral surface investigations
              can be performed on natural mineral surfaces instead of only surfaces created
              by fracture. (2) To probe electronic structure of different sites on unreacted
              hematite, pyrite, and pyrrhotite surfaces at the atomic level. (3) To probe the
              electronic structure of reaction products on these surfaces at the atomic
              level. (4) To characterize complex surface reaction sequences, and to
              specifically define "reactive surface area" for a given reaction on a given
              mineral surface. (5) To incorporate newly identified fundamental reaction
              mechanisms and processes into kinetic models that describe macroscopic
              observables. The methods that will be employed include: experimental ultra-high
              vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, calculation of tunneling
              images and spectra at the ab initio level, ultra-violet and x-ray photoelectron
              spectroscopy, low energy electron diffraction, scanning force microscopy and
              standard wet chemistry techniques. The significance of the proposed research is
              in its ability to determine fundamental reaction parameters and mechanisms.
