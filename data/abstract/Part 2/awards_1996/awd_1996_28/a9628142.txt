Abstract    :
              9628142  Stolper  Oxygen isotope ratios can provide important constraint on the
              origins of chemical and isotopic heterogeneity in the mantle sources of
              basaltic lavas.  Conventional measurements of whole-rock specimens and glasses
              are typically significantly influenced by the effect of sample alteration and
              isotopic fractionation during magmatic processes.  The P.I.s propose to use
              laser fluorination techniques to undertake a comprehensive survey of oxygen
              isotope variations in phenocrysts (primarily olivine) from arc-related lavas. 
              Results thus far indicate that laser fluorination technique provides an
              accurate and precise means of analyzing 18O/16O ratios in olivine and other
              phenocrysts.  The work will involve a survey of arc-related lavas, emphasizing
              basaltic back-arc lavas that can provide information on the mantle "wedge"
              above subduction zones.
