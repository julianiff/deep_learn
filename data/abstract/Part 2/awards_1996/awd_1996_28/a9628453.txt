Abstract    :
              9628453  Sack      This grant provides $31,081 as one-half support of the costs
              of  upgrading Purdue University's Earth and Atmospheric Science  Department's
              current Cameca SX-50 electron microprobe (EMP) with  a new computer and
              software for both automated mechanical control  of the instrument and
              subsequent X-ray image analysis and a new  vacuum evaporator used for chemical
              preparation of samples to be  analyzed.  Specifically, the upgrade will include
              a Sun SPARC 20  workstation and Cameca's SX-pack software package which
              includes  both mechanical control software and software for X-ray image 
              analysis and interpretation.  The new computer equipment will  replace an
              antiquated PDP-11/53 minicomputer that was supplied  with the EMP when it was
              purchased with support from NSF in 1972.  Software support for the PDP-11
              computer is no longer available  through Cameca.  Their present vacuum carbon
              coater, also  purchased in 1972, experiences mechanical failures frequently and
               will also be replaced.  This upgrade will allow this lab to  continue their
              highly regarded research program in mineral  thermodynamics and crystallography
              using a vintage but clearly  still useful EMP as the analytical centerpiece for
              major  elemental analysis of geological samples.   The upgraded SX-50  will
              also serve a broader community of both institutional and  regional users.  ***
