Abstract    :
                This project involves a pilot study of gender differences in children's
              aggression in play settings in Fiji.  The investigators are anthropologists at
              Union College.  Using ethnographic methods of observation and intensive
              interviews, they will examine aspects of children's play such as the size of
              play groups and degree of elaboration of rules and roles, that have been found
              to differ between N. American boys and girls.  The research site is interesting
              because Fijian children of both sexes do not display the aggressive interaction
              styles that boys in Western societies exhibit.  The goal of this study is to
              test various methods of studying play to pave the way for a long-term study
              involving play in both school and neighborhood settings.  This research is
              important because it will advance our understanding of the relative roles of
              peer group interaction versus authority-figure interaction in learning social
              values.  The project also will increase the expertise of two young social
              scientists about the methodology of how to study children's socialization
              patterns as well as our general knowledge about this important region of the
              world.
