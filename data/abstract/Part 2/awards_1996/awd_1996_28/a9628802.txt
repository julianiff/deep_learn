Abstract    :
              9628802  Gharakhanian    This is a Career Advancement Award for Women Scientists
              and Engineers.  The project focuses on the selective recognition, sorting and
              transport of proteins to the lysosome (vacuole) of the yeast, Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae.  As in higher eukaryotes, the lysosomal vacuole of the yeast is its
              degradative organelle, and several hydrolytic enzymes are localized there via
              the secretory pathway.  Various mutant screening strategies in different
              laboratories have resulted in the isolation of a large collection of yeast
              mutants that exhibit severe defects in protein delivery to the vacuole, called
              vacuolar protein sorting mutants (vps mutants).  The defective genes in these
              mutants are likely to encode components of the cell's protein sorting
              apparatus.  Using a modified screening method, this laboratory isolated a new
              vps mutant, vps47, which represents a unique genetic defect:  it is the only
              severe temperature sensitive vps mutant to date that shows no defects in the
              integrity, structure, or function of the vacuole.  This represents a very
              interesting gene within the vacuolar localization machinery.  This project,
              which will be carried out during a sabbatical year, entails the cloning and
              characterization of the VPS 47 gene.  Insight into the function of this and
              other vps gene products will be gained from these characterizations.  ***
