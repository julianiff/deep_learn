Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is on the chemistry of organic compounds of   sulfur
              and selenium.  Major areas of effort are six-fold and include:     1) Dithiin
              chemistry, especially the synthesis and study of the reaction   chemistry of
              1,2-dithiins; 2) Synthesis and study of 1,2-dithiocins,   1,4-dithiocins,
              higher ring homologs of 1,2-dithiins and likely thermal   sources of singlet
              S2; 3) Research on Allium chemistry; 4) Investigation    of the chemistry of
              shiitake mushroom flavorants; 5) Development of new   reagents for organic
              synthesis, and; 6) Characterization of highly   reactive small organosulfur
              compounds using microwave spectroscopy.   With this renewal award, the
              Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the   research of Dr. Eric Block of the
              Chemistry Department at SUNY, Albany.    Professor Block will focus his work on
              the chemistry of organic compounds   of sulfur and selenium.  The projects in
              this broadly based research   program range from the study of the chemistry of
              garlic and onion to the   development of new reagents for organic synthesis.
