Abstract    :
              Kammerer, Martin T  U. of Southern California   The research is directed toward
              an improved understanding of process-response interactions within river
              channels.  Specifically, the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of
              bottom roughness elements and sediment transport rates will be examined with
              particular focus on feedback interactions.  It is hypothesized that bedforms
              exert important controls on in-channel processes and thereby influence the
              spatial and temporal distribution of sediment transport rates and pathways. 
              Frictional components of bedforms are viewed as active, rather than passive. 
              This ultimately has important ramifications for channel stability.  The crucial
              aspect of the work is to evaluate sediment transport processes in light of a
              drag-partitioned view of the fluid power available in a river system.  A
              detailed study of velocity profiles, sediment transport rates and bottom
              configuration will be collected in the Green River of Colorado.  The data will
              be analyzed within 'local' and 'spatial' frameworks.  The results will yield
              new understanding of sediment transport predictive capabilities and bedform
              existence fields.
