Abstract    :
              This work by Profs. Jon F. Parcher and Kwang S. Yun of the University of  
              Mississippi focuses on fundamental studies of phase distribution   equilibria
              using chromatographic techniques and is supported by the   Analytical and
              Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division.    Chromatographic
              experiments will be carried out which will yield the   glass transition
              temperature of polymers.  The data will be used to test   and develop models
              for the correlation of the glass transition   temperature with composition. 
              Chromatographic approaches will be   developed for the measurement of the
              sorption of supercritical fluids,   including carbon dioxide, in polymer
              matrices.  Measurement of the   corresponding swelling of the polymer will
              yield the molar volume.  Phase   transitions produced by the sorption process
              will be determined.  This research project will examine the interaction of
              supercritical   fluids as mobile phases, particularly carbon dioxide, with
              polymer   materials as stationary phases to obtain basic thermodynamic
              information   about the uptake of mobile phase components by the stationary
              phase.  The   approach to making these measurements is chromatographic and is
              unique.    Success will establish an entirely new way to obtain this
              information   which would be superior to methods currently in use.  The results
              of this   study will have immediate application in the separation of complex  
              chemical mixtures and in the production of plastics.
