Abstract    :
              9628401  Ammon                            This research involves the combination
              of receiver-function and  surface-wave information into the construction of a
              mutually  consistent Earth-structure model of the crust and upper mantle.  
              Both receiver functions and surface waves are sensitive to the  shear velocity
              of the Earth but the information contained in these  waveforms is
              complementary.  Receiver functions are predominantly  sensitive to the velocity
              contrasts, the surface waves are  predominantly sensitive to slowly-varying
              velocity changes.   Combining this complementary information should produce
              better  images of the subsurface variations in shear velocity.  Work will 
              begin in North America.  The results will help to understand the  interaction
              between the curst and mantle during the evolution of  the continents.   ***
