Abstract    :
              9628225  Burchfiel   Study of active and young deformation in central and
              southern Bulgaria is of particular interest in that this deformation represents
              the northernmost extent of the Aegean extensional domain and thus represents an
              active example of back arc type extension adjacent to a zone of coeval
              subduction and convergence along the Hellenic subduction and convergence along
              the Hellenic subduction boundary.   Studies suggest that extensions is
              controlled by motion of the subducting plate, but the dynamic and detailed
              kinematic processes that characterize such systems remain poorly understood. 
              This project, collaborative with the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, will study
              the detailed kinematics of how northward termination of active subduction along
              the Hellenic subduction system is related to northward termination of coeval
              extension in the back-arc region and ultimately, to gain additional insight
              into the dynamic processes that drive these systems.
