Abstract    :
              A comprehensive program of research on congestion avoidance in high-speed
              Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks is proposed.  The seven congestion
              issues that will be addressed in this project include: response to bursty
              traffic (with rate control), coexistence with higher priority VBR and CBR
              traffic, fair bandwidth allocation, large number of low rate sources, RM cell
              policies, queue control, and interaction with higher layer protocols.  In order
              to ensure that the research results are adopted by the industry, the
              investigator will continue to work closely with ATM forum Traffic Management
              Group during the definition phase of the problem and its solution.
