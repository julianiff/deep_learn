              -------------------------------  Hello Cliff,         Thank you for the good
              news on the proposal.  My revised budgets are  making their way through our
              process and will get to you soon; my abstract   in non-technical language is
              below.  Revise away as you think best - and I   would appreciate feedback on
              how to do this (important) task better.         On a technical note - I take
              the panel's recommendation not to use  Century as the sole vehicle for
              integration - but I don't think writing our   own model for these systems is a
              very productive approach.  What I hope to   do is use what we learn here to
              affect how people in general model these   processes; tying it to Century is
              limiting, developing our own model that's   "best" for these systems is even
              more so...         And - the summary:         Soil fertility controls plant
              production and many other aspects of   ecosystems.  Nitrogen and phosphorus are
              the most important of the nutrients   governing soil fertility, and both the
              nature of ecosystems and their responses   to natural and human-caused change
              differ depending on whether nitrogen or   phosphorus is in the shortest supply.
               This research is designed to determine   how interactions between the cycles
              of nitrogen and phosphorus control plant   production in ecosystems, and with
              what consequences.  It makes use of a set  of forests in Hawaii that range in
              soil age from 300 to 4,100,000 year.  Most   factors, including tree species,
              are constant on this sequence, but fertility   on young soils is controlled by
              nitrogen, while that on old soils is phosphorus   controlled.  The sites thus
              facilitate our understanding of the basic processes   that regulate soil
              fertility and its consequences.            And I'll be happy to take another
              crack at it, if appropriate.  With  best wishes,     Peter Vitousek
