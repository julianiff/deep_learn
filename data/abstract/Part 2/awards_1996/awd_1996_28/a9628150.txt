Abstract    :
              9628150  Ruiz  The duration of hydrothermal activity capable of forming a large
              ore deposit and the source of ore-forming elements are central questions in the
              study of metallogenesis.  S particular isotopic method that can be useful in
              addressing these two questions is the Re-Os system because Os, as a siderophile
              element, is concentrated in sulfides.  thus it is theoretically possible to
              directly date sulfides instead of associated silicates by the Re-Os isotopic
              system and it is also possible to use the isotopic ratio of Os to trace the
              relative importance of crustal and mantle sources in ore deposits.  the P.I.s
              have already made great progress in using molybdenite to date ore deposits with
              Re-Os isotopes and here the P.I.s propose to:  (1) Continue their
              investigations of the post-crystallization behavior of molybdenite.  (2) 
              Determine the usefulness of other sulfides to date base metal porphyry systems
              by the isochron method.  (3)  Constrain, using Re-Os isotopes, the source of
              metals in base metal porphyry deposits, which represent accumulations of
              chalcophile elements within the earth's crust.  The results of this study will
              provide new insights into base metal porphyry metallogenesis and the crust
              mantle interactions in convergent margins.
