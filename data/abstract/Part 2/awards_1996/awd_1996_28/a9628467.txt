Abstract    :
              GLAZ  DMS-9628467  The Department of Mathematics at the University of Maryland, 
              College Park, will purchase $77,323 of equipment and will spend  $23,088 for
              personnel to support research in the mathematical  sciences.  The equipment
              will be used to study:  (1) Systems of  Conservation Laws and Applications to
              Computational Fluid and  Solid Mechanics; (2) Hydrodynamics near the
              liquid-vapor critical  point; (3) Fast Multilevel Boundary Element Algorithms;
              (4)  Dynamics of encapsulated vortices in nonlinear Schrodinger  equations, and
              (5) Eigenvalue Problems for Ordinary Differential  Equations.  We purpose to
              upgrade the RAM memory of the existing SGI Indigo2  workstation by 256MB and
              purchase two Indigo2 workstations with  250MHz R4400 chip, and one Indy
              workstation with a 200MHz R4400SC  chip.
