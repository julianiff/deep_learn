Abstract    :
                A key area of behavioral biology is the mechanisms of hormonal regulation of
              social behavior.  How the endocrine system and the environment, including the
              behavior of other individuals, might interact is of growing interest.  Yet
              hardly anything is known of the endocrine mechanisms for the regulation of
              social behavior of insects, in spite of their rich repertory of behavior. 
              Burying beetles prepare and bury small carcasses that will become food for
              their larvae.  They are unusual in several respects.  They must coordinate
              reproduction with the location of a necessary resource that is unpredictable in
              both time and space.  Their behavior must undergo regular changes from
              competitive to cooperative and from infanticidal to parental.  Males and
              females must also coordinate their reproductive behavior and endocrine system
              with those of their mates.  Dr. Scott's research project has the following
              aims:   1.  to establish the profiles of juvenile hormone (JH) and
              ecdysteroids, using radioimmunoassay, during a breeding cycle, especially
              during parental care, for both males and females,   2.  to identify the
              hormonal control of parental behavior, especially the cue for switching from
              infanticide to feeding and parental care of larvae, and   3.  to characterize
              the role of JH and ecdysteroids in establishment of reproductive dominance in
              communally breeding females.
