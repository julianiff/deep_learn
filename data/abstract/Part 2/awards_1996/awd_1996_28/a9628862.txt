Abstract    :
              This CAREER grant will focus on studying the solar atmosphere and magnetic
              fields for both active and quiet regions.  Using the existing instrumentation
              expertise in various departments of the New Jersey Institute of Technology, the
              PI will apply state-of-the-art devices to solar observations.  These devices
              include the infrared detectors, narrow bandpass infrared filters, super-speed
              CCD cameras, and super-speed real time data processors.  In addition, the PI
              will obtain and study best data sets from ground-based observatories and
              satellites to investigate (1) the structure and magnetic fields of several
              solar features at opacity minimum, (2) the relationship between the magnetic
              fields and dynamic phenomena on the quiet Sun, and (3) the structure and
              evolution of magnetic fields in active regions and solar flares.***
