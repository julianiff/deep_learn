Abstract    :
              9628716  Edwards   The coral reefs of western Sumatra offer an opportunity to
              document the timing, geographic extent and vertical deformations associated
              with two great historical subjection zone earthquakes and their prehistoric
              predecessors. Living corals also display evidence for recent submergence, which
              perhaps represents elastic loading prior t the next great earthquake. This
              project is a collaborative study of the active tectonics of this subduction
              zone taking advantage of the details of coseismic vertical changes recorded
              these corals. Participants include researchers at California Institute of
              Technology, University of Minnesota, University of California San Diego and
              Santa Cruz.  Results are expected to provide unusually complete information of
              vertical motions preceeding and caused by large earthquakes in an subduction
              setting.
