Abstract    :
              9628154  Yuen      The PIs propose to use fluid dynamical modeling techniques to
              study  the role of viscous heating in magmatic systems and will study  these
              effects in the generation of melts in mantle plumes and in  the formation and
              ascent of granitic diapirs.  They hypothesize  that viscous dissipation will
              prove important for understanding  both processes.  ***
