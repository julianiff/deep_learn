Abstract    :
              9628388  McKenna  Support is sought for the acquisition and installation of
              controlled environment growth chambers in the biology department greenhouse. 
              The addition of these chambers will significantly increase research
              capabilities in plant science, aid in recruitment of talented undergraduates,
              graduate students and new faculty, and provide a facility that can support
              precollege outreach programs designed to increase the entry of minority
              students in science careers.  The installation of controlled environment
              chambers will extend and enhance ongoing research in the areas of plant anatomy
              and development, phytoremediation, plant ecophysiology, plant ecology, plant
              systematics, mycology, plant molecular biology and genetics.  The facility will
              allow the institution to maintain experimental plant populations over long
              periods, maintain clones or plant families for genetic experiments, grow source
              material for cellular and molecular experiments including tissue culture, DNA
              analysis, and phytoremediation, maintain plants for systematic study, and
              design experiments under controlled environmental conditions to study cellular,
              physiological or ecological processes.
