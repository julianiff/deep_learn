Abstract    :
              9628351  Jordan     This research involves the determination of the structure of
              the  Earth's mantle in Australasia, eastern Asia, and the western  Pacific
              through a series of seismological experiments that begin  with a
              three-dimensional, high resolution tomographic study.   Motivation for the
              study comes from new stations in the study area  and new inversion techniques
              for a more diverse collection of  seismic phases.  Frequency dependent travel
              times of body waves,  guided waves, and surface waves can now be derived from a
              self-  consistent analysis of three-component seismograms recorded at  short
              epicentral distances, which makes them ideally suited for  regional tomography.
               Combination of these data with the band-  centered travel times of
              zeroth-order and first-order ScS  reverberation phases, allows inversion for
              mantle discontinuity  topography and lateral variations in polarization
              anisotropy.  The  resulting model has a direct bearing on the mode of mantle 
              convection which is the driving force for plate tectonics and  earthquakes. 
              This research is a component of the National  Earthquake Hazard Reduction
              Program.  ***
