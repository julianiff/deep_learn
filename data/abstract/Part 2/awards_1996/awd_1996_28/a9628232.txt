Abstract    :
              9628232  Green    This grant provides $93,300 as one-half support of  the costs
              of acquiring a new X-ray fluorescence  spectrometer (XRF) to be used for rapid,
              high  precision analysis of the major element chemistry  of geological
              materials in the University of  Alabama's Central Analytical Facility (CAF) in
              the  Bevill Material, Mineral, and Energy Research  Building..  Specific
              research projects to be  conducted utilizing the XRF will include studies  on
              the petrogenesis of ore deposits, granitic  magmas, basaltic magmas and
              arc-derived calc-  alkaline magmas as well as studies of thin films  by faculty
              in the materials sciences.  A new XRF  will complement the portfolio of
              analytical  geochemical instrumentation already housed in this  laboratory
              (ICP-MS; ICP-AES, EMP, XRD, AAS etc.)  This instrument, as part of the CAF,
              will serve  not only a diverse group of departmental and  institutional users,
              but also a number or regional  academic, government and industry researchers.
