Abstract    :
              9628265  Macfarlane           The Himalaya-Karakoram-Tibet Workshop provides an
              annual  opportunity for geologists, geophysicists, geochemists, 
              geomorphologists, and other workers to present and discuss recent  findings
              from work in the region.  The spring of 1996 will mark the  first time this
              Workshop has ever convened in the United States.   All previous meeting have
              been held in Europe (with the exception  of Kathmandu in 1994) and therefore
              many North American workers  have found it difficult to attend and meet their
              European and Asian  colleagues.  Recently, excellent advances have been made by
               American workers in Himalayan and Tibetan geosciences. To continue  this
              cutting-edge work, it is essential that we open all lines of  communication and
              collaboration with Asian and European  researchers.  In addition to covering
              various geological segments  of the Himalaya (i.e., the Indus-Tsangpo Suture
              Zone, the Tethyan  Himalaya, the Higher Himalayan Crystallines, the Lesser
              Himalaya,  and the Subhimalayan foreland), the Workshop will also organize 
              three special sessions:  Geodynamic models of the Himalaya and  Tibet; the
              Neotectonics and Quaternary Geology of the Himalaya and  Tibet; and Extensional
              tectonics in a compressional orogen, all of  which are subjects of much debate
              currently.  ***
