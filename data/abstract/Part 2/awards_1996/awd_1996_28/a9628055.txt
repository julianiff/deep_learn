Abstract    :
              Although there is ample evidence that primates consume and disperse viable seeds
              of many plant  species, there are few data top illustrate the importance of
              their role as seed dispersers in  determining the dynamics of tropical forests.
               This study will provide an assessment of the role  primate seed dispersal
              plays in determining the structure of the forest found in Kibale National 
              Park, Uganda.  A sixteen month study will be conducted at three sites in Kibale
              that differ  markedly in the density of primate seed dispersers  Two
              primate-fruit interactions have been  selected: (1) Uvariopsis congensis
              appears to rely on dispersal by the entire frugivorous primate  community,
              while (2) Monodora myristica is dispersed by only the largest primates in
              Kibale.   The densities of the primate seed dispersers will be contrasted with
              the abundance of adults,  saplings, and seedlings of these two species among
              the sites.  The possibility that the pattern of  primate seed dispersal is
              masked by other fruit-fugivore interactions will be assessed.
