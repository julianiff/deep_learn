Abstract    :
              9628178  Yin   Although Late Cenozoic intracontinental deformation over a broad
              region  of Asia has been attributed to the indentation of India into Asia, the
              relationship between the northward movement of India and the corresponding
              strain partitioning within Asia remains controversial.  Two ideas are
              current-that crustal thickening accommodates the convergence while the other
              employs lateral escape tectonics.  This project will address this classic
              problem by examining a correlary of the extrusion model, which predicts that
              large-scale, conjugate sets of strike-slip faults must operate simultaneously
              to facilitate eastward extrusion of Tibet.  This project will study several
              candidate faults and produce ages for their inception and duration and offsets.
               Results should help in resolving this long-standing problem.
