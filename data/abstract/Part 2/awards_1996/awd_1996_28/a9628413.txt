Abstract    :
              9628413  Voight  The broad long-term objective of this work is to improve our
              understanding of magmatic interactions in large-scale volcanic edifices
              collapse and associated explosive eruptions.  magma intrusion may trigger
              large-scale edifice failure.  Rapid edifice failure may in turn provoke
              destructive explosive events, including the phenomenon known as the 'directed
              blast'.  This project aims at understanding these interactive processes.  The
              best examples of true directed blasts are found at Mount St. Helens (1980),
              which has been thoroughly studied, and Bezymianny Volcano (1956), which has
              been little studied.  Therefore the proposed research focuses on the Bezymianny
              blast deposit, and its relation to the debris avalanche that triggered the
              blast process.  The proposed research builds on recent preliminary field
              studies at Bezymianny by Belousov and Belousov, and collaborating scientists,
              which suggest that the Bezymianny blast deposits are not analogous with known
              pyroclastic surge deposits, with the sole exception of Mount St. Helens.  Field
              work will comprise standard techniques of study of stratigraphic relationships,
              mapping, sampling, sedimentology, and study of bed forms.  Samples will be
              subject to granulometric analyses and studied with SEM, XRD and microprobe. 
              Temperature data will be established from carbonized wood fragments.  Grain
              size distribution, shapes and compositions of particles, together with field
              observations, will provide the basis for interpretation of eruption processes. 
              The study is expected to have significant implications on volcanic hazards.
