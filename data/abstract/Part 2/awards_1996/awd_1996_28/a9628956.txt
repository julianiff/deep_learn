Abstract    :
              9628956  Gorchov    This Americas Program award will support a dissertation 
              enhancement project by Mr. Evan M. Notman, Miami University,  on the
              investigation of the influence of seed characters on  seed predation in a
              Peruvian lowland tropical forest.  He  will work under the direction of Dr.
              David L. Gorchov.        This study will investigate levels of post-dispersal
              seed  predation for a variety of tropical rain forest tree  species, and relate
              observed differences in seed predation  among species to seed characteristics. 
              Because other  factors such as abiotic conditions and predator abundances  may
              also affect seed predation, Notman will do comparisons  on the influence of
              seed characters on levels of seed  predation across forests of three different
              ages and between  invertebrate and vertebrate seed predators.        It is
              important to understand this influence in order to  understand how interactions
              between plants, animals, and  abiotic conditions affect forest regeneration.
              The results  obtained will be useful for forest management by improving 
              predictions about the impact of seed predation on  regeneration under diverse
              conditions.    ***
