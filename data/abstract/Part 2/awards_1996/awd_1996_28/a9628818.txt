Abstract    :
                  The principal investigator will develop on-line statistical techniques for 
              the operations and management of ATM networks.  The statistical techniques 
              include: estimating the quality of service, estimating the spare resources, 
              and improving network operations.  The motivation for this work is: 1) 
              user-network contracts specify a quality of service that is difficult to 
              verify and 2) the network needs to monitor its performance in real time to 
              improve its operations.    Some users will want to monitor the QoS that the
              network provides.  For  instance, if the user is a service reseller, he may
              want to protect himself  against complaints from subscribers.  Similarly, the
              network will use such  monitoring for quality control and also for improving
              its operations.  Given the likely penetration of ATM networks, improving the
              operations and  management of these networks is an important objective.    The
              statistical properties of quality of service estimators are difficult  to
              analyze on realistic models.  Consequently, this research will combine 
              analysis, simulation, and actual experiments to develop the on-line 
              techniques.
