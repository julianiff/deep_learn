Abstract    :
              A structured methodology for validating and verifying behavioral models is being
               explored.  The methodology is adapted from a set of software test and
              validation  criteria, which are based on control and data flow properties of
              the behavioral  model under test.  The test criteria are measured by a set of
              coverage metrics  which indicates the types and the locations of untested
              portions in the model.   The methodology includes an adaptive test data
              generation technique using neural  networks.  Given the untested portions in
              the model, effective test data are  generated and identified by neural networks
              to exercise the untested portions.  Tools which will provide designers with a
              quantitative confidence index at the  end of their testing and verification
              efforts are being developed.
