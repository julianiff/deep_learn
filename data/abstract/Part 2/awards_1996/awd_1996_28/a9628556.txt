Abstract    :
              9628556  Klotz      Nitrogen  is the element most frequently limiting  to  plant
               growth.  Yet,  excess use of fertilizers can lead  to  local  excesses  of 
              nitrogen  which  have  negative  environmental  impacts.   Nitrification is a
              key process  in  the  nitrogen  cycle resulting in N loss from ecosystems,
              eutrophication of  surface   and   ground   water   and   the   production   of
               atmospherically   active   trace   gases.    The    bacteria  responsible for
              the first step in nitrification are known as  ammonia  oxidizing  bacteria. 
              Basic ecological  aspects  of  soil ammonia oxidizing bacteria remain poorly
              characterized,  at   least  partially  because  the  existing  methods   for 
              examination  of  these  bacteria  in  the  environment   are  difficult  to
              use.  This study will develop new methods  for  the  characterization of the
              quantity and diversity of these  important soil bacteria based on the genetic
              material  which  encodes  a  key enzyme of ammonia oxidation.  These  methods 
              will  be  applied  to  examine the  soil  ammonia  oxidizing  bacteria  in a
              dryland wheat agricultural system  and  in  a  western montane forest site.
