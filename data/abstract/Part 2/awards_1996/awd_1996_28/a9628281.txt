Abstract    :
              9628281  White  This project is an integrated field, petrological, and
              geochemical study of Volcan Ecuador, Isla Isabela, Galapagos.  The immediate
              objectives of this study are as follows:  1. Determine the eruptive and
              structural history of the volcano through field studies and K-Ar dating.  2. 
              Obtain a sufficiently complete suite of chemical data so that the liquid line
              of descent can be determined and the nature of the parental magmas constrained.
               3.  Identify  any temporal trends in composition, through analysis of suites
              of samples whose ages are constrained by a combination of stratigraphy and K-Ar
              dating.  For this purpose, samples will be taken from stratigraphic  sections
              exposed in fault scarps and caldera walls.  Determine what, if any, effect has
              the apparent faulting on Ecuador had on magma composition?  Laboratory based
              work will include major element analyses, petrographic studies, electron
              microprobe analyses of mineral phases, Sr, Nd, Pb, and Hf isotopic analyses,
              and trace element analyses.  The results obtained will be used, along with
              thermodynamic models of magmas, to model magma generation and evolution.  These
              will be compared with the results of studies of other volcanoes in the
              Galapagos.  This in turn will be used to address the problem of how the
              Galapagos mantle plume interacts with lithosphere and asthenosphere at shallow
              levels in the mantle beneath the Galapagos.  The proposed study is a joint
              Franco-American project involving a collaboration between Francis Albarede of
              the Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Dennis Geist of the University of Idaho,
              and William White of Cornell University.
