Abstract    :
              9628575  Vallance  This study will focus on the dating and correlation of tephra
              layers and their association with downstream debris flows and pyroclastic flows
              with the goal of delineating the postglacial volcanic history of Mount Rainier
              and the behavior of the volcano during eruptive cycles.  It will have as
              secondary goals the development and refinement of geochemical correlation
              techniques for andesitic tephras, and the magmatic evolution of the volcano
              during postglacial time at Mount Rainier volcano.  The goals of the project
              will be met through traditional field methods and through geochemical
              fingerprinting and correlation techniques.  Traditional methods include basic
              stratigraphy, radiocarbon dating, and component analysis of ferromagnesian
              minerals.  Geochemical fingerprinting will be accomplished by analyzing whole
              rock and groundmass glass for major and trace elements and by microprobing
              groundmass glass and ferromagnesian minerals for major and minor elements then
              applying statistical analysis of similarity and variation coefficients to test
              possible correlations.  The proposed study would greatly improve the hazard
              assessment at Mount Rainier by synthesizing stratigraphic sequences of past
              eruptions into genetic packages.  Once understood, past eruptions can be used
              as models for potential behavior at the volcano if it becomes active.
