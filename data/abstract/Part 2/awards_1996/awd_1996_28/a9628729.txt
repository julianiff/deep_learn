Abstract    :
                  This is a joint effort with Lixia Zhang, University of California Los 
              Angeles, under award NCR-9628125.    Many applications require reliable
              multipoint data delivery.  Some well  known examples are netnews, electronic
              mailing list, and network routing  protocols such as BGP.  Up until now,
              however, due to the lack of widely  available support for both IP multicast and
              reliable multicast transport,  these applications have been using multiple TCP
              connections to achieve  reliable data delivery to multiple destinations, which
              results in both poor  scalability and inefficient utilization of network
              resources.    The goal of this research is to develop a framework and a set of
              mechanisms  to provide efficient, robust, scalable, and reliable multicast data
               delivery both over very large networks and with very large multicast  groups.
              The basic principles that have guided the design include the  application level
              framing (ALF), the IP multicast group concept and  receiver-initiated group
              management, and the core design principles of  TCP/IP --- simple datagram
              service, the end-to-end approach to reliability,  and automatic adaptation to
              changing operational environment.    The research will (1) systematically
              investigate the scaling issues with  the proposed adaptive error recovery
              scheme; (2) develop mechanisms to  localize error recovery traffic and
              substantially reduce the recovery  overhead in the current design; (3) develop
              flow and congestion algorithms  for many-to-many multicast data delivery; and
              (4) investigate new models  for session message distribution to further improve
              the scalability.
