Abstract    :
                Abstract        Research Related Revenues and Undergraduate Education in  
              Public Research Universities    Larry L Leslie, Gary Rhoades, and Ronald L.
              Oaxaca  University of Arizona  Center for the Study of Higher Education 
              Tucson, AZ 85721      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of
              changes in institutional revenue patterns on undergraduate education within
              science, mathematics, and engineering of US public research universities.  The
              study uses existing data bases to develop a model of research support based on
              "resource dependency theory" which holds that internal organizational
              activities are primarily influenced through the actions of external resource
              providers.   The proposal will assess the magnitude of public university
              revenue changes, measure impacts of research revenues on undergraduate
              education in SME units, and assess changes in curricular structures.
