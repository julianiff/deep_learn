Abstract    :
              9628220  Agee  The proposed experiments are to determine the wetting behavior of
              molten Fe-alloy in perovskite and magnesiowuestite solid matrices. These
              experiments will investigate the influence of lower mantle minerals on molten
              Fe-alloy percolation. Results will place important constraints on models of
              Earth and planetary core formation. Three experimental strategies will be used:
              (1) Equilibrate (Mg,Fe)SiO3-perovskite, magnesiowuestite, and molten Fe-alloy
              in a multi-anvil device at subsolidus, high-pressure conditions (~ 20 GPa),
              from Homestead L5 chondrite. Dihedral angles of crystal-crystal-liquid
              interfaces will be measure on quenched run products to quantify grain boundary
              wetting and alloy melt connectivity. (2) Equilibrate synthetic mixtures of
              CaSiO3-perovskite, magnesiowustite, and molten Fe-alloy at subsolidus
              temperatures in the pressure range 16-20 GPa. These experiments will provide a
              cross check on the dihedral angle measurements and textural equilibrium. (3)
              Experiments will be done to examine the wetting angle of perovskites +
              magnesiowuestite in a sulfur-free system. These experiments will offer new data
              on the relationship between alloy composition and wetting angle behavior.
