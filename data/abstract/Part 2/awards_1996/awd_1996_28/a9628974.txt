Abstract    :
              9628974  Zumberge    This grant provides $53,209 as partial support of 
              investigator salaries and the costs of computing  equipment to be used in an
              absolute gravity  resurvey of sites in California together with  testing of a
              new fringe-signal processing  technique.  Specifically, surveys and instrument 
              calibrations will be made at 7 sites using a new  Micro-g solutions Model FG5
              absolute gravity meter  together with an older IGPP-AGM-1 instrument which  was
              used at these sites six years ago.  The newer  instrument provides
              approximately five times  greater sensitivity in the measurement of local 
              acceleration of gravity.  The comparison between  measurements using both
              instruments is important  for calibration of the newer instrument in order  to
              monitor secular changes in vertical tectonic  displacements at these sites. 
              Without such a  calibration study, the older measurements would be  lost as a
              baseline with the retirement of the IGPP-  AGM-1.  Resurvey of these sites is
              timely as  sufficient time has passed so that the centimeter  scale vertical
              resolution possible with absolute  gravimetry will allow significant
              determination of  rates of vertical crustal deformation in this  tectonically
              active region of the world.  Of  particular interest, these measurements, when
              made  in conjunction with GPS or satellite laser ranging  (SLR) as independent
              measures of vertical  displacement, should yield insight into the  mechanisms
              responsible for deformation.  Historical SLR measurements exist for two of the 
              proposed resurvey sites, namely, Quincy and  Monument Peak.  ***
