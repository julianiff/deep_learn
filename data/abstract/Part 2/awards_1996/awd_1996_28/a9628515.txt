Abstract    :
              9628515  Mahoney   A key controversy in the US and Canadian Cordillera concerns
              the amount and timing of   northward translation of allochthouous terranes.  
              Paleomagnetic data imply large-scale translation of both   Insular and
              Intermontane  terranes between late Cretaceous and Eocene times, but geologic
              data   apparently limits the total margin-parallel displacement to much smaller
              amounts since late Cretaceous   time.   This investigation will attempt to
              resolve the controversy by testing a specific prediction of the   large-scale
              translation hypothesis, namely  a large (2000 km) relative displacement between
              the  80-55   ma, by use of upper Cretaceous strata, and an examination
              stratigraphic linkages between the rocks of this   age that are found on both
              superterranes.   Results are expected to provide robust data to resolve this  
              controversy, which should also be useful in providing insight into the record
              of large-scale displacements   in other orogenic systems.
