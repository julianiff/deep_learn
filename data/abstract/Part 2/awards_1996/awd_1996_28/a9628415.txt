Abstract    :
              9628415  Crippens    This project creates and implements a national parent
              engagement  and education campaign.  It provides a framework for all parents to
               explore existing and alternative forms of assessment within the  context of
              changes in current classroom math curriculum and  practices.  The campaign also
              provides a mechanism for enhancing  communication between teachers, schools and
              parents in order to  ensure support for math strategies and practices by all
              members of  learning communities nationwide.  Project products include:        
              *    A thirty-minute documentary on mathematics reform and           
              assessment, to be broadcast by public television            stations, that will
              also include a viewer's guide and            local publicity materials.        
              *    A Community Education Kit containing a Leader's Guide,            Parent's
              Handbook, and short videotapes.    Project materials and activities are
              designed for parents of  elementary-age children, with a specific emphasis for
              materials on  grades 3-5.
