Abstract    :
              Furlong  9628347   Active plate boundary tectonism involves a number of
              geophysical and geodynamical plate boundary processes,  not all of which are
              well understood. Improving our understanding of the tectonic behavior of major
              plate boundaries in continental regions requires answering a broad range of
              questions, including: what is the interaction and coupling between  upper
              crustal seismogenic processes and lower crustal mantle deformation?, how does
              the evolving thermal region affect the distribution of strain?, how does
              crustal heterogeneity affect patterns of deformation? and what is the origin of
              structures in these settings. The large amounts of data on the San Andreas
              Fault system coupled with advances in modeling makes progress on these
              fundamental questions feasible. Results are expected to clarify the important
              parameters involved in predicting plate boundary deformation as well as
              significantly improve understanding of the San Andreas system.
