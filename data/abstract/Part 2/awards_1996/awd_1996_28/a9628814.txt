Abstract    :
                    This multi-disciplinary SGER project involves collaborative  research in
              the areas of biochemistry, surface chemistry, and  algorithm design. The main
              goal of the project is to develop  an approach to computation and information
              storage, using DNA  sequences. Although this approach is both ``novel'' and
              ``high-  risk'', there is a high potential that this new  DNA/biomolecular
              computing approach will yield ``solutions''  to intractable/NP-complete
              problems. To this end, the project  concentrates on: (1) Developing and
              characterizing complex  mixtures of DNA molecules attached to surfaces, by 
              characterizing, for the absorbed DNA molecules,(a) the  attachment chemistry,
              (b) the hybridization chemistry, and  (c)the enzymatic activity, using a
              variety of spectroscopic  and biochemical methods; (2) Optimizing the use of
              the  manipulations of DNA sequences in developing molecular  computing
              strategies for solving NP-complete problems;  (3)Developing new algorithms for
              solving the NP-complete  problems; and (4) Investigating surface-based methods
              for high  density storage and retrieval of information by DNA  hybridization
              chemistry.
