Abstract    :
                This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of biophysics. 
              The thermodynamic and kinetic properties of  in vitro and in vivo protein
              folding are being studied by  computational and analytical methods using
              lattice and off-  lattice models.  The experimental problems being 
              investigated involve protein design, chaperone mediated  folding, modeling of
              realistic protein structures such as  for cytochrome c and the analytical
              calculation of folding  rates.
