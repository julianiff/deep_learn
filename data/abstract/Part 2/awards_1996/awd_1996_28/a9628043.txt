Abstract    :
              9628043  Dueker     This research involves use of newly acquired PASSCAL seismic
               broad-band digital data to improve knowledge of the Colorado  Plateau's
              lithospheric structure and address the origin of the  Colorado Plateau's
              uplift.  This unresolved Cenozoic uplift  occurred after the plateau remained
              essentially at sea-level for  most of its 1.7 billion year history.  Proposed
              analysis will  involve construction of common midpoint stacks of receiver 
              functions, measurement of teleseismic P and S wave travel times,  measurement
              of Pn travel times from two Deep Probe shots, and  shear-wave splitting
              measurements for the 4 suitable SKS events  recorded.  The results should
              provide information on Moho depth,  crustal and upper mantle velocities, and
              seismic velocity  anisotropy due to fossil strain and/or recrystallization
              processes.  ***
