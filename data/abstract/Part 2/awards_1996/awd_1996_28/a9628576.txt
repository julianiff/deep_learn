Abstract    :
              9628576  Yeats   Rates of  deformation are data that are difficult to obtain,
              but essential for the understanding of active tectonism in any tectonic
              environments. Rates of deformation are determined by various means, both
              directly and indirectly, but commonly employ phenomena of tectonic
              geomorphology are currently almost entirely based on subaerial landforms, even
              though most active plate boundaries are offshore. This project will attempt to
              use subsea landforms off  the Cascadia Coast to estimate shortening rates
              during that part several thousand years. Results should illustrate the
              potential of active tectonics studies offshore to add considerable rate
              information for on-going deformation.
