Abstract    :
              9628522  Adams    This grant supports a group of six mathematicians at the
              University of Georgia with interrelated interests. Research areas lie in
              geometry and topology including Seiberg-Witten theory, characteristic classes
              of singular varieties, integrable systems and Hamiltonian dynamics, and the
              Schottky problem. Partial support is provided for travel, a workshop, two
              postdoctoral researchers, and several graduate students.    Seiberg-Witten
              theory lies in the interface of geometric analysis, topology and algebraic
              geometry; it is a recent discovery motivated by problems in theoretical
              physics. In this theory, electric-magnetic duality plays a crucial role which
              states roughly that electricity and magnetism are two phases of a single
              underlying phenomenon.
