Abstract    :
              9628340  Tullis    The PI proposes to conduct laboratory experiments to
              determine flow  laws for dislocation creep and fluid-assisted diffusion creep
              of  feldspar aggregates.  Feldspar constitutes the dominant phase in  the
              earth's crust and probably is the strongest phase in the middle  portions of
              the continental crust, but as yet there are no flow  laws for this mineral. 
              These studies will provide quantification  that will allow greatly improved
              limits to be placed on the  reheology of the middle crust.  ***
