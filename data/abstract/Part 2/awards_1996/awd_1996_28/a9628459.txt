Abstract    :
              Grau, Hector R  U. of Colorado, Boulder   This project will assess how tree
              species diversity is affected by disturbances across a range of spatial scales,
              and how disturbance regimes are related to elevational gradients in subtropical
              montane forests in northwestern Argentina.  It is hypothesized that in the
              higher montane forest, low diversity is maintained by frequent fire.  In the
              lower montane forest, high diversity is promoted by the occurrence of
              small-scale treefall gaps.  Abrupt changes in diversity between the higher and
              lower montane forest are believed to be caused by shifts in disturbance regimes
              that reflect the influences of both the underlying physical environmental
              gradients and vegetation responses to these gradients.  Research methods will
              include dendroecological records of disturbance regimes at a stand and
              landscape scale, spatial and temporal patterns of tree recruitment in relation
              to bamboo cover, stand-scale measures of diversity, and the use of remote
              sensing to map the limit between lower and higher montane forests.  The results
              will yield information on how climatic change and anthropogenic changes in
              disturbance regimes affect biodiversity.
