Abstract    :
              9628578  Snoke      This research involves seismic and potential-field
              investigations  to improve resolution of seismogenic crustal features in
              basement  rocks below the Paleozoic thrust sheets in eastern Tennessee.  The 
              Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone (ETSZ) is a pronounced zone of  earthquake
              activity in a region 300 by 50 km with earthquake  hypocenters extending from 5
              to 25 km in depth.  The zone produces  the second highest release of seismic
              strain energy east of the  Rocky Mountains and is unique in that it is
              associated with  regional-scale potential-field (gravity and magnetic)
              anomalies.   Seismic recording of quarry blasts will be done to test the 
              feasibility of this technique for the study of crustal structure.  
              Concurrently, analysis and inversion of existing potential field  data will be
              done.  Seismic and potential-field data analysis will  be integrated to provide
              a better understanding of structures  responsible for earthquakes within the
              region and outline the best  approach for further efforts.  This research is a
              component of the  National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
