              Signals in GCM Microwaves Maps: The 1980s- Early  1990s and the 21st Century   
              The goal of this proposal is to narrow the gap between the  microwave observed
              and GCM generated global temperature trends  during the period of 1980s to
              early 1990s.  To this end  series of  coupled model experiments will be
              performed and utilized.   Understanding the trend differences is a fundamental
              problem in  climate change detection research.  This twenty-four grant is to 
              aid in achieving this understanding.
