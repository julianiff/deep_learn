Abstract    :
              9628647  Fuller    The PIs propose to analyze global magnetic reversal records
              that  they have compiled in the "Reversal Atlas."  The work will include  the
              development of a new spherical harmonic analysis and its  application to
              reversal records and secular variation.  ***
