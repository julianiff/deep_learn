Abstract    :
              A major bottleneck in present-day machine translation (MT) is identifying
              appropriate approximations when no exact translation exists between the source
              and target languages.  An MT system must resolve mismatches either by
              incorporating implicit information from context or leaving out some information
              in the source text.  A prototype MT system is implemented, incorporating the
              usual MT steps, analysis (analyzing English sources into an English-oriented
              semantic representation), transfer (transferring the English-oriented semantics
              into a Japanese-oriented semantics), and generation (building Japanese targets
              from the transferred semantics), and adding a novel Mismatch Resolution Module
              (MRM) called when generation fails.  In this architecture, both analysis and
              generation modules are purely monolingual, and transfer is simplistic,
              incorporating minimal context information, and the bulk of mismatch resolution
              and disambiguation is done in the generation-MRM loop, where the MRM offers
              solutions to the problems encountered by generation. Two kinds of MRMs are
              explored, logical and statistical, with the design goal of a single MRM
              combining the advantages of both approaches.  Translations are evaluated by
              monolingual English speakers applying evaluation measures modeled on those of
              the DARPA MT program.  The focus is on translating the Japanese joint venture
              business articles in the MUC-5 corpus into English.  This project attacks the
              crucial mismatch resolution problem with a novel architecture, logical and
              statistical techniques, and on-line text resources.
