Abstract    :
              9628494  Masters    This research is a continuation of the definition of the
              large-  scale structure of the Earth by means of the use of long-period and 
              broad-band digital data to constrain elastic and inelastic  structure.  The
              current emphasis is on pushing the analysis to  smaller length scales and on
              incorporating the effects of  anisotropy.  Seismic data sets will be expanded
              to improve global  coverage, locally densify to the point that regional-scale
              studies  are viable, and improve the precision of attenuation measurements.  
              The mean travel times obtained from such studies are also useful in  the
              development of new one-dimensional models and in the evaluation  of the effect
              of the absorption band on the frequency-dependence of  travel times.  New data
              sets will be developed based on the  polarization or particle motion of body
              waves; they are expected to  be sensitive to small-scale structure and
              anisotropy.  Research  will be done on new parameterizations which allow
              regional  densification to accommodate the improved resolution of the new  data
              sets.  ***
