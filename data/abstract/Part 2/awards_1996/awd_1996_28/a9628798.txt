Abstract    :
                This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of microbial
              genetics.  The mechanism by which a bacterium  survives exposure to the toxic
              metal mercury is being  studied using the Tn21 mercury resistance operon from a
               plasmid of the bacterium Shigella flexeri.  The study will  determine how a
              regulatory protein, MerR, binds to DNA and  induces expression of a structural
              gene, merTPCAD, in  response to mercury exposure.  It will be determined how 
              MerR distinguishes between mercury and other heavy metals  also encountered in
              the environment.  Mutants whose MerR  recognize cadmium and zinc will be
              generated and  characterized.
