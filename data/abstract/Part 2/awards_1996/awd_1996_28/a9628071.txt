Abstract    :
              9628071  Silver      The PI proposes a GPS field and dynamic modeling
              investigation in  Papua New Guinea focused on understanding the changes in
              width and  strain rates of the transition from subduction at the New Britain 
              trench to collision in New Guinea, which provides an ideal example  of the many
              stages of arc-continental collision.  ***
