Abstract    :
              9628262  Wernicke   The South Virgin Mountains, Nevada, occupy the easternmost
              portion of the highly extended Lake Mead region.   We request funds for
              completion of detailed geologic mapping and geochronologic studies in the South
              Virgin Mountains Nevada.   In terms of exposure, stratigraphic resolution,
              topographic relief and a regional datum for reconstruction, the South Virgin
              Mountains are among the best examples of upper crustal imbricate normal fault
              structure in the world.  Mapping to date by the PI and graduate student Robert
              Brady suggests that domino-style, "rolling-hinge," and rollover kinematics are
              all probably active within the system, but may be operative at different times
              and places across strike of the rift.  Hence the area offers the potential to
              test the applicability of these models, and possibly determine how structural
              position within a series of tilted blocks influences their development.  In
              addition to geologic mapping, we propose to complete Ar/Ar and U-Th/He dating
              of selected samples to establish absolute ages of basin formation and unroofing
              of the blocks, respectively.   In the case of the latter method, which has a
              uniquely low closure temperature of about 70oC in the mineral apatite, this
              project will be the first application of He dating to the problem of
              extensional tectonics.
