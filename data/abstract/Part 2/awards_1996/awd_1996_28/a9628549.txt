Abstract    :
              9628549  Johnson   During the Mesozoic a well developed continental magmatic arc
              was active along the Pacific margin of the U.S., which by late Cretaceous to
              early tertiary time became fragmented and extensively rearranged by the
              development of extensional collapse and San Andreas transform faulting. The
              Salinian Black is a displaced and distinded fragment of the central link of
              this arc. The Gualala Basin contains late cretaceous -early tertiary
              conglomerates related to this fragmentation, thus provides an opportunity to
              help track tectonic blocks of arc rocks by examining  affinities of the basin's
              cobbles and conglomerates. This work is to use modern isotopic analysis to
              establish lithologic and temporal links between cobbles in the Gualala Basin
              and proposal source terranes. Definitive correlation's produced would be
              valuable in dueriminating between the several extant models for the collapse
              and fragmentation of this arc.
