Abstract    :
              9628156  Kent    This grant provides $41,125 as one-half support of  the costs
              of acquiring a direct-current (DC) SQuID  upgrade for an existing 2G Model 760 
              superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) as well as  a new impulse magnetizer
              for the Lamont-Doherty  Earth Observatory.  The greater sensitivity  afforded
              by the DC-SQuID upgrade will allow this  lab to measure previously unobtainable
               paleomagnetic records from very weakly magnetized  sediments and the impulse
              magnetizer will allow  the generation of very high magnetic fields (up to  5
              Tesla) for use in rock magnetic research.  This  equipment will allow this
              laboratory to continue  and expand their cutting-edge paleomagnetic and  rock
              magnetic research.  ***
