Abstract    :
                  This research proposal seeks to use fractal or self-similar models to 
              describe the long-range correlations observed in measurements of traffic  from
              actual networks, and apply techniques to deal with fractal models,  well-known
              in physics but hardly ever used in the area of network  performance analysis,
              to obtain relevant insight into the performance of  modern high-speed networks
              for their design, management, and control.    The research seeks to quantify
              the impact of fractal traffic  characteristics on network performance, building
              on the present experience  with self-similar traffic models.  First, the work
              will extend the  understanding of simple single-server models achieved by the
              PIs and other  authors.  The effects of complications such as multiple service
              classes and  finite buffer sizes, and the modifications needed when self
              similarity is  only asymptotic (relevant for variable-bit-rate services) will
              be  considered.  Second, the effects of connecting a large number of nodes in a
               network will be investigated including issues such as the robustness of  self
              similarity.  Finally, the project will tackle the difficult problems  of
              understanding the transformations induced on self similar traffic by  network
              controls as well as the consequences of self similarity on the  effectiveness
              of the controls themselves.    The work will consist of constructing simple
              models for networks, testing  their validity through numerical simulations, and
              comparing their behavior  with experimental measurements from real networks.  
              The behavior of these  models will be studied through a combination of
              numerical and analytical  techniques.
