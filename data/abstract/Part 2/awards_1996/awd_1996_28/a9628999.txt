Abstract    :
              This is developing a methodology and efficient techniques for evaluating and/or 
              predicting power dissipation of CMOS circuits. The major components of the 
              proposed methodology are survey sampling techniques, automata-based sequence 
              compaction techniques, a behavioral/logic level co-simulation engine, 
              regression-based power macro-modeling techliques, and information-theoretic 
              models of power dissipation.    Special emphasis is being given to parasitic
              capacitance estimation, input data  modeling, impact of memory hierarchy and
              circuit architecture, and effects of  nonlinear delay equations and custom wire
              load models on accuracy/efficiency  trade-offs of the estimators. Concurrently,
              CAD methodologies and techniques for  minimizing the power dissipation in VLSI
              circuits and systems are being  developed. These are: low power optimization
              techniques and prototype software  programs for system-level partitioning and
              hardware/software codesign,  communication synthesis, multiple supply voltage
              scheduling, activity-driven  register allocation and binding, bus encoding,
              state assignment for interacting  finite state machines, logic restructuring
              and simplification, timing-driven  placement, routing and zero-skew clock tree
              construction. Finally, power  management techniques such as (serial or
              parallel) gated clocks, stoppable  clocks, and dynamic switching between power
              modes are being studied and  automated.
