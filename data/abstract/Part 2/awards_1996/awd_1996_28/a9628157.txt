Abstract    :
                This project would address the way in which school district spending patterns
              influence student academic achievement and other educational outcomes.  It
              includes an analysis of the ways in which different types of spending
              (instruction, administrative, etc.) influence the academic achievement such as
              effective school organization.  The study would use a number of multivariate
              techniques such as structural equation models to analyze nationally
              representative linked data bases from the Common core of Data and the National
              Assessment for Education Progress. These two data bases combine the financial
              information of school districts with student assessment data of districts.
