Abstract    :
              9628045  Sofia    This Americas Program award will support Drs. Sabatino Sofia 
              and three other astronomers from Yale University,  Connecticut, to study the
              technical feasibility of mounting  a Charge Coupled Device (CCD)  drift scan
              camera on the 1m  Schmidt telescope in Venezuela operated by the Centro de 
              Investigacion de Astronomia (CIDA) at Llano del Hato,  Venezuela.  
              Collaborating with the group will be Dr.  Gustavo Bruzual, Director of CIDA and
              his partners.  The  combination of Schmidt optics, the equatorial site provided
               by the Venezuelan Schmidt, and CCD drift scan techniques,  should result in an
              uniquely powerful astronomical survey  machine.  Potential scientific
              applications which will be  made possible by the CCD camera will cover the
              entire range  of modern observational astrophysics, from searches for  nearby
              brown dwarfs, to studies of the structure of our  galaxy, to the cosmological
              implications of the distribution  of the most distant quasars.    Several
              technical issues must be resolved prior to the  installation of the CCD.  In
              particular, the geometry  required by the camera on the telescope, and the
              algorithms  for handling the large expected data rates must be  considered. 
              The objective of this proposal is to conduct  the necessary studies to resolve
              these issues.  ***
