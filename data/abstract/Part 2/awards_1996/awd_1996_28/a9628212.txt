Abstract    :
              9628212  Jenkins  Several projects are proposed to examine at the macroscopic
              and microscopic levels key issues dealing with the quantitative use of
              amphiboles as indicators of pressure, temperature and chemical history of their
              host geologic terrane. These include: (1) Basic characterization studies on
              ferro-actinolite in the system CaO-FeO-SiO2-H2O to determine whether or not
              there is substantial substitution of Fe+2 for Ca on the M(4) site and
              investigation of the extent of Al substitution into ferro-actinolite via the
              Fe-tschermaks substitution to test the influence of Fe+2 on the solubility of
              Al into amphibole. (2) An investigation of the importance of the bulk chemistry
              of the mineral assemblage (carbonate-bearing vs.  non-carbonate-bearing) and of
              the amphibole itself (tremolite-pargasite join) in the production of
              chain-width defects or variable-composition amphibole precursors.  (3) An
              investigation to determine the distribution of Al on the octahedral and
              tetrahedral sites of amphibole. Oxidation states will be determined via wet
              chemistry or M ssbauer spectroscopy and of crystal structure via x-ray Rietveld
              refinement. Direct analysis of the atomic structure will be done via HRTEM.
