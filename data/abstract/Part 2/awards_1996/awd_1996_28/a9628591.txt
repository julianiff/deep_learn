              Project:  U.S. Attendance at the 14th IFIP World Computer Congress    This
              award provides partial support for 20 representatives from the U.S. to attend
              the 14th IFIP World Computer Congress, in Canberra, Australia, September 2-6,
              1996.  The International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) is a
              multinational federation of technical organizations concerned with information
              processing.  The Federation on Computing in the U.S. (FOCUS), a joint activity
              of the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society, serves as the U.S. representative to
              IFIP and is administering this project.  The participants in the project are
              selected on a competitive basis by a committee of reviewers, with emphasis
              given to young researchers doing outstanding work and to applicants who have
              been accepted to present papers or are otherwise significantly involved in the
              conference.
