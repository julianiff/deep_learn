Abstract    :
              9628513 Farhat  The University of Colorado at Boulder will host the Tenth
              International Conference on Domain Decomposition Methods in Sciences and
              Engineering.  The Conference is scheduled to be held in summer 1997 on the
              Campus of the University of Colorado at Boulder.  The conference organizers are
              Professor Charbel Farhat from the Department of Aerospace Engineering Science
              at the University of Colorado Boulder, Professor Xiao Chuan Cai from the
              Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder,  and
              Professor Jan Mandel from the Department of Mathematics at the University of
              Colorado at Denver.  The profile of the organizers corresponds to the diverse
              constituencies of the Domain Decomposition field.  The conference is designed
              to promote the interaction between mathematicians, numerical analysts, physical
              scientists, engineers,  and computer scientists.  For this  tenth meeting, the
              focus theme will be High Performance Computing.  The conference organizers plan
              to devote a significant amount of effort on attracting the participation
              scientists not only from academia and government research laboratories, but
              also from the computing, simulation software, and key engineering industries. 
              Support will be provided for the active participation of graduate students who
              will benefit from exposing their research to a diversified audience of
              potential employers, and from keeping up-to-date with the latest developments
              in this field.***
