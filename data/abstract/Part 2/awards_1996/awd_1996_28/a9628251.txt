Abstract    :
              9628251  Feigenson  This project will focus on providing constraints on the
              geochemical character of island-arc volcanoes in Central America.  Previous
              work in Central America has indicated that the volcanoes in northern Costa Rica
              and southern Nicaragua display geochemical compositions that are consistent
              with a transition between two mantle terrains with different geological
              histories.  The first part of this study will focus on the Pb isotopic
              composition of the lavas from the vents along this portion of the arc with the
              purpose of defining this mantle terrain boundary and to evaluate if the
              underlying mantle was affected by the passage of this portion of the plate over
              the Galapagos hot-spot at about 90 million years ago.  The second objective of
              this study will be to measure the temporal variation in the subduction
              signature over the last 2-3 my at the segment of the arc immediately onshore by
              analysing a core of sediments (DSDP 495) for Ba/La, B/La, U/Th, Ba/Th and U/La.
               This will provide basic stratigraphic and geochemical data necessary to
              develop realistic models of recycling of sediments through to the mantle at
              convergent margins.
