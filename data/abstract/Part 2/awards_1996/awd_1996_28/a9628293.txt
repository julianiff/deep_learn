Abstract    :
              This proposed research uses a multidimensional approach to validating the
              constructs of student achievement in high school mathematics and science.  It
              elaborates and indicator of student achievement to enhance the validity of
              large scale education surveys.  Specifically it identifies knowledge and
              reasoning components of mathematics and reasoning test that are both multiple
              choice and constructed response using the NELS:88 High School Effects Study
              (HSES).  It analyses the constructed response tasks for con students of
              different gender and ethnicity's: it extends the construct approach to the
              National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) and develops improved
              procedures for conduction interview studies in item construct validation.  It
              also will develop guidelines for other investigators who apply multidimensional
              scoring of student test.
