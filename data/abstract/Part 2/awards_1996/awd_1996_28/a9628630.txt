Abstract    :
              9628630  VASERSTEIN    The Department of Mathematics at the Pennsylvania State 
              University will purchase workstations to be dedicated to the  support of
              research in the mathematical sciences.  Primary  attributes of the
              multiprocessor workstation are fast  integer performance and large main memory.
               Particular  research projects which are proposed are in automated  reasoning
              and theorem proving, left-distributive algebras  and cryptology, solving for
              rational points on cubic curves,  and determining global convergence properties
              of discrete  time dynamical games.  Methods involve integer, floating  point,
              symbolic and algebraic computations.
