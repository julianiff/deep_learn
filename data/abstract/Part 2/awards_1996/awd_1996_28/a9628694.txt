Abstract    :
              9628694  Heuer    The proposed research contains three topics: i) Deformation 
              twinning in undoped monoclinic zirconia (m-ZrO2 ) single  crystals and
              polycrystals as a function of load, orientation  and temperature will be
              studied using microhardness  indentation. At temperatures up to 1100C, m-ZrO2
              is the  stable phase.  The competition between indent-induced slip  and
              twinning will be studied; ii) Heating these crystals  into the tetragonal (t)
              phase field will allow similar  studies in t-ZrO2; here, the emphasis will be
              on slip  systems, the competition between slip and ferroelastic  deformation,
              and the role the indentation damage plays in  nucleating the martensitic t to m
              transformation on cooling;  iii) A bio-inspired chemical route to thin film
              formation of  pure and Y203-doped ZrO2 has been discovered.  The aqueous 
              chemistry needed to optimize film formation will be  systematically studied..
              Deposition of ZrO2-based films on  semiconductor grade Si and Ni-base alloys
              have implications  for oxygen sensors and thermal barrier coatings, 
              respectively.    The proposed research will examine the fundamental  mechanical
              behavior of zirconia-based ceramics.  Zirconia  has been used as a  model
              system for understanding  toughening in a number of other tough ceramics.  This
               proposal includes three research topics: deformation  twinning in 1)
              monoclinic and 2) tetragonal zirconia studied  by microhardness indentation,
              and 3) a study of the  chemistry to optimize the deposition of self-assembling
              thin  films of zirconia-based ceramics.   Understanding these self-  assembling
              films has the potential to enable materials  researchers to deposit a film of
              any material on any  substrate.
