Abstract    :
              9628739  Kincaid     The PIs propose a multi-disciplinary study to develop
              models of the dynamical, thermal and compositional evolution of the
              sub-continental upper mantle which are directly constrained by seismic shear
              wave splitting and geologic and petrologic data sets.  The team will develop
              and test a model that incorporates viscous heat production in an attempt to
              reconcile seemingly conflicting data sets which suggest that sub-continental
              mantle, specifically sub-continental lithosphere, is anomalously hot during
              orogeny and yet is not removed during orogeny.  ***
