Abstract    :
              9628051  Vidale     This research involves the use of earthquake recordings at
              dense  short-period seismic networks that are analyzed as an array to 
              delineate details of mantle structure, especially at and near the  core-mantle
              boundary and at discontinuities in the upper mantle.  Core reflections and
              refractions recorded at over 1000 seismic  stations in the western U.S. from
              more than 50 large earthquakes in  Central and South America will be used to
              image the heterogeneity  near the core-mantle boundary.  Approximately 100
              Nevada Test Site  nuclear tests recorded at west coast stations will be used to
               analyze reflections from the top of upper mantle discontinuities.   P'P'
              reflections from the bottom of the same discontinuities will  also be used as
              sensitive indicators of sharp changes in upper  mantle properties.  Study of
              these mantle heterogeneities and  discontinuities will help us learn about the
              Earth's convection  which is the driving force for plate tectonics and
              earthquakes.   This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard 
              Reduction Program.  ***
