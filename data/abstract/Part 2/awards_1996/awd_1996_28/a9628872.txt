Abstract    :
                96-28872  Holt    The PI proposes to investigate both the kinematics and
              dynamics of deforming continental  lithosphere in regions such as Asia, New
              Zealand, and Japan.  He will utilize kinematic  modeling techniques that he has
              developed and demonstrated are equivalent to the solutions  for the deformation
              of a thin viscous sheet, and in this proposal, will advance his research 
              toward a joint determination of both the kinematics and dynamics.  The
              advantage of joint  kinematic and dynamic analysis is that all of the dynamic
              solutions will be constrained by  observations.  This work will help advance an
              understanding of the kinematics and dynamics  of strain partitioning within
              zones of continental deformation, which is fundamental for the  quantification
              of earthquake hazards, and for the understanding of continental tectonics in 
              general.  The educational component of this proposal includes the preparation
              of a graduate  level textbook on continental kinematics and dynamics.  ***
