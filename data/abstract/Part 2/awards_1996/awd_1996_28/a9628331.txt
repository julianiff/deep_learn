Abstract    :
              9628331  Chamberlain       There are two competing scenarios for the Proterozoic
               convergence of the Superior and Wyoming Provinces and each  model has broad
              ramifications for the assembly of the North  American Continent.  Basically,
              one model has the collision  at about 1.85Ga with subsequent accretion of arc
              terranes to  the south, while the other model calls for considerable arc 
              terrane accretion to the Wyoming terrane, and this composite  terrane finally
              collided with the Superior terrane at 1.66  Ga.  This project will attack this
              problem in two places  where the structural boundary is exposed, and
              constitutes a  geochronological, geochemical and structural investigation 
              focused on the sequence and timing relationships.  Results  are expected to
              constrain tectonic reconstruction scenarios  for the Proterozoic assembly of
              central North America.
