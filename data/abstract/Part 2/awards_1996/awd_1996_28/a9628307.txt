Abstract    :
                                    BIOTECHNOLOGY WORKS!                      University of
              Southern Maine                          P. I. Libby Cohen    Biotechnology
              Works! recognizes the National Science Foundation's  priority to facilitate the
              participation of persons with  disabilities in mathematics and science.  During
              two summers and  two school years (1996-1998), this project will demonstrate
              that an  existing curriculum for high school students in biotechnology can  be
              adapted for students with disabilities.  In addition, the  project will
              demonstrate that high school teachers, who work along  side their students, are
              able to modify their instruction and  laboratories.  Specifically, the project
              staff will:  1) offer  intensive sessions in biotechnology, and mathematics
              that are  related to biotechnology, for students in grades 10-12; 2) train  the
              students' high school biology teachers to adapt high school  science coursework
              in immunology and genetics for students with  disabilities; and 3) disseminate
              project information and products.   The project goal is to demonstrate that
              students with  disabilities can participate successfully in existing high
              school  level biotechnology educational activities that have been modified  and
              adapted to meet their needs.  Ten teachers and 10 students  with disabilities
              will participate in the project which will be  offered in three locations:  the
              University of Southern Maine,  Foundation for Blood Research, and the Maine
              Medical Center.   This will give the students and their teachers the
              opportunity to  work in real laboratories with scientists.  ***
