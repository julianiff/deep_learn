Abstract    :
              9628540   Wells   Theoretical and analog models of contractional mountain belts
              have shown that extensions can occur within mountain belt interiors both
              synchronously with and immediately following contraction. The major implication
              for understanding the dynamics of mountain building have been outlined, but
              many important aspects remain unclear. This project will utilize an area where
              the effects of magmatism on the kinematic sequence within a contractional
              mountain belt can be studied. The eastern Mojave Desert is a setting where a
              backarc fold and thrust belt intersects and is coincident with a coeval
              magmatic arc. This geometry, with differing extension directions should allow a
              test of  whether a discontinuous belt of Cretaceous extension exists across the
              eastern Mojave, and illuminate the potential regional controls that have tipped
              the scale in favor of gravitational forces leading to extension.  Successful
              outcome of this work will be applicable to other orogens.
