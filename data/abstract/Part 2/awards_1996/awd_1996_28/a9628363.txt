Abstract    :
              9628363  Thurber    This research is to investigate the relationship between 
              earthquakes, of magnitudes about 3.3 and above, to creep events on  the
              Northern Gabilans section of the San Andreas fault (SAF) in  central
              California.  There has been an apparent temporal  relationship between creep
              events and earthquakes on the SAF in  this area from April - November 1995; six
              successive times,  magnitude 3.4 to 5.0 earthquakes were preceded by creep
              events in  the region, with the creep events occurring between 1.5 and 5 days 
              before the earthquakes.  The statistical significance of this  correlation will
              be evaluated as well as related questions of the  physics of earthquakes in
              creeping sections of the SAF.  The  findings may be relevant to the Parkfield
              segment of the SAF and  other creeping fault segments.  This research is a
              component of the  National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
