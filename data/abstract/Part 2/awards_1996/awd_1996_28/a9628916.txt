Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research  Fellowship for 1996. 
              This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of developmental
              biology.  The research and training plan  addresses the sperm components
              required for sperm-oocyte  interactions in C. elegans, an important model
              system used  extensively in studies of normal development.  The project uses
              several genes that when mutated produce  cytologically normal and motile sperm
              that cannot fertilize  oocytes even after contact.  These mutations seem to
              disrupt  either sperm-oocyte recognition, adhesion, or fusion.  Equivalent
              mutants have not been described in any other  metazoan.  The approaches include
              genetic, cell biological,  and molecular biological ones to gain an
              understanding of  these genes and their mutant forms.
