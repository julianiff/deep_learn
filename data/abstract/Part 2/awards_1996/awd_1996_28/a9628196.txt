Abstract    :
              9628196  Peacor    This grant provides $125,000 as one-half support  of the
              costs of acquiring a new scanning electron  microscope system (SEM) for the
              Department of  Geological Sciences at the University of Michigan. 
              Specifically, the SEM will include detectors for  secondary electrons, an
              energy-dispersive X-ray  system for detection of elements with low atomic 
              numbers and the capabilities for back-scattered  electron imaging and image
              digitization and  analysis.  The new instrument will replace an  aging (circa
              1985) Hitachi S-570 SEM that is  plagued with leaking vacuum pumps. poor sample
               stage design and only allows analog capture of  electron images thus
              precluding digital image  analysis which is the state-of-the-art in modern 
              SEM's.  The capabilities of the new SEM to analyze  hydrated samples will allow
              for analyses of  biological materials in addition to geological  samples.  A
              wide range of research will be  conducted with the instrument, including but
              not  limited to, studies of the trace element  geochemistry of hydrothermally
              altered oceanic  rocks, thin film research, metamorphic petrology,  ore deposit
              geochemistry and characterization of  dental materials. It will also benefit
              the  analytical needs of a large community of graduate  and undergraduate
              students.  ***
