Abstract    :
               Fornaess    9628130   Department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan
              will purchase sophisticated graphics equipment, namely, Silicon Graphics
              Indigo2 with the extreme graphics package and the Extreme Graphics System for
              Power Challenge, which will be dedicated to the research in the mathematical
              sciences.    The equipment will be used for several research projects,
              including in particular:  Visualization of two dimensional complex dynamics --
              J.E. Fornaess and E. Gavosto; Simulation, singular-value decomposition, and
              visualization in investigation of multiple-pinhole emission tomographs -- J.
              Aarsvold; Computational study of vortex sheet motion -- R. Krasny;
              Visualization of function theoretic objects -- D. E. Barrett; Interface
              problems using level set methods -- P. Smereka.  The equipment will be placed
              in a Visualization Laboratory, where it will also be available for use by
              graduate students and postdoctoral appointees working on these and related
              projects.
