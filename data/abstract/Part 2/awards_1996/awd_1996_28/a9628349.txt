Abstract    :
              9628349  Berger  Feasibility tests are proposed for a new technology for dating
              volcanic glass shards in source-distal tephra beds.  Optically-stimulated
              luminescence (OSL) offers an alternative and potentially technically simpler
              means for luminescence dating. We propose to investigate the feasibility of
              employing green laser light to stimulate luminescence from glass shards. If
              large signals are observed in several samples, then to G-OSL age determinations
              will be carried out. A selection of 20-30 documented tephra samples will be
              used. Optical dating may be applicable to tephra over 300-400 ka, the present
              limit of TL dating of glass shards.
