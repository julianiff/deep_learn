Abstract    :
              Kirsch, Scott  U. of Colorado, Boulder   From 1957 to 1973, the U.S. Atomic
              Energy Commission (AEC) pursued the `peaceful use of nuclear explosives`
              through Project Plowshare.  Nuclear excavation, the detonation of strategically
              buried hydrogen bombs for massive earthmoving, was considered the most
              promising of the Plowshare applications.  The purpose of the research is to
              investigate the collisions of science, ideology and politics which ultimately
              kept Plowshare designs out of the landscape.  Primary research will emphasize
              AEC-related archival materials which document Plowshare's scientific and
              promotional aims, as well as, the public discourse through which scientific and
              political debates over Plowshare were voiced.  The research will argue that to
              understand processes through which landscapes are made, we must utilize the
              imagined landscapes which fail to take form.  The work incorporates
              contemporary theories of landscape production to untangle the complex relations
              between the accumulation of scientific knowledge and the production of space.
