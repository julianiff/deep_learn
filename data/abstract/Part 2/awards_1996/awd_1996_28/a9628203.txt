Abstract    :
              9628203  Evans  This proposal is to continue work on the thermodynamic
              properties of quadrilateral amphiboles and includes three tasks.  (1) Complete
              the research and manuscript on the dependence of the optical properties of the
              ferromagnesian amphiboles on the composition and ordering states of  natural
              and heat-treated samples. (2) Conduct single crystal XRD refinements on room
              temperature and heat-treated natural gedrites to determine the effects of
              temperature, Fe/Mg, and tschermaks and edenite exchanges on long-range
              ordering. (3) Initial heat-treatment and single-crystal study of natural
              hornblendes from amphibolites. The goal of this project is to calibrate the
              thermodynamic properties of aluminous, calcic and ferromagnesian amphiboles
              with compositions typical of those found in metamorphic and igneous
              assemblages. These properties will allow the PI's to calculate the theoretical
              phase diagrams involving amphiboles and other minerals for which they have
              previously developed internally consistent thermodynamic models. The PI's tend
              to incorporate the models developed in the course of this proposal into the
              software package MELTS, thereby allowing the modeling of amphibole
              crystallization in magmatic and subsolidus systems.
