Abstract    :
                  While existing research shows that reactive congestion control mechanisms 
              are capable of providing high video quality and channel utilization for 
              point-to-point real-time video, there has been relatively little study of  the
              reactive congestion control of point-to-multipoint video, especially in  ATM
              networks.  Problems complicating the provision of multicast,  feedback-based,
              real-time video service include (1) implosion of feedback  returning to the
              source as the number of multicast destinations increases,  and (2) variance in
              the amount of available bandwidth on different branches  in the multipoint
              connection.    The proposed research addresses and solves the two problems
              mentioned above  by introducing and investigating a new service for real-time
              multicast  video.  Multipoint feedback mechanisms are used to adaptively
              control the  transmission rates of each layer of a multi-layered video stream. 
              The  proposed service relies on adaptive, multi-layered coding at the video 
              source and closed-loop feedback from the network in order to control the  high
              and low priority video generation rates of the video encoder.  It also 
              supports a minimum bandwidth guarantee and the best effort support of video 
              traffic exceeding the minimum rate.    To study these mechanisms, mathematical
              analysis, simulations, and  empirical experiments using the ATM testbed network
              available to the P.I.  are employed.
