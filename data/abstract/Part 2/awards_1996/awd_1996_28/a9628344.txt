Abstract    :
              9628344  Arthur     This proposal seeks to resolve a debate as to the intensity
              and depth distribution of oxygen deficiencies in the water column of the Black
              Sea and to provide a test of the efficacy of new techniques for elucidating
              paleoenvironments of ancient "black shales".  Previous workers have suggested,
              on the basis of interpretation of the fabric and geochemical characteristics of
              sediments deposited from about 8 ka to 2 ka, that finely laminated,
              organic-carbon (OC) rich sediments of Unit II, often referred to as sapropels,
              either were deposited under an anoxic water column for which initiation of
              anoxia was time transgressive, beginning earlier in deeper water, or were
              produced under an anoxic water column as the result of high surface-water
              productivity.  New results from the study of Black Sea cores recovered during
              the 1988 R/V Knorr expedition suggest that the onset of water-column anoxia at
              about 7.5 ka was virtually synchronous across the basin over a depth range of
              about 200 m to 2250 m, and that anoxia prevailed throughout deposition of Unit
              II.  However, the concentration, accumulation rate, and degree of preservation
              of organic matter all decreased in the upper part of Unit II, perhaps as a
              result of decreasing productivity and possible erosion of the top of the
              chemocline.  Various redox-sensitive geochemical indicators have been
              interpreted by different workers in contrasting ways.  In the proposed study,
              we will use two new techniques, one involving pyrite (framboid) size
              distributions that constrain the site of pyrite precipitation (water column vs.
              within sediment), and the other a set of organic biomarker compounds indicative
              of the presence of photosynthetic sulfide-oxidizing bacteria in the water
              column.  These techniques will be used in analysis of a depth transect of
              available Black Sea gravity cores that recovered complete sequences of Unit II
              in order to test models of the Holocene evolution of the Black Sea and the
              origin(s) of sediments enriched in organic car bon in general.
