Abstract    :
              9627979  Grand      The PIs propose a collaborative project integrating
              seismological  and geodynamic tools and concepts to elucidate the dynamics and 
              fine structure of the lower mantle and "D" region.  Seismic data  will be used
              to determine details of apparent down- and up-welling,  and contamination from
              shallow earth structures will be elucidated  by the interplay between direct
              seismic modeling and prediction  made from dynamic models.  Dynamic models will
              be used to construct  2D and 3D velocity models which in turn will be used to
              construct  synthetics, and their predictions will be compared with appropriate 
              data sets for verification and feed-back to produce improved  models.  Recent
              tomographic models will be used to construct 2D  cross-sections and
              corresponding synthetics in year one, and fully  dynamic models will be used to
              study thermochemical boundaries in  hot regions where partial melting or
              entrainment of core material  could play a role in a year two.    ***
