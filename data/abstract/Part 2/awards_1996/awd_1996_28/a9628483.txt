Abstract    :
              9628483  Hallgren     This award provides travel support for graduate students,
              post-doctoral scholars, and invited speakers who will participate in a special
              workshop on computer intensive statistical techniques and their application to
              the atmospheric sciences.  The workshop will be held just prior to the American
              Meteorological Society's 13th Conference on Probability and Statistics in San
              Francisco in February 1996.  The workshop has two goals:  (1) to improve and
              promote stronger interaction between the statistics and atmospheric sciences
              communities and (2) to introduce graduate students and postdoctoral scholars
              both to the latest statistical concepts relevant to the atmospheric sciences
              and to the statisticians responsible for those developments.  The workshop
              papers and discussions will be published in a monograph that will be widely
              distributed.     Support for this award will be shared between the programs in
              the Lower Atmospheric Research Section of the Division of Atmospheric Sciences
              and the Statistics and Probability Program of the Division of Mathematical
              Sciences.
