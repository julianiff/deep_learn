Abstract    :
              The primary objective of this proposal is to determine how mycorrhizal fungi
              recolonize the roots of host pine species following fire.  The fungi are
              essential to the health and growth of all trees in the pine family, yet little
              is currently know about how they survive and re-establish themselves after
              fire.  Most of the research will be conducted at Pt. Reyes National Seashore in
              naturally regenerating Bishop pine forests.  Study sites were selected to take
              advantage of the recent 5100 hectare wildfire which included several areas
              where the pre-fire symbiotic fungal community was know in detail.  Specific
              questions to be addressed include:  1) What is the dominant source of post-fire
              fungi?  2) How is fungal species composition affected by differences in ash
              deposition, tree mortality, and litter removal?  and 3) What effect does fungal
              inoculum level have on successful seedling establishment?    An increased
              understanding of the dynamics of mycorrhizal populations should have important
              implications for our understanding of forest dynamics and reforestation
              practices.
