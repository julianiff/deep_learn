Abstract    :
              HRD-9628724  Cal State LA University Auxiliary    "Protein Biochemistry"    This
              program will establish a protein analysis and purification  facility which will
              b used to gain a better understanding of the  mechanisms of action proteins and
              enzymes, and the biochemical  processes that regulate their cellular
              concentrations and/or  activities.  The biochemical interactions and enzymatic
              kinetics of  highly purified proteins that have been altered either chemically 
              or by site-directed mutagenesis will be studied to understand their  mechanism
              of action.  Also, the concentrations of proteins before  and after a
              nutritional or physiological change will be quantified  to elucidate the
              biochemical mechanisms that regulate their levels  within an organism.  The
              titles of the research projects are   "Regulation of Apolipoprotein A-1
              Concentrations in Rabbit High  Density Lipoproteins by Dietary Cholesterol and
              Jojoba Oil",  "Synthesis and Analysis of Transition Metal Modified Peptides and
               Proteins", "Mapping the Allosteric Activator Site of  Phosphoenolpyruvate
              Carboxylase by Site-Directed Mutagenesis", and  "The Role of Enzymatic
              Oxidative Defenses in Arabidopsis Leaf  Senescence".    The program will
              involve five to ten students from minority groups  underrepresented in the
              sciences, specifically, African Americans,  Hispanics, and Native  Americans,
              with the objective of preparing  them for graduate school and research careers
              in biochemistry.   Activities will include research training and presentations
              at  scientific meetings, as well as seminars, and academic and career 
              counseling.  ***
