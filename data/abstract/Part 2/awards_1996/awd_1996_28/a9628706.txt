Abstract    :
                The investigators will study the electrodynamic coupling between  the solar
              wind, the Earth's magnetosphere, and the ionosphere.   Initial focus will be on
              comparison of the magnetometer and  incoherent scatter radar data for studying
              cusp/cleft dynamics  behavior in response to variations in the solar wind and 
              interplanetary magnetic field.  Fundamental questions center around  the
              identification of ionospheric signatures of phenomena which  occur at the
              magnetopause and which relate to solar wind-  magnetosphere interactions. 
              Later studies will focus on the  magnetometer and radar data comparison with
              satellite images.   Finally, the investigators will undertake extensive
              modeling of  ionospheric phenomena through the 3-D adaptive grid MHD model and 
              empirical ionospheric electrodynamic model developed at the  University of
              Michigan.  The former model has the ability to  resolve features over vastly
              different spatial scales making the  ionospheric predictions meaningful and,
              therefore, appropriate for  comparisons with measurements and numerical
              modeling of other  iuonospheric electrodynamic parameters.
