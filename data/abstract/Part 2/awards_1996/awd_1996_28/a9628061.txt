Abstract    :
                The goal of this proposed research is to investigate genetic and molecular
              mechanisms underlying plant embryo development by characterizing
              embryo-defective (emb) mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana. Emphasis is on the
              characterization of the twn1 mutant, which is disrupted in embryonic
              morphogenesis and maintenance of cell type in the suspensor, and on emb88, a
              T-DNA insertion mutant that exhibits abnormal cell organization and arrested
              morphogenesis. Specific goals with twn1 include: 1) constructing double mutant
              lines with Arabidopsis mutants that have altered levels or sensitivity to plant
              growth regulators, and 2) characterizing the pleiotropic effects of the twn1
              mutation on post embryonic development. These studies should provide insight
              into the function  of the wild type TWN1 gene, and elucidate the mechanism of
              the dramatic embryogenic transformation observed in the mutant twn1 suspensor.
              Specific goals with emb88 include completing characterization of the EMB88
              genomic locus and isolation of the EMB88 cDNA. This work should elucidate the
              biochemical function of the EMB88 gene product, and provide the foundation for
              a long term molecular study of the role of this gene in Arabidopsis
              embryogenesis. Molecular information on emb88 will have an impact on our
              understanding of Arabidopsis embryogenesis and emb mutants, because to date
              only a handful of Arabidopsis embryo mutants have been characterized at the
              molecular level. Together, twn1 and emb88 should yield valuable information on
              key processes of plant embryogenesis, including morphogenesis, maintenance of
              differentiated cell type, and intercellular communication in the developing
              embryo.
