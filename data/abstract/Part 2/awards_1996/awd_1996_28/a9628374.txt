Abstract    :
              9628374  Varekamp  This conference, which is organized as a Chapman conference
              under AGU stewardship will bring together scientists that work on volcanic
              degassing, crater lakes, economic geochemists, geothermal geologists and
              environmental chemists.  All share research either in active volcanic terrains
              or through their dealings with the chemistry of hyper-acid fluids in the
              environment.  Exchange of data, methods and factual knowledge between those
              different constituencies will be fruitful for future research.  Funding will
              provide  support to graduate students from universities in the USA to attend
              this meeting.
