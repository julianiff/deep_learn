Abstract    :
              The overall objective of the project is to identify sets of core competencies
              and skills in mathematics, science, engineering and technology that are
              required by industries that hire two-year college graduates with technical
              degrees.  the project will investigate 5 technology based industries, interview
              technicians and supervisors in five companies in each of these industries, and
              also interview a sample of graduates of community colleges.  the project will
              produce research papers on the measurement of the integration of community
              college curriculum with industrial needs and will provide a basis for future
              study of technical education.  It will provide some of the first detailed
              workplace ethnography's of the use of mathematics and science in industrial
              jobs of technicians.  No other study of colleges  has developed a similar
              curriculum study of community colleges and a match with industrial uses of
              those graduates.
