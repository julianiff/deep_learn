Abstract    :
              DMI-9628984  Sutherland  This effort is focused on research related to
              environmental issues associated with machining processes.  The research
              emphasizes characterizing the role of cutting fluids in machining with the goal
              of fluid reduction/elimination.  In order to eliminate, or in the short term
              reduce the environmental impact of cutting fluids, a better understanding of
              the role and function of cutting fluids is required, including the effects of
              fluid concentration, flow rate, pressure, and point of application.  One
              negative aspect of cutting fluid use is mist formation.  Research to
              characterize the mechanisms associated with mist formation is being undertaken.
               The effects of cutting fluids in terms of heat transfer and lubrication are
              also being examined.  A teaching effort is also underway that includes the
              development of courses in environmentally conscious manufacturing.
