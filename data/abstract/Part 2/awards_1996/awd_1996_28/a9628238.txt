Abstract    :
              9628238  Lasaga  This project is a continuation of theoretical and experimental
              work on the atomic description of geochemical processes and the development of
              kinetic theory in geochemistry.  particular emphasis is placed on advancing the
              molecular theory of water-rock kinetics including effects of solution
              composition, temperature, pH, and inorganic molecules.  This project will also
              study the bonding and energetics related to hydration and complex formation of
              silicon, aluminum and metals in solution.  A new Monte Carlo program is being
              developed that incorporates the details of the mineral structure directly in
              models of the dissolution and growth of minerals.  These Monte Carlo
              simulations will provide a linkage between the atomic level results of ab
              initio and the observables of the experiments.
