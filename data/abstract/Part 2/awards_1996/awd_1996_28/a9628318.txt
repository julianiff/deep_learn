Abstract    :
              9628318  Romanowicz      This grant provides $199,628 as partial support of  the
              costs of acquiring strong motion and broadband  seismic sensors, Quanterra data
              loggers, GPS  receivers and frame-relay equipment to complement  newly acquired
              (EAR-9512212) continuous GPS  receivers that have been deployed in northern 
              California as part of the Bay Area Deformation  Network (BARD).  The frame
              relay and seismic  equipment will allow continuous and real-time  monitoring of
              strain release associated with  hazardous faults in the Bay area and real-time 
              estimates of finite fault parameters in damaging  earthquakes.  Instruments
              will be installed at  four sites in the BARD network.  This equipment  will
              allow the group at the Berkeley Seismographic  Station to continue both seismic
              monitoring in the  heavily populated Bay Area and fundamental  research
              including studies of seismic attenuation  in the upper mantle and modeling of
              crustal  structure and the distribution of strong ground  motions following
              large earthquakes.  The  acquisition of seismic data in real-time or near 
              real-time should be of fundamental importance for  future contributions to
              seismic hazard mitigation.  ***
