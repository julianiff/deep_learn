Abstract    :
              9628304  Brandon       This  actions provides partial support for a Penrose 
              conference, "Exhumation Processes:  normal faulting, Ductile  flow, and 
              Erosion" to be held in Crete, October 9-12, 1996.  The conference will examine
              the timely subject of how  exhumation processes operate to bring deep-seated
              rocks to  the surface.  Results are expected to review this subject  and
              synthesize present knowledge in order to provide a focus  for future research
              in the area.
