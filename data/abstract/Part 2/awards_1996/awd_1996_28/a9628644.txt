Abstract    :
              Johnson  9628644  The PIs propose to investigate the viscous properties of the
              crust by extending geodetic measurements made from 1969 through 1987 in the
              area of the 1968 Borrego Mountain earthquake (M=6.5).  The PIs will collect an
              additional set of GPS observations in the area, and will use the resulting
              28-year span of these measurements to determine the time-dependence in strain
              rate caused by fault afterslip and inelastic crustal rheology.  This research
              will provide new data essential for the analysis of crustal viscosity and its
              relation to earthquake deformation.
