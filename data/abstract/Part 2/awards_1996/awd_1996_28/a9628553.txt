Abstract    :
              9628553  Jansma    This grant provides $25,000 as one-half support of  the costs
              of acquiring two dual-frequency GPS  receivers and a workstation to be used for
               tectonic research, monitoring for hazard  mitigation and for educational
              purposes.  Specific  projects to be undertaken will include examination  of the
              strain partitioning within the Caribbean-  North American plate boundary and
              its implications  for seismic hazards in Puerto Rico and measurement  of
              surface deformation associated with dome growth  and/or magma chamber inflation
              in the currently  active Soufriere Hills volcanic center on the  island of
              Montserrat, West Indies.  ***
