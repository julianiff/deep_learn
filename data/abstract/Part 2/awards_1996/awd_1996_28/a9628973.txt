Abstract    :
              9628973  Bhattacharya  There is a need for long wavelength, or terahertz,
              sources for a variety of  applications. In general such sources have been
              realized with small bandgap  semiconductors and more recently with intersubband
              transitions in quantum  wells. In general, if intra-band population inversion
              is to be created in a  quantum well by carrier injection at the barrier energy,
              it is necessary  that the electron intra-band energy relaxation times are long.
              Additionally  the bandedge electron-hole recombination times should be short.
              The use of  sub-2 dimensional structures (quantum dots) allows us to increase
              the  intra-band energy relaxation time from about a picosecond for bulk or 
              quasi-2 dimensional systems to several hundred picoseconds at room 
              temperatures. Furthermore, by placing these structures in a high coherent 
              photon density optical cavity, it is possible to decrease the bandedge 
              electron-hole recombination times through stimulated emission. Our  theoretical
              studies show that strong population inversion and gain are  possible at room
              temperature with such systems. We will carry out careful  experimental studies
              to fabricate quantum dot structures to realize these  concepts. We have already
              demonstrated the fabrication of buried quantum  dot waveguide structures. We
              expect the devices to produce radiation in the  range of 10^13 to 10^14 Hz.
