Abstract    :
              Hughes, Philip  AST 96-17032    Dr. Hughes will study the dynamics of
              relativistic  astrophysical flows and compute the radiative properties of  such
              flows for comparison with single-dish and Very Long  Baseline Interferometry
              data.  The work will center around  existing code which will be improved and
              extended.  The  goals of the study are to explore the propagation of shocks  in
              curved flows, to address whether shocks arise from  feedback between flow and
              cocoon or from near the central  engine, to determine whether shocks have
              structure thin  enough to explain observed variability, to establish  realistic
              parameterizations of the velocity and density  field of flows, and to infer
              flow patterns of observed jets  to discriminate between central engine models.
