Abstract    :
                This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of
              NCRI's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers K-12
              education institutions (including vocational technical schools), public
              libraries and museums.  It provides partial support for two years to connect a
              small rural school district to the Internet.  The wireless connection allows
              substantially lower cost Internet access through a neighboring telephone
              company than from the larger telephone company serving the district.
