Abstract    :
              This study will examine the origins and population affinities of the aboriginal
              populations of Australia and New Guinea by use of three different genetic
              systems:  mitochondrial DNA, human leucocyte antigen genes, and short tandem
              repeat markers on the Y chromosome.  Specific aims of the project include 1)
              clarification of biological and historical relationships between Australian and
              New Guinean populations,  2) testing for single or multiple episodes of
              migration to Sahul (the Pleistocene continent that included Australia, New
              guinea, and Tasmania),  3) identifying possible sources and routes for the
              migration into Sahul, and  4) testing the concordance of the three genetic
              systems in reconstructing population histories.  Genetic analyses will involve
              system specific considerations such as differences in inheritance pattern,
              effective population size, and mutation rates.  Phylogenetic, population
              subdivision, and demographic expansion analyses of the data from these three
              genetic systems will provide rich insights into the genetic history of the
              occupation of Sahul.
