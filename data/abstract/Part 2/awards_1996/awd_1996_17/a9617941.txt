Abstract    :
                Huggins, Patrick  AST  96-17941    Dr. Huggins continues his research on the
              latest stages of stellar evolution in low and   intermediate mass stars - the
              transition from the AGB phase to white dwarfs and the formation of   planetary
              nebulae.  He uses a wide variety of observational techniques, including
              infrared   spectro-imaging, millimeter interferometry, and millimeter and
              sub-millimeter single disk   observations to study a sample of objects covering
              different stages of evolution from precursor   proto-planetaries to highly
              evolved nebulae. Using the molecular and atomic line emission from   the
              neutral shells around these objects, Dr. Huggins will investigate the shell
              dynamics, velocity   field, geometry, and properties of the gas, to develop a
              detailed picture of the evolution of the   neutral shells and the formation of
              planetary nebulae.   ***
