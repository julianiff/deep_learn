Abstract    :
                Bacteria are thought to be second only to phytoplankton in the role living
              organisms contribute to the transformation of organic carbon in aquatic
              ecosystems. In open ocean waters, the biomass of living bacteria has been
              reported to exceed that of all other living plankton, and even in continental
              shelf and coastal waters it is significant. However, these estimates are all
              derived from the assumption that all DAPI stained cells are metabolically
              active cells. This hypothesis no longer appears tenable: a large fraction of
              apparent bacteria are apparently inactive, moribund, or dead. Such a conclusion
              threatens to precipitate another paradigm shift in conceptual models of
              ecosystem function. At the very least, it would imply that a comparatively few
              bacteria in situ are growing (and respiring) much faster than previously
              thought, and that a large fraction of `apparent` bacteria is really a component
              of detritus.  We have developed a novel combination of a fluorescent Vital
              Stain and molecular Probes (VSP) which quantitatively identifies those cells
              with compromised membranes, and those cells containing sufficient rRNA to be
              considered metabolically active. While neither approach alone might be
              considered adequate to specify active from inactive, moribund, or dead cells,
              together they potentially comprise a powerful tool to investigate the relative
              importance of these cell types in situ, and how they change in response to
              environmental pressures. We have already demonstrated the validity of the VSP
              procedure using E. coli,  here we will examine its applicability to marine Gram
              positive, Gram negative, and oligophiles. We will then test the accuracy of the
              VSP to quantify living, non living, and starved cells in response to nutrients
              and viruses, and begin to document patterns of living and non living cells in
              natural communities. There is also promise of determining the numerical
              importance of inactive but living cells. The results will not only provide a
              stringent evaluation of the method for use in the marine environment, but the
              field data on active cells vs. those with compromised membranes will provide
              the first quantitative basis for a revised conceptual model of the role of
              bacteria in transformations between DOC, detritus, and bacteria.    +n ±! ?n ¼f
