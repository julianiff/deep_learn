              Instrumentation: A Study of an Event Based and Feature Based Approach to Speech
              Recognition     The aims of this study are to develop a speech recognition
              system based on phonetic features and to use the development of this system as
              a tool for understanding variability.  Relative to cepstral parameters,
              broad-class recognition results show that a signal representation based on
              phonetic features is better able to target the linguistic information and it
              does so in a more speaker-independent manner.  Furthermore, such a signal
              representation allows for a direct study of phonological processes.  The
              proposed equipment will help extend this work. First, the drastic cut in
              computation time afforded by the Ultra 2- will  speed up the development and
              optimization of acoustic parameters using the Fisher criterion and an automatic
              classifier, - make feasible experimentation with a full object-oriented
              lexicon,- allow experimentation with computationally expensive algorithms for
              the extraction of acoustic events and -allow faster computation of recognition
              results.  Second, the extra disks will allow investigation of larger data sets
              and the storage of computed parameters on line.  Third, the workstations will
              aid analysis by allowing users to listen to utterances and perform processing
              locally.  Finally, the proposed PC and synthesizer will allow a study of
              variability through acoustic modeling and analysis-by-synthesis.
