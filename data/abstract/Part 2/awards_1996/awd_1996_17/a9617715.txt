Abstract    :
              9617715  Markle    This is a pilot study to develop a series of software tools
              and instructional materials to test the concept of delivering instructional
              packets for grades 3-5 through the Internet. The materials are to be
              highly-interactive, thematic activities to encourage collaborative problem
              solving. The student materials will be accompanied by on-line teacher
              professional development, support materials, and special activities to
              encourage parents to become partners in the education process. The project
              proposes to develop a model for how to exploit the capabilities of new
              technologies and access to the Internet for science education. The themes in
              the materials will align closely with NSES. If successful, the project will
              seek support to develop a comprehensive program of Internet-based instructional
              materials in science for grades 3-5
