Abstract    :
              BENNING  DEB-9617453    The structure of landscape diversity on Mauna Loa
              volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii is made to order for determining some of
              the functional consequences of landscape heterogeneity.  This project will
              examine the role of edges in ecosystem development in wet tropical rainforest
              in Hawaii.  Mechanisms of edge formation and propagation will also be examined.
               This project will employ process level field measurements, analysis of remote
              sensing data and GIS modelling to document and explicitly link landscape scale
              pattern to ecosystem functioning.
