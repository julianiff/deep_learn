Abstract    :
              Understanding individual differences in behavior has always been troublesome for
              many social science methodologies.  Such differences often are well modeled by
              latent class methodology viewed from the perspective of finite mixture theory. 
              One impediment to application of mixture models has been the general
              inaccessibility of such models for the general research community.  A more
              serious conceptual problem, however, is that the form of component
              distributions must be specified a priori, and there is typically no theory to
              guide this selection, especially in exploratory settings where their use could
              be most revealing.  This research focuses on the development and extension of a
              binomial mixture model as a solution to this problem.  The investigator will
              conduct both Monte Carlo and analytical work.  The model has applications both
              in survey research and in substantive areas such as developmental psychology.
