Abstract    :
              This dissertation project investigates the relationship between technology and
              culture by examining the development and transfer of electronic automatic
              control technology between the United States and Japan in the period of
              1920-1965.  Although Japanese business imported large quantities of control
              technology from America during the 1920's, the material, managerial, and
              scientific circumstances under which engineers used these technologies differed
              substantially between Japan and the United States.  Different conditions
              produced different technologies appropriate to these societies' technological
              capabilities.  In addition, in each country industrialists, bureaucrats, and
              academics created distinctive interpretations of control suitable to their
              particular social, cultural, and political situations.  This study will use
              control technology as a vehicle for understanding the material and
              sociocultural transformations necessary to move technologies between societies.
               The central hypothesis is that for imported technology to be useful, its
              recipients must reorganize and adapt it to suit their particular needs.  At the
              same time, however, the recipients must reevaluate the technology in light of
              its new role in their society, creating a new set of meanings that define the
              terms under which the technology will be applied.  In so doing, the users
              transform their relationships to themselves, to each other, and to the
              technology itself.
