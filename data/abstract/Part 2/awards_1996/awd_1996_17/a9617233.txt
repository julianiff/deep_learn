Abstract    :
              The Carnegie-Rochester Conference on Public Policy is designed to foster
              research and discussion of major policy issues by economists from academia and
              various policymaking organizations. Economists in universities are often
              unfamiliar with the constraining effect of institutional arrangements in the
              shaping of policy issues whereas economists in government are often less aware
              of current research developments and their implications. The principal
              objectives of the conference series are (i) to stimulate policy relevance in
              theoretical and empirical research in economic sciences, (ii) to encourage
              interchange of scientific ideas among analysts with different approaches, and
              (iii) to generate greater understanding by academic economists of
              practitioners' environments. The conferences have been outstandingly productive
              along these lines in the past and recent adjustments in procedures that have
              been designed to assure that they will continue to be productive in the future.
              The conferences are held semiannually at Carnegie Mellon University and the
              University of Rochester. About 50 participants plus faculty and graduate
              students from the host institution are invited to each conference. Participants
              from U.S. and foreign central banks and U.S. and international agencies attend
              regularly, and special care is taken to involve promising young scholars. The
              papers and formal discussions are edited and published so as to broaden the
              impact of the conference.
