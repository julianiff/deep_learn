Abstract    :
              9617793  Zhou    Decentralized trading raises three important questions.  First,
              how can mutual gains to trade among a large group of agents be realized when
              the only direct meetings between agents are in small groups, e.g., pairs?  In
              other words, how can the lack of double coincidence of wants be overcome in a
              decentralized trading environment?  Second, how can uniform terms of trade be
              established and maintained among these trading coalitions that only communicate
              indirectly with one another, and can the uniformity be exact or only
              approximate?  Third, are there other non-uniform patterns of trade that could
              be equilibria, and how do they compare to the uniform terms of trade in
              efficiency?  Kiyotaki and Wright initiated a research program that has made
              great progress in addressing the first question.  Their model makes simplifying
              assumptions that trivialize the other two questions, though.  This project
              analyzes a generalization of their model that permits all three questions to be
              addressed in an integrated framework.
