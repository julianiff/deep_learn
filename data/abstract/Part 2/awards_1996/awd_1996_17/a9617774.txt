Abstract    :
              This starter grant award to Kansas State University supports the research of
              Professor Daniel A. Higgins.   The research focusses on the fundamental
              physical and chemical properties of mesostructured materials  as studied by
              near-field scanning optical microscopy.  Thin films of polymer-dispersed
              electrochromic  materials including phthalocyanin-based materials are studied. 
              Film morphology is characterized and its  effects on local organization of the
              electrochromic molecules are elucidated.  Since local properties of  these
              inherently mesostructured films are dramatically different from their average
              properties, the research  promises to provide a better understanding of these
              and other highly structured materials.    From a technological perspective,
              polymer-dispersed materials are being developed for diverse  applications in
              optics, display, detector, and data storage technologies, as well as in
              catalysis.  The  research contributes to the advancement of these technologies.
