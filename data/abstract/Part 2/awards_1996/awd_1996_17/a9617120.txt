Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of
              the Chemistry Division, Devlin will continue studies on characterizing   the
              structure of ice surfaces and adsorbates using spectroscopic   techniques in
              order to provide a detailed picture of the structural and   dynamical
              interactions between them.  FTIR measurements will be used to   examine the
              ability to form stable nanoparticle assemblies of crystalline   ice and other
              molecular solids at cryogenic temperatures.  Another aspect   of the proposal
              involves theoretical modeling of the properties of ice,   particularly those
              related to the measurements.  The nature and effect of   hydrogen-bonding
              molecules such as HCN, NH3, ethylene oxide, HCl, and H2S   with the surface and
              subsurface will be examined.  A study of the   mobility of water molecules near
              the surface and an extension of these   studies to other molecular substances,
              including binary mixtures with   alcohols, acids, and the like, will be
              undertaken.  This project entails in part a fundamental laboratory study of
              processes   which take place on ice surfaces, many of which are involved in
              natural   phenomena of considerable current interest.  Among these are the  
              environmentally urgent issues of the formation of the ozone hole, acid   rain,
              and smog.  In addition, these experiments will help elucidate such   areas of
              astrophysical interest as the mechanism of the formation of   molecules in
              interstellar space and the composition of cometary tails.
