Abstract    :
              9617929  McManus    This project will examine the effects of early diagenesis
              upon two  elements (Ba and P) often used as tracers for past ocean  production.
              The PIs hypothesize that Ba preservation is related to  the degree of oxygen
              penetration into the sediment, and propose to  use a redox sensitive element
              such as U as an independent tracer of  sediment oxidation state. P preservation
              is hypothesized to be  dependent upon both sediment oxidation and the presence
              of Fe  oxides. The PIs will collect solid and fluid phases in sediment  cores
              from the southeast Pacific and Chile continental margin  spanning a wide range
              of oxidation states and sediment types.  Species to be analyzed include Ba, P,
              U, Cd, SO4, C1, F, Mn, Fe,  PO4, NH4, NO3 and O2.
