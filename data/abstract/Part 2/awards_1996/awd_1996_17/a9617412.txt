Abstract    :
                Abstract  9617412  Besson  Electromagnetic radiation (light, x-rays, gamma
              rays, etc.) cannot escape from inside the most active regions of the universe,
              for instance from the nuclei of galaxies, nor can the highest energy gamma rays
              even propagate through intergalactic space because they will be absorbed by the
              cosmic background infrared photons.  Neutrinos, however, can traverse a
              considerable amount of material unimpeded, and if they can be detected in such
              a way that their arrival direction and energy can be determined, they can be
              used to study high density regions and highest energy events of the cosmos. 
              When an electron type neutrino does interact in a dielectric medium (such as
              the deep glacial ice beneath South Pole) it will produce a shower of electron
              and positrons which will rapidly radiate away the energy of the original
              neutrino as electromagnetic radiation.  The probability of such interactions
              increases with increasing energy, so that a detector's sensitivity increases
              with energy.  Thus, a modest (by neutrino detector standards) sized
              instrumented volume of ice, say a 100 meter cube, could have an effective
              volume of a cubic kilometer, a size which is deemed necessary to do astronomy. 
              This is a pilot project to determine the feasibility of the radio detection of
              neutrino interactions in ice.  ***
