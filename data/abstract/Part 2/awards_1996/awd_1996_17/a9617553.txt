Abstract    :
              9617553  Wells  This proposal is on research to test the hypothesis that matrix-
               associated ligands for growth factor receptors stimulate cell  migration in a
              fashion that depends on both ligand concentration  and proximity to ligands for
              adhesion receptors.  This research  involves collaborative research between
              investigators at two  academic institutions, MIT and the University of Alabama
              at  Birmingham.  This collaboration enables the investigators to  combine their
              expertise in cell and molecular biology and  biomaterials, tissue engineering,
              and quantitative analysis in  order to develop a unique model system in which
              both cellular  parameters (receptor type, receptor signaling responses) and 
              environmental parameters (number, type, and nanoscale control of  spatial
              presentation of ligands for adhesion and growth factor  receptors) can be
              independently and systematically modulated.  The experimental system will be
              complimented by rigorous  quantitative analysis of the receptor-mediated
              processes which  occur.  This will provide a basis for choosing the most 
              appropriate range of system parameters to study experimentally  and which
              allows the results of studies in the model system to be  generalized to
              additional cell types important in tissue  engineering.  ***
