Abstract    :
              Boynton  9617977    A World in Motion II: The Design Experience engages students
              in authentic engineering design challenges that are the context for learning
              mathematics, science, technology, education, social science, and language arts
              concepts and skills appropriate to middle school students.  This project is
              based on the engineering design experiences for seventh and eighth grades. It
              provides support for teachers in their understanding of the design experience
              and of learning goals for students.  The materials include short papers, how-to
              instructions, assessment items, and videos demonstrating classroom experiences,
              technical instructions and assembly of materials. In addition a sixth grade
              challenge that can be used in stand alone classrooms or in team situations
              provides a bridge from World in Motion I to the engineering design experience. 
              The evaluation provides data demonstrating the effectiveness of the materials.
