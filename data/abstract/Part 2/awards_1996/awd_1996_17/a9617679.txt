Abstract    :
              9617679  Lacy    A substantial body of research on mass political behavior
              assumes that individuals have "separable preferences."  This assumption
              requires that a person's preference on one issue does not depend on preference
              on other issues.  The assumption is so prevalent that public opinion surveys
              typically ask a respondent her opinion on one issue after another without links
              across issues.  What if a persons wants the federal government to prohibit
              abortions, but only if the government also increases spending on sexual
              education, public day care, and aid to families with dependent children?  Or
              what if a person wants a tax cut only if spending cuts come from the defense
              budget, not from social welfare?  If a person's opinion on one issue depends on
              the outcome of or the options available on another issue, her preferences are
              "nonseparable."    This project investigates the extent and impact of
              nonseparable preferences in public opinion and voting behavior.  Small-group
              experiments assist the principal investigator in formulating new survey
              questions to determine the impact nonseparable preferences have on survey
              responses.  The investigator uses new survey questions in a random sample
              telephone survey of 400 residents of Columbus, Ohio.  Data from the survey
              enables social scientists to judge whether nonseparable preferences explain
              some common empirical problems in public opinion, including question-order
              effects, over-time instability in preferences, and the apparently minimal
              impact of issues on voter choice in elections.  With new survey instruments
              available to capture nonseparable preferences, political scientists are better
              equipped to investigate voting behavior and public opinion, and policymakers
              have a clearer view of what people actually want on important public policy
              issues.  ***
