Abstract    :
              9617477  Rinaldi    In this grant, two- and three-dimensional nuclear magnetic 
              resonance (NMR) triple techniques (together with isotropic  labeling in some
              cases) are being used to study problems in  polymer structure, polymer
              formation and degradation  mechanisms, and polymer reactivity.  Methods which
              have been  used for years in structural biology are being adapted for 
              application in polymer science and new methods are being  developed which are
              uniquely suited for the study of  polymers.  These methods allow selective
              probing of the  structure and transformations which occur in one small part  of
              a large molecule without interference from the signals  from the rest of the
              molecule.  %%%  These techniques are being used to study the structure of 
              polymer block junctions, polymer chain ends and defects, and  the mechanisms of
              various polymer reactions.  A knowledge of  these structures provides valuable
              insight into polymer  formation and stability.  The materials being studied are
               important for the manufacture of rubber products, plastics,  semiconductors,
              and biomedical engineering materials.  ***
