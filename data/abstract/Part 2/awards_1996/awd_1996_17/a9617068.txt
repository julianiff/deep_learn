Abstract    :
                This study proposes to utilize new molecular approaches to recover, amplify,
              and sequence DNA from dense deposits of permafrost remains in Alaska and the
              Yukon which represent unique samples of the faunal inhabitants of the area over
              the past 40,000 years.  The PIs propose a small, innovate and experimental
              approach which has a high possibility of obtaining data that can address long
              standing questions in polar biology including population movements,
              extinctions, and biotic adaptations.  The basic research techniques involve
              using ancient DNA techniques to extract and characterize preserved DNA in
              permafrost stabilized specimens.
