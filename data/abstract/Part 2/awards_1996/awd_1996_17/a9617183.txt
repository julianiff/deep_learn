Abstract    :
              9617183  Horwath  Recently, proteinaceous antifreezes, once thought to be an
              adaptation restricted to polar fishes and overwintering terrestrial insect,
              have been found among much broader phylogenetcally diverse groups of both plant
              and animal species.  Yet, despite the now numerous examples of their role in
              survival of subzero temperatures, very little is known about the cellular
              mechanisms regulating production.  This study will use a newly developed cell
              culture system derived from the beetle, Tenebrio molitor, to begin for the
              first time a more direct assessment of environmental, hormonal, and cellular
              mechanisms influencing production, storage and secretion of a specific insect
              antifreeze protein.  This is possible because this in vitro system allows one
              to track and quantitate specific antifreezes from their biosynthesis,
              throughout their trafficking within the cell, through to secretion into the
              blood, using sensitive and specific biochemical, immunological, and computer
              imaging tools.  In addition, molecular studies that have recently resulted in
              cloning of a specific insect antifreeze gene, will be expanded to obtain more
              molecular characterization of this gene and other possible homologues.  Thus,
              through a combination of in vitro and molecular approaches, this project will
              do much to unravel the cellular and genetic mechanisms contributing to
              antifreeze activity and thus effective cold hardening, and should lead to
              practical cryobiological applications.
