Abstract    :
              This project focuses on some important statistical issues relating to the
              problem of estimating regressions curves that are known or required to satisfy
              certain constraints such as monotonicity, convexity, periodicity, or range
              bounds.  These constraints arise in a variety of social, economic, biometric,
              and behavioral applications.  Despite a vast amount of literature on function
              estimation, few algorithms are available for incorporating constraints.  This
              project starts with a simple and effective method based on L1 optimization in
              the space of B-splines.  The asymptotic properties, modeling flexibility, and
              computational complexity of the method are about the same as those of the
              unconstrained problems.  The investigator will extend work on the method to
              include adaptive choice of dimension for the spline space, hypothesis testing
              on constraints, handling of binary response, semiparametric models and
              multivariate functions, and computation of properly ordered percentile curves. 
              In addition to the methodological research, a user-friendly software for
              constrained B-spline smoothing will be developed through collaborations.
