Abstract    :
                Churchwell, Edward B.  AST  96-17686    Dr. Churchwell will study the
              formation processes and early  evolution of massive stars in our  Galaxy using
              a variety of observational techniques in the  radio and infrared.  His research
               program focuses on a study of the environment of ultra  compact HII regions,
              the earliest  manifestations of high mass stars.  He will use observations  of
              molecular lines in the radio and  the infrared to investigate the velocity
              structure,  chemistry, energetics, and physical conditions in  the gas near
              these stars.  He is particularly interested in  understanding the properties of
              molecular  outflows and the accompanying accretion disks believed to be 
              associated with young massive  stars during their formation.  ***
