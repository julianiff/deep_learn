Abstract    :
              9617369  Harvey    The Education Development Center is developing mathematics
              curriculum materials for the last two years of high school that complement the
              emerging NSF comprehensive secondary curricula, that supplement existing high
              school curricula, and that provide a method of transition from traditional
              curricula to standards-based programs.  The materials include modules for
              students and support materials for teachers and feature: attention to the
              concerns of postsecondary education and the workplace; a modular design that
              allows many configurations to meet different needs; an emphasis on helping
              students develop mathematical ways of thinking; an integration of continuous
              and discrete topics, stressing connections among them; and teacher guides, a
              course organization guide, and an implementation guide.
