Abstract    :
              9617698  Chang    The study of materials science and technology is inherently
              interdisciplinary, organizing the study of chemistry, physics, biology,
              technology and mathematics about problems rather than as separate disconnected
              disciplines.  Six modules have been developed that apply important concepts in
              science and mathematics to the properties and use of materials. This project is
              to add assessments to the modules and subject them to extensive field testing
              to gather data about student achievement of important learning goals.  The
              teacher materials provide information about the design process and addressing
              the learning goals.  Two more modules on Materials and Environment and Sports
              Materials are developed and tested.  All of the modules are indexed to
              comprehensive curriculum materials in the disciplines. The project develops
              kits, interactive CDROM with databases, and support for teachers both on-line
              and through organizations, as well as print modules and teacher materials.
