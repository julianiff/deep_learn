Abstract    :
              9617576  Jones    This project renews researah on the aggregate effects and
              equilibrium selection of public policies begun under a previous NSF award.  The
              first part of the project examines the relationship between the structure of
              information, i.e., differences in the information acquired by buyers and
              sellers, and the effect of  monetary policy variability on economic
              performance.  This new dimension of monetary policy is shown to have important
              and predictable effects.  This work is extended to dynamic settings with
              production and inventory decisions.  Preliminary results suggest that existing
              models of the welfare costs of inflation will substantially underestimate its
              costs when variability is high.  The second part examines how collective
              decision making mechanisms fare in terms of policy choice.  It explores the
              implications for the data of alternative models of endogenous policy choice. 
              The project develops a new general framework for the analysis of dynamic policy
              choice in settings with sequential voting.  This framework is used to study the
              conditions under which the nature of distributive problems (income
              distribution, skill distribution, distribution of industry specific human
              capital) can prevent the adoption of efficient policies.
