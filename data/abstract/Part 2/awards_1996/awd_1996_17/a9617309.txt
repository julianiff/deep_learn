              Research Instrumentation: Intelligent Assistance for Multiple Robots    This
              award supports the purchase of equipment to be used in the following research
              projects: -Intelligent Assistance of remote Robots using a Tactical
              Agent-Intelligent Assistance for Problem Solving for Multiple Robots.  Multiple
              autonomous robots have a wide variety of applications, including Urban Search
              and Rescue, hazardous waste cleanup, and planetary rovers.  Full autonomy for
              these robots is often unrealistic given the current state of AI and demands of
              the domain.  Two research projects will investigate aspects of semi-autonomous
              control for multi-agents.  One project will extend work in the search of
              physical spaces to address issues of how to use a tactical robot to
              intelligently assist in the coordination and control of remote robots.  The
              tactical robot will interpret the teleoperator's strategic commands for the
              inspection robots for the immediate situation and supplement and/or modify them
              in order to safely control the inspection robots.  The project will contribute
              a better understanding of cooperative heterogenous agents, thereby improving
              task performance, reducing cognitive fatigue, and minimizing teleoperator
              training. The second project will extend visual interaction methods for problem
              solving in order to allow a teleoperator to simultaneously control and diagnose
              failures in remote robots without cognitive fatigue. The expected contributions
              include a new paradigm of intelligent assistance, not restricted to robotics,
              based on differences in the agents' cognitive abilities.
