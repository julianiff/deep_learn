Abstract    :
              The California College of Podiatric Medicine requests support from NSF to
              connect it's campus to the Internet.  The College, located in the San Francisco
              with approximately 400 students, is one of seven podiatric medical schools in
              the nation.  The college intends to connect through AimNet a local Internet
              service provider.  The campus needs the Internet connection to be able to
              access information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world. 
              The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of this institution as
              well as the community in general.  The award provides partial support of the
              project for two years.
