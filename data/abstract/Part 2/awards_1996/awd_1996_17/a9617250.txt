Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9617250    The purpose of this Small Grant for Exploratory
              Research (SGER) is to prepare, characterize, and demonstrate photoactivity of a
              novel mesostructured tatanium dioxide.  The reaction studied is the oxidation
              of  2-propanol to acetone.  The material is produced by the method develop last
              year by the Ying group at MIT.    If this demonstration of photoactivity is
              successful, it will form the basis for a large study of  photooxidation
              processes with these materials for both waste disposal and chemical 
              manufacturing.
