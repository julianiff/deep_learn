Abstract    :
              Giovanelli, Riccardo  AST 96-17069    Dr. Giovanelli will continue a three-part
              observational  study to improve the understanding of the distribution of  light
              and matter in the universe, to provide a large-scale  reference frame in the
              determination of the deviations from  Hubble flow and to improve the accuracy
              of estimates of the  universal expansion rate.  The distances to the galaxies 
              will be measured mainly by the Tully-Fisher relation.  The observations will
              consist of surface photometry data  for about 1000 spiral galaxies, I band
              surface photometry  and optical rotation curves of about 750 galaxies, and 
              spectroscopy of a dozen host galaxies of SN Type Ia.
