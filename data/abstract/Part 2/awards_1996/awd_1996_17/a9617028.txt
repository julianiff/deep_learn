Abstract    :
              Hewitt, Jacqueline  AST 96-17028    Dr. Hewitt will observe and interpret
              gravitational lenses.  The first part of the planned research is a monitoring 
              program to measure the difference in propagation time  associated with multiple
              images of a back ground source.  The second part is to distinguish variability
              of the  background source from that due to propagation effects.  The third part
              is to measure the imaging properties of the  gravitational lenses to model the
              mass distributions in the  lenses.  The fourth and final part is to study
              strong  lensing of extended radio lobes to measure the mass  distribution in
              galaxies.
