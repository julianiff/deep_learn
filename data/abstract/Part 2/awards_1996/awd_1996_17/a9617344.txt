Abstract    :
              9617344  Twisdale  The project will use failure data collected on occasion of 
              Hurricane Bertha making land fall in North Carolina on July  1996, using an
              unbiased sample of structures affected within  the designed wind speed region
              of the storm for testing  structures with an integrated building performance 
              prediction method.  In the project a numerical windfield  model of validated
              and re-created storm windfield data will  be integrated with wind tunnel test
              data to predict loads on  building components and on cladding components
              resistance  models.  The result will be an end-to-end model for  evaluating
              structure cladding performance.  The importance  of these results are reflected
              in the fact that cladding  loss of integrity results in wind and water
              penetration  which in turn produce the damage of building contents and  great
              total economic losses.    ***
