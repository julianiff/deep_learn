Abstract    :
               This award supports research to enhance the application and use of solid
              freeform fabrication (SFF) through the development of a language for the
              separation of the design and fabrication functions.  SFF is an emerging
              technology that enables the rapid fabrication of a nearly unrestricted range of
              geometrically designed parts.  This research   addresses three topics:  (1) the
              development of a reduced instruction functional specification language
              consisting of a basic voca`ulary for specifying functional performance and
              mechanisms for combining primitive elements of this vocabulary to produce
              complete system specifications; (2) a synthesis methodology to generate design
              descriptions satisfying functional requirements that will bring   together the
              conception, geometric abstraction, idealization, mesh generation, simulation,
              and optimization stages of design in a unified concurrent framework; and (3) an
              encapsulated interchange format for the digital interface between design and
              fabrication.   The successful completion of this research would greatly enhance
                the emergence of SFF technologies.  These technologies could provide
              substantially enhanced capability to designers,  particularly by expanding the
              range of designs that can be fabricated, and they would significantly reduce
              the time to market for new products.  These advances would greatly improve the
              competitiveness of U.S. industry.
