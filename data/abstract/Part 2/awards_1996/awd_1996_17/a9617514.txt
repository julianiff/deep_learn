Abstract    :
                  Instrumentation necessary to apply the novel technique of  hyperpolarized
              xenon-129 magnetic resonance imaging and  spectroscopy to biological
              investigations conducted in vitro  and with living plants and animals will be
              developed. This  instrumentation will include an optical pumping chamber to 
              generate the hyperpolarized xenon, a gas delivery system for  administration of
              the gas to the animal and a low temperature  trap for removal of the rubidium
              vapor (necessary for the  generation process). This technique will result in
              greater  sensitivity and contrast in magnetic resonance spectroscopy  and
              magnetic resonance imaging when applied to these systems.  It will aid in
              illuminating such systems and problems as: the  integrity and function of
              excitable lipid membranes; the  relation of lung structure to lung mechanical
              properties; gas  diffusion within the lung; regional blood flow and 
              oxygenation in the brain; functional cortical mapping;  intercellular gas
              diffusion in leaves and other plant organs;  and water fluxes in roots and
              leaves.
