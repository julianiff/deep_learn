Abstract    :
              Smith, Harding  96-17126    Dr. Smith will continue his program of observational
              studies  of the relationship between dusty active galactic nuclei and  luminous
              starburst galaxies.  The two  phenomena starbursts,  where rapid formation of
              massive, hot, young stars produces  high luminous energy output, and active
              galactic nuclei,  thought to be powered by gravitational energy as a massive 
              compact object accretes material at the nucleus of a galaxy  -- are found
              together in many galaxies and there is evidence  that there may be a causal or
              evolutionary relationship  between them.  Images will be obtained of galaxies
              to  determine the distribution of emissions and to separate  extended
              emissions, so that models for these galaxies can be  constructed and theories
              about the evolution of these  systems may be directly tested.
