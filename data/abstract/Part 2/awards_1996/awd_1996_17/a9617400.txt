Abstract    :
              9617400  Watson    This project will provide assistance to the NSF's PAEMST
              Program by planning and implementing a meeting for the state coordinators for
              the Program.  The primary goal of the meeting is to provide participants with
              opportunities to provide advice to NSF on the future of the PAEMST Program. 
              Specifically, the conference will:  (1) promote more uniformity in the state
              selection process; (2) increase the number of applicants to the Program
              (particularly applicants from underrepresented groups); and (3) establish an
              ongoing relationship between the state coordinators and the newly created
              umbrella awardee organization.
