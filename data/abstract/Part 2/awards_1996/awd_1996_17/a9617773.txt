Abstract    :
              9617773  Sastry  Biomedical engineering represents an area of extreme  interest
              to both the medical and engineering communities.  Significant interaction is
              required to generate the  synergism required to merge the engineering
              disciplines with  physiological constraints.    This grant provides funds for
              travel to a technical  conference that brings together the researchers in both 
              medicine and engineering to merge their efforts.  It also  provides an
              opportunity to allow practitioners to interface  with researchers.  ***
