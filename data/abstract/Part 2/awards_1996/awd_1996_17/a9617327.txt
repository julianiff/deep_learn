Abstract    :
              9617327  Kuipers, Benjamin J.  Wood, Kristin L.  The University of Texas at
              Austin    CISE Research Instrumentation:  Research on Assistive Intelligence   
               To support several ongoing research projects in computer and information
              science and engineering, the Departments of Computer Sciences and Mechanical
              Engineering at the University of Texas at   Austin are acquiring a mobile robot
              configured as an intelligent wheelchair.  It consists of a powered wheelchair
              base augmented with proximity sensors, visual sensors, manipulation capability,
                speech input and output, and onboard computation. The robot provides a test
              and application for our Spatial Semantic Hierarchy theory of spatial knowledge
              in the cognitive map, and for our research on goal-oriented computer vision. It
              also supports a collaboration between University of Texas researchers and
              occupational therapists at the Rosedale School in Austin, developing the
              intelligent wheelchair as assistive technology for people with disabilities
              such as cerebral palsy. Advances in intelligent robotics serve the assistive
              technology application by improving the service the wheelchair can provide for
              its driver.  Meanwhile, the presence of an intelligent driver can compensate
              for limitations of the robot.The results of this research should be important
              for other application areas where intelligent man-machine systems would be
              useful, including space telerobotics, manufacturing and construction
              automation, and intelligent transportation systems.
