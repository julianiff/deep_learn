Abstract    :
              9617777  Trayanova  Biomedical engineering represents an area of extreme 
              interest to both the medical and engineering communities.  Significant
              interaction is required to generate the  synergism required to merge the
              engineering disciplines with  physiological constraints.    This grant provides
              funds for travel to a technical  conference that brings together the
              researchers in both  medicine and engineering to merge their efforts.  It also 
              provides an opportunity to allow practitioners to interface  with researchers.
