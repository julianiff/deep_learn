              Title:  Beam-Plasma Experiments with Picosecond Relativistic Electron Bunches  
               This research will utilize very recent advances in photoinjector electron
              source development to study ultrafast relativistic electron bunch/ plasma
              interactions in previously inaccessible regimes.   A laser-driven photocathode
              in combination with a high-gradient, radio frequency (RF) accelerator is used
              to produce an ultrashort (4 picoseconds), high current (Ipeak > 1 kAmp),
              relativistic (g > 20 which g is the relativistic Lorentz factor) intense
              electron bunch, which then interacts with a pre-formed discharge plasma. 
              Previous experiments have been limited to electron beam bunches of tens of
              nanoseconds and energies of less than 1 MeV.  The research will focus on two
              applications:  (1) focusing of a relativistic electron beam by an underdense
              plasma lens and (2) excitation of plasma wakefields for particle acceleration.
              Graduate and undergraduate student involvement is explicitly planned and will
              provide valuable training for students in fast optics, high power optics,
              plasma physics and beam physics.
