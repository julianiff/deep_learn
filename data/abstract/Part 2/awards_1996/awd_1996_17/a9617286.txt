Abstract    :
              Posture and locomotion are two of the most important influences on the
              adaptation and evolution of the musculoskeletal system in primates.  This is
              especially true of  the spine, which plays a key functional role in both
              posture and locomotor behavior.  The purpose of this study is to investigate
              the relationship between back function and vertebral structure in a broad
              sample of prosimian primates.  Prosimian diversity in body size, anatomy,
              posture, and locomotion makes them an excellent `natural experiment` with which
              to investigate vertebral form and function.  The methodology will address form
              as well as function by employing two approaches:  1) quantitative analysis of
              vertebral anatomical structure, and 2) quantitative analysis of spinal
              movements using noninvasive video analysis.  The results of this study will be
              directly relevant to reconstructions of locomotor and postural adaptations in
              fossil primates, thereby contributing to a more thorough understanding of
              primate evolution, including the adaptations to upright posture that led to
              human bipedalism.
