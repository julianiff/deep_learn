Abstract    :
                  This project connects College of Visual Arts to the Internet over a T1
              (1.544 million bits per second) line.  Faculty and students at the school
              benefit from access to the resources of the Internet, including libraries and
              supercomputers.  In addition, they are able to communicate and collaborate with
              colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of research and educational
              projects.  The award provides partial support of the project for two years.
