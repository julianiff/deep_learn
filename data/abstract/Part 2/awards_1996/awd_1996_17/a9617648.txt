                Project Abstract  Project Abstract:  This doctoral dissertation research is
              conducted  by Nicole Bouchez under the supervision of Daniel Friedman.   The
              economy is full of businesses buying and selling goods and services, but how do
              they know about their rivals' incentives?  Little is known about how groups of
              people or businesses learn about each other's incentives when they are not
              directly observable.  Several competing theoretical models have been suggested
              that show learning through economic interactions, however few empirical
              comparisons of these models have been made.   This project conducts a series of
              computerized laboratory experiments to investigate group learning in
              three-choice bimatrix games.  The bimatrix games allow players to see their own
              options and contingent payoffs, but do not allow them to see their opponents'
              payoffs.  This structure is broadly applicable and is a key step towards
              general, multiple choice, strategic interactions.  The data collected are used
              to compare how well the different models of learning predict individual
              actions.
