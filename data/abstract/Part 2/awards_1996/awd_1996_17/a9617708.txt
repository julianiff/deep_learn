Abstract    :
                A longstanding discussion in political theory concerns the relationship
              between factions and the possibility of attaining the common good.  Madison,
              for example, argued that the effects of faction could be mitigated under
              certain circumstances.  This research begins with the premise that factions
              involve groups of individuals whose choices are highly correlated.  This
              assumption, which is in line with traditional concepts of factions, allows
              recent statistical techniques in multinomial probit (MNP) modelling to be used
              to indirectly compute behavioral correlations in a population.  To test the
              capacity of this modelling strategy, MNP is used to generate geometric
              representations of six European polities and the U.S. Congress.  Such models
              clarify the extent to which centripetal or centrifugal political forces connect
              factional patterns to political parties.  The nations chosen for analysis allow
              for tests of several different electoral systems and how those voting rules
              give rise to a multitude of parties with a dominant center party.
