Abstract    :
              This project connects the College of Micronesia to the Internet four  dial-up
              lines and 28,800 baud per second modems.  This is an unusual  connection method
              necessitated by the extremely high cost of telephone  service in Micronesia. 
              The connection will be upgraded when higher  bandwidth service is available at
              affordable rates.  Faculty and students  at the school benefit from access to
              the resources of the Internet.  In  addition, they are able to communicate and
              collaborate with colleagues at  other institutions in pursuit of research and
              educational projects.  The  award provides partial support of the project for
              two years.
