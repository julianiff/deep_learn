Abstract    :
              9617972    Key    In this project, the PI will continue to assemble and quality-
               control the WOCE Carbon-14 data set, to begin synthesis of that  data, and to
              collaborate with modelers in applying the data to  quantitative model
              comparison and validation.  In addition to  quantitative and qualitative
              descriptions of the radiocarbon  fields, focus will be on thermocline
              ventilation in the North and  South Pacific, mixing, upwelling, transport and
              particle flux in  the deep and abyssal North Pacific, deep return circulation
              in  the Pacific, and description of the global correlation between  carbon-14
              and silicate.
