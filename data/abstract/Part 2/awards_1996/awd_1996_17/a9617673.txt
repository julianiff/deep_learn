Abstract    :
              9617673  Sen    Title: Upgrading the electron microprobe at Florida
              International  University    The Geology Department at Florida International
              University houses  a 25 year old electron probe microanalyzer that is used in
              the  chemical analysis of minerals and materials. This instrument still 
              produces publishable analyses but lately its overall capabilities  have been
              seriously impaired by persistent vacuum problems, loss of  imaging
              capabilities, and beam instability. This project is to  replace/upgrade some of
              the necessary components so that the  instrument can be routinely used for
              microanalysis again.
