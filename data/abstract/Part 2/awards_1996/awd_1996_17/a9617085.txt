Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT: CMS-9617085, Maria Todorovska, U of Southern  California    The Los
              Angeles Vicinity Strong Motion Array consists of 80  stations (each recording
              three components of ground  acceleration) distributed through-out the Los
              Angeles  metropolitan area. During 15 years of operation, this array  has
              recorded many earthquakes of magnitude 3 and greater,  including, the 1987
              Whittier-Narrows (M=5.9), 1990 Upland  (M=5.2), 1991 Sierra Madre (M=5.8), 1992
              Landers (M=7.5) and  the 1994 Northridge (M=6.7) earthquakes.    The digitized
              data recorded by the network is valuable for  numerous earthquake engineering
              applications. The processed  data is made available to the public.    This
              action is to fund the basic maintenance of the network  for the period of one
              year. Maintenance is essential to  ensure that the instruments are in good
              working condition to  record future earthquake ground shaking.
