Abstract    :
              ***  9617613  Rollins  The lateral load capacity of foundation piles and pile
              groups is a key consideration in earthquake hazard mitigation.  Because of the
              cost and logistical difficulties of full-scale testing, only three pile group
              tests are currently available to guide engineers regarding pile group behavior,
              especially under dynamic loading.  Due to the dearth of experimental data,
              computer programs for analyzing pile groups have not been thoroughly validated,
              and empirical methods are extremely restricted in their application.  This is
              particularly true when it comes to dynamic loading such as earthquakes.  As a
              result, designers are forced to be conservative and this leads to increased
              costs for retrofits as well as new construction.    Brigham Young University is
              performing a series of lateral load tests on a full-scale pile group in soft
              clay at the Salt Lake International Airport.  This testing involves both static
              and dynamic testing at large strain levels.    The objective of this action is
              to support additional low-strain vibration testing of the pile group, thereby
              providing data for calibrating and validating computer models.  Since the pile
              group is already in place, and soil exploration is completed, the incremental
              cost of performing these additional tests is small in comparison to the
              information to be gained.  Due to time constraints on the original test
              schedule, it is necessary to expedite the schedule for the low strain testing:
              once the large-strain testing is completed, it is impossible to obtain
              meaningful small strain results.    The low-strain vibration testing is
              conducted with an eccentric mass shaker which is mounted on top of a pile cap. 
              The testing makes it possible to obtain the natural frequency of the pile-soil
              system, as well as the stiffness and damping at low strain levels.  These
              parameters, in combination with the large-strain parameters, provide an
              excellent case history which researchers can use to validate their computer
              codes for both static and dyna mic conditions.***
