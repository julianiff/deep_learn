Abstract    :
              OCE 96-17356  Swift    The project will evaluate the ability of polarimetric 
              radiometry  (a passive microwave remote sensing technique) to measure  wind
              speed and direction over the ocean.  In particular, the  polarimetric technique
              will be compared to scatterometry (an  active technique presently used from
              satellites). This  proposal  will support data analysis focussing on the
              characteristics  of  the polarimetric radiometry measurements, their evaluation
               in  the context of theoretical models, and direct comparison to 
              scatterometric and in-situ observations of the wind vector.  The  expected
              result is a thorough assessment of polarimetric  radiometry for the measurement
              of the ocean wind vector.
