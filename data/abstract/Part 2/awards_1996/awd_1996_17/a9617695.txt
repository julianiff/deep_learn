Abstract    :
              SBR-9617695    This award supports the provision of small travel grants to
              graduate students from U.S. institutions to assist their attendance and
              participation in the 1997 Annual Assembly of the University Consortium for
              Geographic Information Science.  Students to be so supported will be selected
              on the basis of a panel review of their 2000-word abstracts of the
              presentations they plan to make at the assembly.  Grants will not be made to
              students based within 250 miles of the assembly (to be held in Maine).  The
              assembly has two components:  the exchange of research findings and progress
              among researchers and students (their presentations are to be integrated within
              sessions), and the identification of priorities for education (primarily
              college and graduate) in the interdisciplinary field of geographic information
              science.      This small award fulfills two major goals of NSF:  the
              development and dissemination of improved tools for scientific analysis, and
              the integration of research and education.
