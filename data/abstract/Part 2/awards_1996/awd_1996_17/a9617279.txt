              Instrumentation: A Physical Layer Radio Communications Laboratory    This grant
              supports instrumentation to enable the following research:  -Narrowband Radio
              Services Design Telecommunications Circuit Design Wideband Radio Design 
              Automated Highway System Communications.  This project sets up a physical layer
              radio research laboratory at the Ohio State University (OSU) which empowers a
              variety of multidisciplinary research in data communication. The equipment
              enables the construction and support of a highly flexible testbed for physical
              layer radio research.   This test bed consists of real-time digital signal
              processors, microwave signal sources, high power linear amplifiers, antennas,
              radio receivers, data acquisition electronics, workstation and personal
              computers, and   supporting electronic test equipment.  The laboratory is the
              focus of ongoing experimental work in the development of high performance
              narrowband wireless modems and will spur new experimental work in wideband
              multiple access radio design. In particular investigations into improving
              transmitter and receiver antenna diversity and signal processing for
              interference suppression or multiuser demodulation can now be backed with
              experimental feedback. Much greater gains in bandwidth efficiencies are
              potentially achievable by being able to measure and exploit the actual channel
              characteristics.   Additionally the laboratory will be the focus of ongoing
              research in the area of high power amplifier linearization and very large scale
              integrated circuit design. Finally much of this work supports a modem being
              developed for Intelligent Transportation Applications (ITS). The Center for
              Intelligent Transportation Research is a nationally designated center of
              excellence for automated highway research (AHS).  This laboratory will be the
              focal point for a wireless modem development for potential use in AHS
              applications within the national ITS program.
