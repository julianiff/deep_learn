              CISE Research Instrumentation: A Data-Intensive Distributed Computing System   
               As ever larger data sets--both structured and unstructured--are created and
              digitized, new techniques are need to better store, organize, and access this
              data.  This is challenging since mass storage subsystem performance has
              increased slowly relative to processor performance and because data is usually
              distributed over computers which communicate using high-speed networks.  Hence,
              new storage optimization techniques are needed for both performance and
              availability.  This research instrumentation grant facilitates acquiring a
              system consisting of workstations with very large experimental disk and tape
              capacity, communicating over very high speed networks to empowered research in
              the following projects: -Persistent Object Store System- Dynamically
              Distributed Replication Experiments-Picture and Video Retrieval by Contents
              System-Distributed Database Processing System Experimental evaluation of
              realistic data-intensive applications and systems will thus be enabled. The
              equipment will be used to construct a picture and video retrieval by contents
              application enabling large video archives to be queried by characteristics.  A
              distributed deductive database system targeted initially at answering protein
              data bank queries enables rule-based data analysis.  These applications exist
              in prototype form and will now be scaled to realistic sized systems, enabling
              better understanding of performance and semantics.  Complementing these
              applications is system research on constructing large scale object stores and
              distributed replication of data.  This systems research would enable the
              construction of higher performance, more flexible stores while easing the
              programming burden.
