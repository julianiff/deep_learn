Abstract    :
                  Burrows, Adam  AST  96-17494    Dr. Burrows continues his theoretical
              investigations into the physics and the mechanisms of core-  collapse
              supernovae.  He will refine the treatment of neutrino transport and
              multi-dimensional   effects to determine their roles in the mechanism of
              core-collapse. By extending his previous   work to consider a range of
              progenitor masses, he will investigate the systematic effects the   structure
              of the progenitor star has on features such as the delay to explosion, the
              explosion   energy, the mass cut and the ejecta electron fractions.   In
              addition, he will investigate the   hypothesis that r-process heavy element
              nucleosynthesis occurs in the wind from the star late in   the supernovae
              explosion by detailed modeling of the dependence of nucleosynthesis to wind  
              properties.  He will also explore the effects that asymmetries in the core
              itself may have on both   the core collapse and its signature as gravitational
              waves and neutrinos.    ***
