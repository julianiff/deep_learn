Abstract    :
              Cornillon  9617804  The objectives of this effort are: to populate a client 
              server based  Distributed Oceanographic Data System (DODS) with a number  of
              additional  data sets of broad interest to the oceanographic community,  to
              provide user  support for the system and enhance the system to facilitate  its
              use. The  population effort consists of three parts; (1) the writing  of
              servers for data  sets, (2) the addition of new DODS supported application 
              program  interfaces, and (3) the development of tools to help  scientists write
              data  servers. Systems enhancements will include writing Graphical  User 
              Interfaces (GUI) for some of the most commonly used analysis  packages, a  Web
              browser designed to read and display data accessible via  DODS-  compliant
              servers and a uniform, user selectable,  representation for time  and space.
