Abstract    :
              Turnshek, David  AST 96-17151    Dr. Turnshek will study quasars in
              collaboration with astronomers  in Moscow (Russia) and Tashkent (Uzbekistan) to
              monitor  brightness variations in quiescent QSOs and to correlate the 
              variations with other QSO properties.  A sample of moderate  redshift, i.e. z
              is in the range from 1.5 to 2.5, has some  observations back to 1987, but
              entered a new phase with the  recent loan of the University of Pittsburgh CCD
              camera to  Maidanak Observatory in Uzbekistan.
