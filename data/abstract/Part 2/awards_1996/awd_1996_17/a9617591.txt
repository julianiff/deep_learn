Abstract    :
              ***  9617591  Curlander    Radarsat is a Canadian satellite carrying a synthetic
              aperture radar (SAR) sensor that is capable of mapping the Antarctic continent
              in stereo using multiple passes.  SAR data are commercially available and can
              be downlinked to a network of ground receiving stations including the NSF
              operated McMurdo Station.  Before SAR imagery can be effectively used by
              scientists, corrections must be made for geometric distortions
              (orthorectification), which require a digital elevation map (DEM).  However,
              for most of the continent current topographic data have relatively low accuracy
              and resolution.  DEM data will considerably improve maps produced by the
              NASA-funded Radarsat Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP), a mosaicking and
              orthorectification package to be used by scientists at Ohio State University's
              Byrd Polar Research Center (BPRC).  In addition to providing rectified imagery,
              higher resolution DEMs will also provide geologists and glacioloqists an
              important new means to assess questions about Antarctica's qeodynamic and ice
              dynamic processes.  Phase II will develop a system for automatically deriving
              detailed surface topography and orthorectified images from a Radarsat SAR
              stereo pair and its ancillary data.  A Unix development platform will be used,
              and the system will be validated.    The new technology is expected to have
              commercial applications in radar stereo processing software for mapping
              projects worldwide.  Additional business potential is seen in processing
              services to users of Radarsat and other radar data and in small scale receiving
              stations for processing satellite radar data at university and other research
              laboratories.
