Abstract    :
              9617925  Horowitz    The bootstrap is a method of estimating the distribution of
              an estimator or test statistic by resampling one's data.  It amounts to
              treating the data as if they were the population for the purpose of evaluating
              the distribution of interest.  Under suitable conditions the bootstrap provides
              a better finite-sample approximation to the distribution of a test statistic
              and better finite-sample critical values than does first-order asymptotic
              theory.  As a result, the differences between the true and nominal levels of
              tests and overage probabilities of confidence intervals are often much smaller
              using critical values obtained through the bootstrap than critical values based
              on first-order asymptotic theory.  Bootstrap has demonstrated for a number of
              economic applications spectacular reductions in finite-sample distortions of
              the levels of tests.  The proposed research develops methods for applying the
              bootstrap to several important problems in applied econometrics where the
              bootstrap may have substantial advantages over alternative methods but that
              cannot be handled satisfactorily using standard bootstrap theory.  These are:  
               a.  Hypothesis tests based on non-smooth estimators;    b.  Bandwidth
              selection for semiparametric estimators;    c.  Hypothesis tests based on
              instrumental-variables (IV) estimation with weak instruments.        ??
