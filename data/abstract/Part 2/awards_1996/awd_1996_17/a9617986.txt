Abstract    :
              9617986    Rossby    In  this  project,  the  PI  will collaborate  in  a 
              cooperative  research  effort to study the mid-depth circulation around  South 
              Africa and in the Southeastern Atlantic.  Other collaborators are  from   the  
              Lamont-Doherty  Earth  Observatory,  NOAA   Atlantic  Oceanographic  and 
              Meteorology  Laboratory,  the  Institute  fur  Meerskunde,  in  Kiel, Germany,
              and the University  of  Capetown,  South  Africa.   The  first objective is to
              use  isopycnal  RAFOS  floats  to  determine  pathways of  dispersal  from  the
               Agulhas  Current   as   it  approaches  the  region  where   the   current 
              retroflects,  and to determine the conditions under which  waters  recycle  to
              the east.  The second objective is to start a program  of  direct measurements
              of mass transport of the Agulhas  Current  off  Durban, using a combination of
              velocity measurement  (Global  Positioning System with POGO) and hydrographic
              casts.  POGO is  a  modern version of the dropsonde, used some two decades ago.
               This  project  will provide 50 RAFOS floats in the first  year,  and  4  POGO
              instruments in the second year.
