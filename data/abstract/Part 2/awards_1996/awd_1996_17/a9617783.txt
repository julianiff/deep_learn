Abstract    :
              9617783  Mark    An Institute for Curriculum Selection and Implementation in
              K-12 Mathematics Education is established by the Education Development Center
              (EDC).  This institute helps districts shape their vision for a successful
              mathematics education program by providing services and products - workshops,
              resource guides and videos, and connections to other sources through the World
              Wide Web - to help facilitate discussions and decision making among the various
              stakeholders in the districts.  Suitable materials are developed to facilitate
              implementation, including a guide to selecting a curriculum and case studies
              that examine abstract and complex issues regarding curriculum implementation in
              the context of real situations.  Workshops are offered for school districts at
              EDC and at other sites around the country.
