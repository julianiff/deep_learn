Abstract    :
                The five educational districts serving the city of Ponce, Puerto Rico, have
              joined together to propose a self-study  on the status of K-12 science and
              mathematics, and technology education (SMTE) for the purposes of designing a
              plan for the systemic reform of SMTE in the Ponce schools.    Ponce has a total
              population of 47,901 children between the ages of 5-17, of which 33,226 or 69%
              live in poverty according to the U.S. Census.  The eight educational districts
              in (Ponce I-IV) serve a student population of over 30,735 in 75 schools.  These
              districts are part of the Puerto Rico Department of Education which is the
              central educational agency on the island comprising 100 districts with eight
              educational regions.  A total of 890 teachers are providing instruction in
              science or mathematics in the five Ponce districts, 646 at the elementary
              level, 169 at the intermediate level, and 75 in high schools.    The Planning
              grant will support the establishment of an ongoing system to monitor the
              quality of the city's science and mathematics program and the articulation of a
              coherent and comprehensive plan to transform science and mathematics to higher
              level learning opportunities for all students.  The effort will be carried out
              in collaboration with the central level programs of Science and Mathematics of
              the Department of Education, The Resource Center for Science and Engineering
              (RCSE) at the University of Puerto Rico, the city of Ponce, community
              organizations and the private sector.  The Puerto Rico Statewide Systemic
              Initiative program will play a major collaborative role in supporting the
              planning activities, as well as other such as Dwight D. Eisenhower Programs,
              Title I, Puerto Rico Education 2000, and School to Work programs.
