Abstract    :
                    This project connects Wallace Community College in Selma AL to the
              Internet over a T1 (1.544 million bits per second) line.  Faculty and students
              at the school benefit from access to the resources of the Internet, including
              libraries and supercomputers.  In addition, they are able to communicate and
              collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of research and
              educational projects.  The award provides partial support of the project for
              two years.
