Abstract    :
              9617852  Kastens    The two-year project will produce a CD-ROM package to help
              students in grades 2-4 develop the ability to make, read, and interpret maps.
              The learning outcomes align closely with the national standards for geography
              education for grades K-4. The project will revise and elaborate on a pilot
              version of a computer-aided learning tool and develop an accompanying teacher's
              guide. The software and print materials are to help students develop their
              ability to translate mentally between their visually-perceived,
              three-dimensional physical surroundings and a schematic representation of that
              reality (i.e., a map). Students will use the CD-ROM to learn about and practice
              mapping skills and will apply those skills in developing and following maps in
              the area in and around their school. The product will be commercially published
              and disseminated as a CD-ROM with supporting print materials.
