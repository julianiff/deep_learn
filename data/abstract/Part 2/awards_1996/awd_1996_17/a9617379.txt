Abstract    :
              9617379  Marchand  This is a collaborative project between researchers at the
              Univ. of Pittsburgh, and the Univ. of California at San Diego (UCSD).  The goal
              of the project is to produce design analysis and virtual prototyping tools for
              mixed technology free space optoelectronic information processing systems.  The
              design tools will be based on current work in modeling and simulation of
              optoelectronic signals and devices at the Univ. of Pittsburgh, and device
              fabrication, modeling and testing at UCSD.  These efforts will be expanded to
              include functional, physical and parametric models for devices and
              interconnections using a framework that will support the composition of these
              models into complete systems.  The resulting optoelectronic system prototyping
              tool suite will be made available to the academic community, and is expected to
              accelerate the insertion of photonics technology in traditionally
              microelectronic applications.  ***
