Abstract    :
              9617951  Clark       Videodiscovery will design and produce a CD-ROM software
              engine that will deliver a collection of science performance-based assessment
              tasks for grades 5-8.  The work will be modeled after another successful
              Videodiscovery Project, Science Sleuths.  The content of these tasks will be in
              line with the National Science Education Standards, and include the use of
              video clips, graphics, virtual tools for information gathering, and simulation
              techniques.  A sophisticated scoring system for scoring student performance
              will be embedded in each performance event, thereby eliminating the need for
              time-consuming teacher scoring and contributing to improved economy and
              reliability.    Using this technology to deliver performance assessments will
              overcome many of the obstacles that prevent frequent and widespread use of
              performance tasks in test settings.  Well-designed, field-tested tasks that are
              delivered electronically, will enable teachers to obtain frequent and ongoing
              feedback on student performance and these tasks can enhance the opportunity for
              successful science education reform.
