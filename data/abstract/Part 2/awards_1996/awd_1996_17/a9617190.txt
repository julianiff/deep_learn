Abstract    :
                Hall  9617190  This project will create a 50 state supreme court data base. 
              These data will facilitate theoretically focused empirical studies that are
              essential to the progress of comparative judicial scholarship generally and
              state court research specifically.  The data will combine state supreme court
              judge votes, case outcomes and case characte4ristics with judge attributes,
              institutional procedures and selected state contextual variables.  Judicial
              scholarship heretofore has examined single states or 50 state studies at very
              high levels of aggregation.  The result has been a compartmentalization of
              findings and a disjunction between micro and macro level explanations of
              judicial behavior and outcomes.  This project will provide the systematic data
              that will hasten the development of theory that connects the law and judges
              with their institutional, political, and social contexts.  These data will
              promote diverse theoretical efforts and rigorous methodological debates.  Data
              will be archived at the ICPSR and a web page will be constructed to publicize
              the data and to facilitate the exchange of useful information among users.  %%%
