Abstract    :
                White  9617712  This project explores the economics of financial distress and
              the use by debtors and creditors of such procedures as bankruptcy, wage
              garnishment and debt renegotiation.  Although more than one million individuals
              or households will file for bankruptcy in 1996 (a fourfold increase since
              1983), researchers have devoted little attention to this phenomenon.  This
              research will fill that void.  This project has three parts.  In the first, the
              new Panel Study of Income Dynamics will be used to estimate a model of debtors'
              decision to file for bankruptcy and to test whether a "bankruptcy stigma"
              exists.  In the second part, a new data set on small firm financial distress
              focusing on small firms bankruptcy situations will be analyzed.  The decisions
              small firms make and the interactions between these firms and their creditors
              will be the primary focus of this part.  Finally, the project will explore
              reforms of U.S. consumer bankruptcy law. Theoretical modeling of features of
              current law and the features of optimal law will be examined.  .  %%%  This
