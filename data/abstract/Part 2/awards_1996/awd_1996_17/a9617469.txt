Abstract    :
              ***    9617469  Traub    This research looks at the relation between phenomena
              and models of phenomena in scientific theories.  It is especially germane to
              theories in developing fields, like cognitive science, where the mathematical
              and computational models today are tentative and may not connect well in their
              theoretical constructs with phenomenological  constructs coming out of the
              empirical side of the science.  The goals are to a)  Formulate the issues
              regarding empirical reality and scientific models more precisely so that limits
              on knowability can be understood; b) Compare and contrast limitative results
              across fields like cognitive science, biology, economics, and physics; and c) 
              Review scholarly work on limits that is scattered across disciplines.    ***
