Abstract    :
              9617781  Jullig  An international workshop on Constructive Programming will be 
              held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to explore future directions in  formal methods,
              programming logics, and programming languages.  The workshop will take place
              November 4 to 8, 1996 and will  combine 3 days of technical exchange with 2
              days of discussions  to produce recommendations to the science funding agencies
              of the  U.S. and Brazil: NSF, CNPq, and FINEP.    In recent years Brazilian
              researchers have made significant  contributions in constructive programming
              and related areas,  establishing a number of contacts with U.S. researchers.
              This  workshop will promote further collaborations and provide  information and
              recommendations for future research efforts and  funding initiatives.  ***
