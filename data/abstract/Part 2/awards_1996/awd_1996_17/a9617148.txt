Abstract    :
              9617148  Roberts   This award provides funds to partially support the five day
              workshop, "Statistical   Physics Methods in Discrete Probability,
              Combinatorics, and Theoretical Computer   Science" to be held March 23-27, 1997
              at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.   The goal of the workshop is
              to bring together researchers working at the interface of   statistical
              physics, probability, combinatorics and theoretical computer science with the  
              intention of developing a common language and recognizing parallels among the  
              fundamental problems being addressed in these disciplines. There will be
              several   introductory lectures surveying some of the major themes of the
              workshop. In addition,   there will be more advanced lectures giving junior and
              senior researchers opportunities to   present recent results. There will be
              ample time for discussion of open problems.
