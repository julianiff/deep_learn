Abstract    :
              Cheng  9617030    This grant is funded to study the effect of molecular 
              architecture on the self-ordering and self-assembly  mechanisms in a series of
              well defined crystalline  poly(ethylene oxide)s (PEOs) and their diblock
              copolymers  having novel molecular and supra-molecular structures.  In 
              particular, molecular architecture can be controlled by  synthesizing different
              molecular shapes and conformations.  The two-arm PEOs provide an opportunity to
              study the defect  effect at the center of the chain molecules compared with 
              linear PEOs having twice the molecular length of each arm,  while three- and
              four-arm star-PEOs serve as model compounds  for study of the molecular shape
              dependence on the self-  ordering and self-assembly process.  Furthermore, it
              is  interesting to study transition behaviors and morphological  changes for
              two-arm PEOs having different linkage positions  at the coupling agents.  This
              research can be extended to  the investigation of supra-molecular structural
              dependence  on the process via diblock copolymers containing  crystallizable
              PEO components.  %%%  It is believed that these studies of controlled molecular
               architecture in both the star-PEOs and diblock copolymers  will provide
              significant new experimental evidence for  achieving further understanding in
              the research are of  polymer crystallization.
