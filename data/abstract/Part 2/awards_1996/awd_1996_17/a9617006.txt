Abstract    :
              Frogel, Jay  96-17006    Dr. Frogel will analyze the galaxy images obtained  in
              the Ohio State University Galaxy Survey.  The  survey obtained six optical and
              near-IR images of  each of 105 spiral galaxies so far.  It will be  expanded to
              230 spirals, chosen as those with blue  magnitude brighter than 12.  The
              objective of the  project is to study galaxy morphology, dust  content, stellar
              populations and dynamics.  The  final calibrated images will be made available
              to  the astronomical community.
