Abstract    :
              Silk, Joseph  96-17168    Dr. Silk will research several fundamental  problems
              in theoretical astrophysics and cosmology  that focus on the cosmic microwave
              background.  One representative  problem is the study of the  angular
              anisotropy of the cosmic microwave  background radiation in different
              cosmological  models, where the small observed deviations from  anisotropy
              probe the origin of the large-scale  structure in the universe.  A second
              example is  the study of galaxy formation and evolution.  Improving models for
              the global star formation  rate and application to the early evolution of 
              disks and protogalaxies will aid predictions of  their luminosity, spectral and
              chemical evolution.
