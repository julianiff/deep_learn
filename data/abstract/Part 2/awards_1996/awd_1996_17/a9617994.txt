Abstract    :
              The key impediment to the widespread use of 3D layered fabrication like Shape 
              Deposition Manufacturing (SDM) and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) 
              processes is not the limitations of the processes themselves, but the ability
              of  engineers to explore and master the expanded design space they enable.  A
              design  interface comprising an exchange format and an accompanying suite of
              services is  proposed for these processes.  This interface is based on formal
              representations  of process-related constraints expressed in terms of
              three-dimensional design  features with associated rules to ensure
              manufacturability.  The interface  specification will be build in collaboration
              with process developers at Stanford,  Carnegie Mellon University and other
              institutions, and will build upon emerging  standards for exchanging product
              specifications and representing manufacturing  processes.  In addition, the
              supporting communication infrastructure for  exchanging design features,
              constraints, process capabilities and manufacturing  analyses over the Internet
              will be developed.    A series of design exercises are also proposed.  The
              exercises will explore the  ability of designers to construct libraries of
              re-usable elements to be scaled  and miniaturized to take advantage of MEMS
              technology, and will explore the  feasibility of integrating designs and
              processes from different institutions to  create miniature electromechanical
              systems.
