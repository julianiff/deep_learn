Abstract    :
                9617623  Webb    This grant provides funds to complete development and improve
                performance of a broad band seafloor hydrophone system for   measurements in
              a band from 1 mHz to 64 Hz. The sensor is designed   for observations of
              Rayleigh waves and short and long period body   waves.  Presently, the noise
              level of the sensor does not reach   ambient noise levels at frequencies
              between 0.03 and 0.1 Hz.    Proposed work should provide improvements in noise
              level of up to   40 dB with new components that have become available. This  
              improvement in noise level will allow the detection of long period   body waves
              from smaller earthquakes, and improve the signal to   noise for seafloor
              observations of Rayleigh waves.  The enhanced   capability will make the new
              sensor an important tool for future   deployments of portable seafloor arrays
              or of a permanent ocean   seismic observatory.
