Abstract    :
              Hogan, Craig  AST 96-17036    Dr. Hogan will conduct research on two projects in
               observational cosmology.  The first project will measure  the abundance of
              deuterium in QSO absorbers as a test of  Big Bang nucleosynthesis and a
              measurement of the cosmic  baryon density, in particular, to resolve the
              present  dichotomy between high and low abundances.  The second  project will
              test cosmologies using Type Ia supernovae as  standard candles.  A large sample
              of Abell clusters will be  observed to discover a much larger sample of
              supernovae  than presently available on which to base a study of the  `flow'
              reported by Lauer and Postman, as well as to fill in  the linear part of the
              Hubble diagram.
