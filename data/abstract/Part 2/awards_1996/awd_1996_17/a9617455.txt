Abstract    :
              9617455  Johnson      This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project
              will   undertake to build an instrument capable of measuring heat flow   in the
              unsedimented, neo-volcanic regions of the sea floor. The    new heat flow
              instrument will be deployable from a surface ship,   and have the capability of
              transferring thermal flux data to the   ship in real time. Heat flow
              measurements at bare rock exposures   near mid-ocean ridge spreading centers
              have been shown to be   possible using a submersible, but these
              single-data-point   measurements are difficult to interpret, due to the
              variability   caused by sub-surface circulation of hydrothermal fluid. The  
              dense spatial coverage of heat flow data possible using the   proposed
              surface-ship deployable tool would allow us to move   beyond isolated single
              measurements. With a number of closely-  spaced heat flow stations at a ridge
              axis, it would be possible   to identify zones of diffuse fluid upwelling, make
              quantitative   estimates of the total heat of crustal formation in these areas,
                and determine how this energy is partitioned between convection   and
              conduction. While there is uncertainty associated with the   development of a
              heat flow blanket that is 'surface-ship   deployable', the potential benefit of
              being able to answer these   long-standing scientific questions is substantial.
