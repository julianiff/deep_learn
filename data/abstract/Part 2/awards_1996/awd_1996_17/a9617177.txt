Abstract    :
              van Gorkom, Jacqueline  96-17177    Dr. van Gorkom will investigate the
              evolution of  galaxies and the growth of large scale structure  by imaging the
              gaseous component of individual  galaxies in different environments and by
              mapping  out the distribution of gas-rich and possible  light-poor galaxies on
              larger scales.  Four  specific topics are included in this study -- the 
              environment of nearby Lyman alpha absorbers,  filaments in voids, the evolution
              of clusters of  galaxies and the end product of mergers.
