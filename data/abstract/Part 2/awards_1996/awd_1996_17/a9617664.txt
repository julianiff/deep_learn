Abstract    :
              Currently the size of primate groups is believed to be determined by the 
              density and distribution of food resources.  However, this model rests on a
              number of assumptions, and there are reasons to question the widespread
              acceptance of these assumptions.  For example, the model assumes that as group
              size increases, animals will have to travel further to find food. However,
              studies of leaf-eating monkeys find no such relationship.  The model also
              assumes that food resources are clumped, however some primates rely on
              resources that are quite dispersed.  It is unclear how this group size model,
              as presently developed, would apply to either of these situations.    We will
              conduct a 3-year study in Kibale National Park, Uganda to examine what
              determines the size of primate groups in three species that differ in their
              foraging strategies.  Based on previous three species of monkeys have been
              selected for study; one species for which the assumptions of the model are
              probably upheld (mangabeys - Cercocebus albigena) and two species for which the
              assumptions are violated (red colobus - Colobus badius rely on leaf resources
              which have been suggested to be non-depleting; and redtail monkeys -
              Cercopithecus ascanius rely on dispersed foods).
