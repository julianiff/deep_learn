Abstract    :
                The existing literature on dissident movements has not addressed the question
              of how rhetoric can be used to mobilize potential adherents to social
              movements.  This project hypothesizes that rhetoric takes place within
              particular communication `frames` and is more successful at mobilization when
              legal and political pressure increasingly is directed against the dissident
              group.  This research uses a content analysis of the Black Panther Party's
              newsletter (published weekly between 1967 and 1980) to determine the content of
              this dissident group's rhetoric.  These data are correlated with local, state
              and federal responses.  These data are estimated using standard econometric
              techniques.  The project sheds light on the circumstances under which
              authorities respond to attempts at political mobilization.  It sheds light on
              how dissidents recreate their rhetorical statements in response to actions by
              authorities.  Finally, it sheds light on the dynamic interaction between
              mobilization attempts and domestic political responses.
