Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9617257      The research objective is the determination of the
              structural, electronic, and catalytic properties of supported metal cluster
              catalysts during reaction.  Specifically, small clusters of Ir and Rh will be
              obtained by decomposition of organometallic precursors supported on magnesia,
              alumina and NaY zeolite.  They will be characterized gravimetrically, and with
              EXAFS/XANES, UV Laser Raman, and IR Spectroscopies, while catalyzing the
              hydrogenation of either propene, toluene or benzaldehyde.  In addition, the
              catalysts will be characterized ex-situ by the same techniques and by hydrogen
              chemisorption, TPD, TPR, and STM.   The results will help relate catalytic
              properties with cluster qize, structure and composition.  The data from
              clusters supported on different carriers will provide relationships between
              catalytic and electronic properties and other support-induced effects.  The
              fundamental properties to be determined from these quasi-molecular catalysts
              will serve to accelerate the development of catalytic science and technology as
              well as related areas, such as nanotechnology and sensor technology.
