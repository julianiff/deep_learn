Abstract    :
              The principal interdisciplinary task of this project is to place contemporary
              non-Archimedean mathematical theory within an historical and conceptual context
              - within an intellectual tradition in which certain conceptual problems have
              been posed and various historical attempts have been made to solve those
              problems. The project is concerned with the Robinsonian foundations of
              non-Archimedean analysis. Its purpose is  to relate non-Archimedean mathematics
              to its `archaeology, ` which is of considerable intrinsic historical importance
              and of conceptual significance for science studies.  Non-Archimedean
              mathematics holds out the promise of providing an exciting tool for analysis of
              a wide variety of classical conceptual problems of great historical
              significance in natural philosophy and the philosophy of mathematics.  It is
              important to investigate to what degree this promise can be fulfilled.  History
              has shown that such a contextualization of a formal theory can sometimes play a
              stimulating role in its further mathematical development as well as in the
              development of possible scientific applications of it
