Abstract    :
              9617291  Mead  This grant will help fund the attendance of a team of five women
              faculty and researchers at the the 10th International Conference of Women
              Engineers and Scienctists (ICWES), scheduled for October 8-10, 1996 in
              Budapest, Hungary.  The proposed travel team includes five women who are
              currently active in the development of strategies and examination of issues
              critical to the cultivation, participation and retention of girls and women in
              the fields related to science and engineering.  The theme and topics addressed
              at the ICWES are therefore important to the continued and future development of
              the each participant.  ***
