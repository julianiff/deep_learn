Abstract    :
              9617595  Getty    This project will attempt to develop U-Pb dating for shallow
              marine  carbonates (corals) between 1-10 million years old. Current dating 
              methods are inadequate in this time range; successful development  of the
              method will permit studies of carbonate bank evolution and  eustatic sealevel
              change under different climate conditions than  those of the present.
              Preliminary data on samples from the  Pinecrest Formation of Florida indicate
              large U/Pb ratios, rapid  production of 206Pb and age estimate accurate to
              about+ 100,000  years. The project will first examine a relatively young coral 
              using both the standard U.-series and the U-Pb techniques to  evaluate U-Pb
              initial conditions. Corals and molluscs from the  Pinecrest Formation will then
              be analyzed to test applicability  further.
