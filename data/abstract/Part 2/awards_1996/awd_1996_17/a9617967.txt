Abstract    :
              Smyth/Abstract  ATM-9616766         I propose to investigate the stability of
              properties of  barotropic, cirucular vortices in a stratified, rotating 
              environment.  This work will extend the results of Gent &  McWilliams (1986)
              beyond the quasigeostrophic regime.  I will  document the transition between
              scale-selective instability in the  quasigeostrophic regime and the
              castastrophic transitions to  turbulence which characterizes the unstratified,
              non-rotating case.   A number of vortex stability characteristics will be
              sought.  THe  proposed project is modest in scale, but should provide useful 
              information to the geophysical fluid dynamics community,  particularly with
              reference to the evolution of hurricanes and  tropical cyclones.
