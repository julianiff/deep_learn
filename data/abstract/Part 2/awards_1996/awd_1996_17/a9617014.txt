Abstract    :
              Walterbos, Rene  96-17014    Dr. Walterbos will study the shell structure in 
              galactic disks and their relation to the overall  structure of the interstellar
              medium in these  galaxies.  A key part of the study is to identify  shells
              using an algorithm which they have  developed and which has had demonstrated
              success.  By quantifying the numbers and properties of  expanding shells in
              different galaxies the  researchers will study how the interstellar medium 
              morphology may correlate with the local star  formation rate and under what
              conditions expanding  shells break out of the gas disk, allowing hot gas  to
              escape into the halo of the galaxies.
