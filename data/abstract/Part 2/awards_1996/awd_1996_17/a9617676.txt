Abstract    :
              >A DETAILED CHEMICAL AND ISOTOPIC INVESTIGATION OF >MESOZOIC  ATLANTIC MORB (NSF
              OCE96-17676)  >  >       This is a proposal to conduct a detailed chemical  and
              Sr, Nd and Pb >isotopic investigation of  Mesozoic MORB  from the central and
              North  >Atlantic. Basalts from most of these drill sites have not  been
              investigated in >detail before, and samples from only  two drill sites have any
              isotopic  >data. The objective of the project is to expand our current 
              investigation >of the effects of global mid-Cretaceous plume  magmatism on the
              composition >of the oceanic upper mantle.  Data for Mesozoic Pacific MORB
              suggest that >the Pacific  upper mantle underwent rapid and widespread
              enrichment in  >highly incompatible elements and radiogenic Sr soon after  the
              initiation of >effusive plateau- and seamount-building  volcanism in the
              mid-Cretaceous >around 120 Ma. We wish to  constrain the magnitude and
              geographic extent of >this upper  mantle enrichment "pulse", as it will provide
              critical  >information on the nature of the widespread Cretaceous  intraplate
              >volcanism, and will allow us to test models  relating the origin of the
              >volcanic event to interactions  at the core-lower mantle or lower
              >mantle-upper mantle  boundaries.  >
