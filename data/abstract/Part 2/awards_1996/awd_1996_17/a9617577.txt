Abstract    :
              This grant provides continued support for a series of annual conferences on
              macroeconomics. The conference series is aimed at bridging the gap between
              frontier reserach in macroeconomics and policy analysis. Past conferences have
              made a significant contribution to the testing of empirical implications of new
              theories as well as the use of relevant theory to analyze policy issues of
              current interest. The conference series will continue to encourage the writing
              of empirically oriented papers by both established and promising young
              economists. In addition, the series will continue to serve as a forum for
              communication among economists from the different schools of macroeconomic
              thought. The annual conference volume has become a widely cited and influential
              research reference.
