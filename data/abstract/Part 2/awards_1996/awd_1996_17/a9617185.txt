Abstract    :
              Charlton, Jane  96-17185    Dr. Charlton will conduct two observing programs 
              with the new Hobby-Eberly Telescope.  The first is  a survey of Mg II
              absorbers, which focuses on  their statistical evolution relative to H I and 
              high ions.  The second is a study of the  kinematics of absorbers at higher
              resolution to  chart the evolution of low ionization gas  kinematics.  The
              results of this research are to  provide a first view of low ionization gas in
              the  high redshift universe, a statistical sample of  both low and high
              ionization absorption lines as a  basis of future studies and a database from
              which  high redshift Mg II absorbing galaxies can be  identified and followed
              up with imaging.
