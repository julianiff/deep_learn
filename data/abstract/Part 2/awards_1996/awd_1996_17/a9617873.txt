Abstract    :
              Distortion of Information During Decisions  Upon having made a choice between
              alternatives, individuals provided with additional information on the options
              are more likely to judge it as favoring  (disfavoring) the option they selected
              more (less) than individuals who have not made a choice yet.  This tendency to
              interpret information in a manner consistent with ones choices and decisions is
              often attributed to individuals' desire to minimize cognitive dissonance.  In
              recent experiments conducted by the PI and co-authors, they find that this same
              type of distortion occurs even before an alternative has been selected.  In
              essence, the fact  that an alternative is judged preferable on the basis of an
              initial piece of information about the various alternatives (e.g., x is less
              expensive than y) biases the interpretation of additional information on the
              alternatives in favor of that option.  To the extent that a choice has not been
              made yet or is not requested, this bias in the interpretation of information
              cannot be attributed to a desire to minimize cognitive dissonance.  The PI
              outlines a series of experiments to further probe the nature of this bias in
              information evaluation, attempt to identify its underlying cause or causes,
              evaluate its prevalence in natural decision making environments and explore
              possible means of ameliorating the tendency.
