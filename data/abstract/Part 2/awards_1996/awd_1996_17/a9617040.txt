Abstract    :
              This project connects Florida Memorial College to the Internet over a T1 (1.544
              million bits per second) line.  Faculty and students at the school benefit from
              access to the resources of the Internet, including libraries and
              supercomputers.  In addition, they are able to communicate and collaborate with
              colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of research and educational
              projects.  The award provides partial support of the project for two years.
