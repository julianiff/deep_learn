Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at University of Wyoming to acquire an
              upgrade of a Siemens P3 X-  ray diffractometer to the P4 model. This equipment
              will enhance research in a number of areas  including the following:
              (1)structural investigations of fluoroalkylphosphine complexes, (2)  structural
              and reactivity correlations in iron nitrosyls, (3) Diels-Alder reactions within
              vesicles  and the aggregate morphology of novel surfactants, and (4) structural
              studies of nitrogen  oxyanions and luminescent molecular rectangles.      The
              X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise measurements of the
              full three  dimensional structure of a molecule. The information obtained gives
              the precise values of all the  bond distances and bond angles of a given
              molecule and it gives accurate information about the  spatial arrangement of
              the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
