Abstract    :
              9617031  Keszler    The objectives of this work are to prepare and study new 
              inorganic solids that will function as nonlinear optical  (NLO) materials or as
              hosts for laser and other luminescent  ions and to develop an understanding of
              the factors that  control physical properties.  Optical and thermal 
              properties, ionic conductivity's, and crystal structures of  a new family of
              noncentrosymmetric aluminum borates will be  examined.  The generation of new
              silicate fluorides  containing alkaline-earth metal atoms will provide 
              opportunities to realize new hosts having unique oxoanion  oxide environments
              for substitution of luminescent ions.  A  detailed understanding of the
              relationships between crystal  structure and optical emission characteristics
              of the  gallium and indium ions will be developed through optical, 
              photoconductivity, and nuclear magnetic resonance studies of  several doped and
              stoichiometric compounds in powder and  single-crystal form.  %%%  The focus of
              this project is on the preparation and  characterization of novel, crystalline
              inorganic materials  that exhibit nonlinear optical properties or have the 
              potential to function as hosts for luminescent ions,  including ones that can
              be induced to laser.  The design and  synthesis of materials with the ability
              to manipulate light  is important in a variety of endeavors, including 
              telecommunications, medical applications of lasers,  collision avoidance
              systems for automobiles, and military  systems.  ***
