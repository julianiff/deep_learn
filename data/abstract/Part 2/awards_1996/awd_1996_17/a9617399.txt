Abstract    :
              9617399  Jones    This planning grant will engage the QEM Network in identifying
               strategies and making recommendations to NSF on increasing the pool  of
              minority candidates for science and mathematics teachers.   Specifically, QEM
              will work with the Presidential Awards for  Excellence in Science and
              Mathematics Teaching.  They will examine  the recruiting and selection process,
              and identify key  organizations and individuals who can assist in enlarging the
               diversity of the applicant pool.  They will develop a database of  principals,
              department chairs and other school officials in  predominantly minority school
              districts that can provide  assistance.  Successfully identified strategies and
              the database  can be disseminated to all teacher enhancement projects.
