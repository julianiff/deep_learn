Abstract    :
              9617857  Croft    The three-year project will design, develop, test, and publish
              a CD-ROM based supplemental module for middle school grades on astronomy that
              focuses on learning about the solar system. The project will adapt the software
              tools developed for an earlier high school project - "Astronomy Village:
              Investigating the Universe" - for use with the new topic and grade level. NASA
              supported the development of the high school materials and is supporting a
              second phase of the high school project to develop assessment procedures and
              evaluate the impact of the high school materials. The middle school project
              will develop 10 new investigations focusing on planetary science and the solar
              system. With the materials, students will conduct background research,
              undertake related hands-on activities, simulate collecting data, analyze data
              making use of image processing technology, interpret the results of their
              analysis, and report their results to their peers. The project will publish and
              disseminate 5,000 copies of the software and teacher guide through the NASA
              Classroom of the Future.
