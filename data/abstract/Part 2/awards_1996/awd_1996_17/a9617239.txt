Abstract    :
                  The University of La Verne requests support from NSF to connect a branch
              campus and an off campus center to the Internet.  The Woodland Hills Campus is
              located about 53 miles from the home campus with about 325 full time students,
              the Orange County Center is about 40 miles from the main campus and has about
              415 full time students.  These distributed sites need the Internet  connection
              to be able to access information resources throughout the state, the nation and
              the world.  The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of these
              institutions as well as the community in general.  The award provides partial
              support of the project for two years.
