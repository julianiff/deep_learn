Abstract    :
              961799  Fohlin    The purpose of this project is to provide new evidence on the
              role of universal banks in Germany during the nineteenth and early twentieth
              centuries, and, more generally, to shed light on the ability of financial
              intermediaries to promote economic growth and development in the modern
              context.  Economists and historians have long suggested that financial
              institutions play a vital role in industrial development, and the German
              universal banks of the Kaiserreich (1871-1914) are often singled out as the
              prime example.  These banks joined short-term commercial lending with long-term
              investment banking and are thought to have fostered long-term relationships
              with the industrial firms they financed.  By combining functions and developing
              close ties with industrialists, German banks are  thought to have improved the
              efficiency and strength of investment and, in turn, to have accelerated
              industrialization.  The hypothesis underlying this study is that many of the
              characteristics considered integral to the German banking paradigm emerged well
              after the main spurt of industrial growth and that the corporate finance system
              taking the German form was neither sufficient nor even necessary for
              industrialization.  By examining the German case in detail, and by drawing
              international and intertemporal comparisons at each stage, this study promises
              to yield a wide range of insights into questions of both modern and historical
              relevance.
