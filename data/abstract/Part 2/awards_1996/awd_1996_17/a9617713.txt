Abstract    :
              9617713  Loubere    This project will reconstruct the geographic and temporal
              patterns  of surface ocean production in the eastern equatorial Pacific over 
              the past 150,000 years. Reconstructions will be based on a  relationship
              between taxonomic assemblage of benthic foraminifera  and surface production
              determined by factor and regression analysis  using modern material. The
              project will expand on existing work  which indicates regionally complex
              gradients in productivity over  time, with significant differences from trends
              inferred using  geochemical indicators of production.
