              Research Instrumentation: Multiprocessor Computing Facilities    This
              instrumentation grant enables the purchase of a Unix-based multiprocessor
              system to develop tools for analysis and development of parallel and
              distributed programs.  The project includes a study of parallel implementation
              of protocols, development of coordination abstractions that capture common
              patterns of process interaction in various applications, empirical evaluation
              of parallel flow analysis algorithms, development of an implementation testbed
              for distributed and shared memory programs, and development of a general
              parallel hydrologic routing system for hydraulic and hydrologic analysis of
              dams.    The multiprocessor system requested will be used to evaluate the
              performance benefits of parallelism in the analysis algorithms and as a part of
              a network configuration to evaluate the performance of network/distributed
              protocols and the throughput gains achieved by their parallel implementations.
