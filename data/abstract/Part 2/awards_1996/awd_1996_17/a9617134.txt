Abstract    :
                                        ABSTRACT                DBI-9617134  Harris    This
              award provides support for a small workshop to consider  the implications of
              changes underway in institutions of  higher learning of all types, especially
              as they have  implications for research and education in the biological 
              sciences.  These changes reflect changes in the relationship  of government and
              academic institutions and, in turn,  changes in the perceptions of the
              institutions and their  faculty as they view of their own roles in society. 
              Although such change is normal and healthy, increasingly the  impetus for
              change comes from lack of growth in support for  faculty research by Federal
              agencies, increased emphasis on  teaching by the largest institutions, and
              changing patterns  of employment among graduates.  The effects of these changes
               on  institutional policy and practice, and their  implications for Federal
              agencies that fund research and  education in the biological sciences will be
              explored.
