Abstract    :
              9617468  Zimmie    Long term monitoring of two existing landfills will continue 
              under this  Small Grant for Exploratory Research, representing a unique 
              opportunity to  obtain long term information about landfill performance. 
              Laboratory and  field work will include study of frost penetration, freeze- 
              thaw effects,  hydraulic conductivity changes, and settlement in the cover 
              materials,  especially the impermeable barrier layers.    Much attention has
              been given to date on the performance and  constructability of barrier systems
              beneath landfills, but  to date few  covers have been installed so that their
              performance has not  been  evaluated.  This is critically important because,
              while the  landfill lining  systems are notoriously redundant in design,
              landfill covers  are not  redundant as presently envisaged.  In particular,
              this  research addresses  the possibility that improved performance and reduced
              costs  for covers can  be achieved by the use of unconventional materials, e.g.
               waste paper  sludges.  ***
