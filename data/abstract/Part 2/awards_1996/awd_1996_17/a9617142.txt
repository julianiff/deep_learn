Abstract    :
                Woodbury College requests support from NSF to connect it's campus to the
              Internet.  Woodbury College, located in Montpelier, VT has approximately 143
              non-traditional adult students.  This independent institution offers degrees
              and certificates in  several social works areas.  The college intends to
              connect through Plainfield Bypass, a local Internet service provider. The
              campus needs the Internet connection to be able to access information resources
              throughout the state, the nation and the world.  The connection will benefit
              the faculty, staff students of this institution as well as the community in
              general.  The award provides partial support of the project for two years.
