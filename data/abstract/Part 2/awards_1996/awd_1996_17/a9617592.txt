Abstract    :
              The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Valerie Walters of  
              Lafayette College in her research studies on the triplet states of  
              halogenated porphyrins using phosphorescence, triplet-triplet absorption   and
              transient resonance Raman spectroscopies.  The overall goal of these   studies
              is to investigate the effect of various halogen substituents in   the
              beta-pyrrole and phenyl ring positions on triplet state geometry,   electronic
              structure and lifetime.   Semiempirical calculations will also   be carried out
              to aid in the spectral analysis.       Porphyrins have long been used as
              catalysts in oxidation and   photooxidation reactions.  Recent work has found
              that halogen (chlorine,   bromine, fluorine, iodine) substituents substantially
              increase the   stability of porphyrin catalysts.  Thus, much experimental and  
              computational work has been performed to investigate the effect of   halogens
              on the properties of the porphyrin electron ground state.    However, very
              little work has been carried out on the excited (triplet)   state properties,
              despite the fact that porphyrins are widely used   triplet state
              photosensitizers for singlet oxygen.   These studies will   make a significant
              contribution to our understanding of the energetics of   this increasingly
              important class of molecules.
