Abstract    :
              Knap  9617785  It is proposed to continue the now 41 year long time series  of
              the deep (3000 m)  ocean hydrographic station near Bermuda known as Station S 
              or the Panulirus  Station. Data collected to date have used by investigators 
              in several disciplines  to examine fluctuations at periods from weeks to
              decades in  the western Atlantic  Ocean. This continuous and on-going data set
              has proven to  be an important  link in global ocean monitoring for both
              climate research  and for evaluating  temporal changes of many parameters.
