              new international, including regional, research institutions and mechanisms for
              global change research.     A major international focus will be the work of the
              International Group of Funding Agencies for Global Change Research (IGFA). 
              IGFA is presently addressing issues such as arrangements for support of
              international project offices (IPO's) for global change research projects;
              refining its initial assessment of reservations and data management required
              for global change research;  observations and data management required for
              global change research; and needs and potential opportunities for cooperation
              between research funding and development aid agencies in support of global
              regional activities such as those of the International Research Institute for
              Climate Prediction (IRI); Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research
              (APN); and European Network for Research in Global Change (ENRICH).  ***
