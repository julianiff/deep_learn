Abstract    :
              The American mental hygiene movement was a reformist movement characteristic of
              the Progressive Era that sought to develop and apply psychiatry, psychology,
              and social work to alleviate the problems of modernity.  Its advocates defined
              mental health as the individual's adjustment to the social environment.
              According to its perspective, social problems could be solved either by
              increasing the adaptive skills of individuals or through social engineering. 
              In this Ph.D. dissertation, the researcher investigates the interaction between
              these ideas, professional intervention strategies and practices, and cultural
              ideas about what constitutes mental health.  The institutional basis for the
              mental hygiene movement was the National Committee for Mental Hygiene, which
              was founded in 1909.  The NCMH coordinated professional activities, maintained
              connections with large philanthropies to organize funding, and disseminated its
              perspective within the professions and society at large.  The interests of the
              NCMH moved from a concern with mental illness to its prevention; then the
              broadening of the scope of prevention to include social maladjustment; and
              finally, the promotion of adjustment or mental health.  These ideals of mental
              health both reflected cultural ideals of masculinity, citizenship, and
              normality, and reinforced them by their presentation in the neutral language of
              science and through the professional practices it developed.
