Abstract    :
              9617307  Cottrell, Garrison W.  Charles Elkan,  University of California, San
              Diego    CISE Research Instrumentation: Active Learning for Text, Scene, and
              Biosequence Analysis     Adaptation to changing environments and changing goals
              through autonomous learning is a central theme of research in the artificial
              intelligence laboratory at UCSD.  The workstations, robots, and neural network
              hardware acquired through this grant will enable recently developed learning
              methods to be tested in four large-scale, real-world applications.-Learning
              Semantic Representations for Information Retrieval-Embedded Virtual
              Agents-MEME: A New Software Tool for Sequence Analysis-Real Time Face and
              Object Recognition in Embedded Agents.  The first subproject will apply new
              algorithms for document rerepresentation and response to human feedback to
              gigabytes of text in the national TREC competition. Another project will port
              to the worldwide web software agents that learn and interact now in a simulated
              artificial life environment. A third project will scale up new software for
              finding patterns in DNA and protein sequences into a tool capable of
              autonomously analyzing entire genomes.  Finally, a fourth project will validate
              new active vision methods for recognizing and tracking objects by implementing
              these methods in mobile robots with controllable cameras.
