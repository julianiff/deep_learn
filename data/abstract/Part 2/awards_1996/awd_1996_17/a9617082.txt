              Abstract  ATM-9617082  Moore, Berrien  University of New Hampshire  Title:
              Global Analysis, Interpretation and Modeling (GAIM)    This award is directed
              toward the activities and office of the  Global Analysis, Interpretation, and
              Modeling Task Force (GAIM) of  the International Geosphere Biosphere Program
              (IGBP).  The GAIM  Office is housed in the Institute for the Study of Earth,
              Oceans,  and Space at the University of New Hampshire.  The Goal of GAIM is  to
              advance  the study of the coupled dynamics of the Earth system  using as tools
              both data and models.  The challenge to GAIM is to  initiate activities that
              will lead  to the rapid development and  application of a suite of Global
              Prognostic Biogeochemical Models.   These Global Biogeochemical Models would
              subsequently be linked,  partly through hydrological coupling, to General
              Circulation  Models, thereby providing models of the Earth system.  In order to
               make progress toward its goal, the Task Force must analyze current  models and
              data, interpret the capability of current models and  experimental programs
              against the demands for knowledge, and the  advance and synthesize our
              understanding of the global  biogeochemical cycles and their links to the
              hydrological cycle and  more generally to the physical-climate system as a
              whole.  This  award supports workshops, pilot modeling experiments such as
              inter-  comparisons, and base-level support of the GAIM Task Force Office.
