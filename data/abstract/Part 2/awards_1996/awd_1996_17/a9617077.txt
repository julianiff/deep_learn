              PROPOSAL ABSTRACT      Proposal Number:  9617077   P.I.:  Banchoff, Thomas F.   
              Institution:  Mathematical Association of America    Proposal Title: 
              "Communications in Visual Mathematics":  An Interactive      Hypertexted
              Electronic Journal     Abstract:  Recent advances in information technology,
              especially in interactive computer graphics and hypertext publication, offer to
              the mathematical profession opportunities to develop new ways of communicating
              expository and research mathematics, particularly in areas that involve
              sophisticated visualization techniques and multi-level non-linear documents. 
              This proposal outlines a two-year experiment aimed at developing an electronic
              journal, "Communications in Visual Mathematics:, for eventual inclusion among
              journal publications of the Mathematical Association of America.  The project
              will explore issues relating to electronic publication, with particular
              attention to geometric visualization, and it will work toward providing
              mathematical authors with tools and procedures for producing interactive
              hypertext documents for such a journal.
