Abstract    :
              9617989  Winship    The racial composition of U.S. prisons has gone from being
              less than 25% black sixty-five years ago to being approximately 50% black
              today.  This has occurred  along with  the substantial improvements in the
              social and economic status of blacks over this same period.  Little research
              has been done to explain why this change has occurred.  This research will
              examine this change in the racial composition of  U.S. prisons through studying
              factors which might have impacted it.  The investigator proposes to more
              thoroughly and rigorously test the importance of factors examined in prior
              studies of increases in crime among blacks (i.e., regional migration,
              differential population growth, urbanization, "the war on drugs,"  increases in
              female-headed households, black youth unemployment and the decline in
              manufacturing).  The investigator will create an integrated data base using
              information from the 1940-1990 U.S. Census PUMS data sets and the U.S.
              Department of Justice, Uniform Crime Reports Arrest Data from 1960-1990.  A
              process model for imprisonment will be developed and components of this model
              will be estimated using Poisson regression methods.    ***
