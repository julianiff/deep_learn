Abstract    :
              9617410  Willis  This award to Oregon State University will provide a
              echosounder with subbottom profiling capability and an ion chromatograph for
              study of seawater chemistry for use on R/V Wecoma, a research vessel operated
              by Oregon State University as part of the University National Oceanographic
              Laboratory System research fleet. The shared-use instrumentation supported here
              will assist marine scientists conduct studies, particularly in  the Northeast
              Pacific Ocean, in 1997 and in future years.  ***
