Abstract    :
              Bechtold, Jill  AST 96-17060    Dr. Bechtold will continue several programs to
              study the  nature of distant quasars and the intergalactic and  interstellar
              gas which lies along the line-of-sight to  them.  Observations will be in
              multiple wavelengths,  including optical, near-infrared, sub-millimeter, radio
              and  X-ray.  The continuum radiation provides clues to the  physical conditions
              of the supermassive black hole and  accretion disk.  The emission lines provide
              further clues  to the geometry and radiation field near the nucleus.  By 
              studying the quasars as a function of redshift, the  evolution of the quasar
              population as a whole may be  understood.
