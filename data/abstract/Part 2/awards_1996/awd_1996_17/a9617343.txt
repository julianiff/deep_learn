Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9617343    ROTHROCK, David  University of Washington    This
              project involves the dual civilian-military use of a US Navy nuclear submarine
              for the multi-agency project SCICEX (Science Experiment).  SCICEX researchers
              will use an upward looking sonar to examine the underside of the Arctic pack
              ice to determine the thickness variability of the ice in the Beaufort Sea.  The
              thickness information will be gathered at the site of a large,
              interdisciplinary research project, Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA)
              Ocean.  The variability of the ice thickness in conjunction with the ice,
              atmosphere, ocean measurements for SHEBA will be used to test a model that will
              allow the prediction of sea ice thickness from satellite measurements so that
              the results may be extrapolated to the entire Arctic Ocean.  The project is a
              very important contribution to a wide array of research efforts to determine if
              a proposed global warming will affect the Arctic ice pack thickness and
              distribution.  Global Circulation Models suggest that the ice pack may not be a
              permanent feature and this project will provide measurements that are necessary
              to validate and improve the models.
