Abstract    :
              Ellingson, Erica  AST 96-17145    Dr. Ellingson will investigate the effects of
              cluster  environment on the star formation and AGN activity of  galaxies at
              intermediate redshifts.  The first project is a  detailed spectroscopic and
              photometric study of 12 galaxies  to determine whether gas stripping or galaxy
              interactions  is the dominant physical mechanism for galaxy evolution in 
              clusters.  The second project is to investigate the effects  of cluster
              environment on AGN activity in cluster cores.  Imaging surveys and
              spectroscopic observations will confirm  the association of quasars to host
              clusters and determine  physical properties such as velocity dispersion, gas 
              content and interaction rates.
