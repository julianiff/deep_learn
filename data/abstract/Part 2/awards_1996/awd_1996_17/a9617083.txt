Abstract    :
              Ferland, Gary  96-17083    Dr. Ferland will continue to improve the large- 
              scale code called Cloudy, which computes the  spectrum of gas in
              photoionization or collisional  balance, and will apply it to a number of
              problems  in nebular astrophysics.  Cloudy requires updates  which reflect
              advances in the atomic data base  which it uses and improvements in the
              numerical  and computational methods used in the simulation.  The code will be
              tested on ablating molecular  clouds, the likely origin of some gas in quasars.
               For quasar studies the first step is to deduce the  composition of their
              emitting gas from the  spectrum, then to determine the dependencies of  this
              spectrum on the shape of the ionizing  continuum and to correlate this with
              observed  changes in the spectral energy distribution.
