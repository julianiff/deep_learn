Abstract    :
              9617196  Hou, Chao-Ju Jennifer  Han, Ching-Chih  Ohio State University    A
              Myrinet Testbed for Research in Distributed Real-Time Environments    The
              instrumentation grant will fund several Sun SPARC stations, one 8-port and
              seven 4-port Myrinet switches and host interfaces, and two software licenses
              for Open-Invention visualization to support distributed real-time system
              research in Computer and Information Science and Engineering.  The equipment
              will be used by five research projects, including     - Design and
              implementation of a load sharing mechanism;   - Application of
              distance-constrained task model to message scheduling;   - Design and
              implementation of a fast restoration mechanism;   - Design and implementation
              of multisensor integration algorithms that take advantage of load     sharing
              and real-time communication schemes; and    - Design and implementation of
              matching and scheduling algorithms, all in distributed  heterogeneous
              environments.    All projects are composed of two synergistic parts: 
              development of effective task management schemes, communication protocols, or
              multisensor integration algorithms based on a rigorous analytical foundation,
              and their validation with software system building and experiments.  The
              experimentation is essential, since a true evaluation of system performance can
              only be obtained through implementation and direct measurement.  The research
              instrumentation allows the construction of an inexpensive distributed real-time
              environment to conduct the work described.
