Abstract    :
              Merritt, David  96-17088    Dr. Merritt will conduct research with two goals. 
              The first is to understand the distribution of  dark matter in disk and
              elliptical galaxies  through its observed effects on the luminous  components. 
              The second is to determine the  importance of massive black holes for the 
              structure and evolution of galaxies, both through  theoretical studies and
              through a survey for  massive black holes in nearly galaxies using HST. 
              Studies of the formation and evolution of ealactic  disks are planned in
              addition to the two main  projects.
