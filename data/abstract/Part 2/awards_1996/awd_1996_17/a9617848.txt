Abstract    :
              OCE 96-17848  Flierl    The project will apply analytical and numerical models
              to  investigate the development of disturbances in oceanic  "jets" associated
              with western boundary currents such as the  Gulf Stream. Several dynamically
              important extensions to  existing work in the field will be investigated:
              Baroclinic  effects on jet stability will be addressed by including  realistic
              horizontal and vertical structures in the models.  The nonlinear evolution of
              the jet and of jet instabilities  will be considered in the presence of the
              mean flow  recirculation which surrounds the jet. Variations in the jet  and
              changes in the development of instabilities caused by  the proximity of a
              coastal boundary will be examined.
