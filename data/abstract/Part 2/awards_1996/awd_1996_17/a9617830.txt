Abstract    :
              With funds for a Small Grant for Exploratory Research from the Organic  
              Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor W. Grant McGimpsey   of
              Worcester Polytechnic Institute will carry our work relating to the   design,
              synthesis, and time-resolved photochemical evaluation of   relatively large,
              multichromophoric molecules which are candidates for   functioning as optically
              driven photonic and electronic wires.  The   novelty of this proposal is the
              use of a second laser pulse to excite a   metastable triplet formed in a first
              pulse. The chromophore on which   excitation ultimately resides will be
              accessible only following   absorption of the second photon, and thus
              absorption or emission which   requires that chromophore is a signature for the
              second photon.    The future of computation requires ever decreasing size and
              ever   increasing speed.  At some point molecular devices may become practical 
               and  well understood enough to be functional contributors to this goal.  
              Materials such as those being studied might eventually function as   molecular
              switches, potentially a component of future computers.  The   basic research to
              be done in this project lays the groundwork for both   materials and technique.
