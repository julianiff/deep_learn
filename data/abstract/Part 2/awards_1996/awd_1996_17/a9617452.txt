Abstract    :
              9617452  McNallan  Under an SGER award a study will be made of the feasibility 
              of directly forming diamond and diamond-like films on the  surface of metal
              carbides by selectively removing the metal  atoms in a corrosion reaction with
              halogen-rich atmospheres  at elevated temperature; this will be followed by
              suitable  heat treatment to allow the carbon atoms to form coherent 
              crystalline films.  After optimizing the processing  conditions the
              microstructure and mechanical and  tribological properties of the films will be
              determined.  ***
