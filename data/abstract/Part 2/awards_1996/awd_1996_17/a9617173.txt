Abstract    :
              Graham, James  AST 96-17173    Dr. Graham will calibrate and apply infrared
              surface brightness  fluctuation measurements of galaxies as a cosmological
              distance  indicator.  The observational part of the study will use a  variety
              of telescopes to calibrate the method on nearby galaxies  and then observe
              distances two to three times farther than  before, as far as the Coma cluster. 
              The theoretical portion of  the research will use stellar population models to
              investigate  the predicted behavior of infrared surface brightness 
              fluctuations and to compare them with observations.
