Abstract    :
              9617570    Marotske    In this project, the PI will estimate the climatological
              annual  cycle of the Indian Ocean from hydrographic and altimetric data. 
              Observations will be synthesized using an Ocean General  Circulation Model
              (OGCM), and the adjoint of the OGCM will be  used to drive the model towards
              the data.  The PI's previous  results have created a controversy about the
              strength and depth  of the overturning in the Indian Ocean, and even whether or
              not  it occurs.  Some of this is a result of the boundary conditions  used by
              the PI.  Approaches to resolving this controversy are  included in this work.
