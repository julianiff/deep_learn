Abstract    :
              9617209  Bollens    The  purpose of this project is to quantify predation 
              mortality  on four   target   organisms   (cod  and haddock  larvae,   Calanus
              finmarchicus,  Pseudocalanus  spp.) by  fishes  and  zooplanton  on Georges
              Bank.  The principal  objectives are:  1) to determine bankwide  distribution 
              and  abundance of vertebrate  and  invertebrate predators,  including  the
              identification  of  source  regions  for  predator  populations which are off
              the Bank; and  2)  to  quantify diet  and feeding rates based on stomach
              content  analysis  and  gut evacuation rates.  ***
