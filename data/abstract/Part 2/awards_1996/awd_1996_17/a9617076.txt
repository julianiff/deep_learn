Abstract    :
                  This project connects Trinity College to the Internet over a 56kbps line. 
              Faculty and students at the school benefit from access to the resources of the
              Internet, including libraries and supercomputers.  In addition, they are able
              to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit
              of research and educational projects.  The award provides partial support of
              the project for two years.
