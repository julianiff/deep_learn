Abstract    :
              Los Angeles Pierce College requests support from NSF to connect it's campus to
              the Internet.  The College, located in the western San Fernando Valley has
              approximately 15,000 students.  The college intends to connect through NETWAY a
              local Internet  service provider used by all the colleges in the district.  The
              campus needs the Internet connection to be able to access information resources
              throughout the state, the nation and the world.  The connection will benefit
              the faculty, staff students of this institution as well as the community in
              general.  The award provides partial support of the project for two years.
