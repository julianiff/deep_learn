Abstract    :
              Frederick Community College requests support from NSF to connect it's campus to
              the Internet.  Frederick Community College, located in Frederick, MD has
              approximately 4,400 students.  The college intends to connect through IISNET,
              the County government's Interagency Information System Network which serves as
              their local Internet service provider.  The campus needs the Internet
              connection to be able to access information resources throughout the state, the
              nation and the world.  The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students
              of this institution as well as the community in general.  The award provides
              partial support of the project for two years.
