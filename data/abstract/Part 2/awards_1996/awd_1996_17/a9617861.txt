Abstract    :
              University of Illinois Chicago            When Just Procedures and Outcomes
              Conflict:  A Value Pluralism Model of Justice  The PI proposes to investigate a
              model of justice which integrates the two social  psychological theories of
              procedural and distributive justice.  The central tenets of the  PI's theory
              are (1) when just outcomes are ambiguous, people's sense of justice will be
              determined by the perceived fairness of the procedures; (2) when just outcomes
              are clear, people's sense of justice will depend on whether these outcomes are
              achieved.  The PI's hypotheses will be tested in a two-stage telephone survey. 
              During the first stage the respondents will be queried about their stance on
              three controversial issues and the  perceived importance of these issues. 
              Three weeks later the respondents will be asked about their perceived fairness
              of laws affecting these issues.
