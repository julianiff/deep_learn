Abstract    :
              Willick, Jeffrey  96-17188    Dr. Willick will conduct research on the subject 
              of large-scale deviations from uniform Hubble  expansion.  These peculiar
              velocities are thought  to be due to anisotropic gravitational forces that 
              arise as matter in the universe becomes  increasingly clustered over time. 
              Thus, they can  be used to test models of the formation of large-  scale
              structure.  Coherent peculiar motions over  volumes many tens of megaparsecs in
              diameter are  indicative of mass density fluctuations over  comparable or
              larger scales.  These mass  fluctuations must be shown to be consistent with 
              angular fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave  Background radiation if the
              standard Big Bang  model is to remain internally consistent.  The  peculiar
              velocity field within the local universe  can be mapped in sufficient detail to
              compare with  theoretical predictions based on redshift survey  data and thus
              provide strong constraints on the  cosmological density parameter.
