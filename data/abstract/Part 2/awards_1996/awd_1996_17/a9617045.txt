Abstract    :
                This project is designed to extend investigations of viral diversity and the
              magnitude and variability of bacterial and algal mortality due to viral attack
              in the Arctic Ocean.  The PI proposes to extend these studies with emphasis on
              sea ice microbial communities for comparison with the underlying sea water. 
              Collection, fixation, and concentration of melted sea ice samples will be
              accomplished at sampling sites by deployment from US Navy submarine. 
              Subsequent analyses will be conducted in the laboratory.  Total counts of
              viruses and the frequency of viral infection in phytoplankton and bacteria in
              sea ice and seawater will be determined by electron microscopy on fixed
              samples.  To examine natural community diversity, concentrates of viruses will
              be purified and subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to separate viral
              DNA based on genome size.  From the number, positions, and staining intensity
              of different bands, the PI will estimate the diversity, genome sizes, and
              abundance of viruses in each sample.  Through coordination with other
              researchers, the PI will relate viral abundance, the frequency of viral
              infections, and viral community diversity to hydrographic and biological
              variables to determine those which may be important in regulating viral
              propagation in arctic sea ice and seawater.
