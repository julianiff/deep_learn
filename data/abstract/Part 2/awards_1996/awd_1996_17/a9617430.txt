Abstract    :
              9617430  Martin    Dissolution of CACO3 will be measured in marine sediments of
              the  eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean and western north Atlantic  continental
              rise.  The study areas have key characteristics for  extending understanding of
              CaCO3 dissolution: (1) the range in  saturation of bottom waters with respect
              to calcite, from CO32-=28  to =40, includes both substantial undersaturation --
              ideal for  constraining parameters in dissolution models -- and 
              supersaturation, which is essential for the direct measurement of  dissolution
              rates in sediments above the calcite lysocline; (2) the  values of the
              important, dissolution-controlling Corg : CACO3 ratio  in the material raining
              to the sea floor appear to be quite high,  in some areas exceeding 2.5 mol/mol,
              in contrast to other above-  saturation horizon regions that have been studied
              previously; (3)  the area includes both a regions of high sediment O2 demand
              (the  Cape Verde Plateau and western N. Atlantic margin) and one of lower 
              demand, typical of non-upwelling, pelagic areas ( the Sierra Leone  Rise); (4)
              the Sierra Leone Rise has been the site of extensive  sedimentological and
              paleoceanographic investigation, resulting in  a substantial set of ancillary
              data for the analysis of organic  matter oxidation and CaCO3 dissolution, and
              allowing evaluation of   the sedimentological indicators to above-saturation
              horizon  dissolution; and (5) the study areas include high flux sites with  low
              to moderate %CaCO3 (W.N. Atlantic margin) and with high %CaCO3  (Cape Verde
              Plateau, allowing evaluation of this factor as an  explanation for
              discrepancies in dissolution rates measured by pore  water and benthic chamber
              techniques.  The examination of the  variability in sedimentary oxidation and
              dissolution processes over  the range of conditions on the sea floor is
              essential to accurate  interpretations of the sedimentary record and to
              model-based  predictions of the ultimate fate of anthropogenic CO2.
