               CISE Research Instrumentation: A Network of Workstations for High Performance
              Computing     This instrumentation grant funds the purchase of 8 UltraSPARC
              workstations and an 8-port Myrinet switch to set up a Network of Workstations
              (NOW) laboratory at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the
              Pennsylvania State University.  The NOW laboratory is to be used as the
              experimental platform for several research projects, including in particular
              the following four:   -Efficient Communication Support for a Network of
              Workstations   -High Performance Geographical Information Systems   -Index
              Caching on a Network of Stations   -Communication Characterization of Parallel
              Applications    The first project focuses on deriving efficient software
              mechanisms for providing low latency and high bandwidth communication for
              parallel applications.    The second interdisciplinary research project plans
              to develop a High Performance Temporal Geographical information System (GIS) on
              the NOW platform.    The third project proposes to examine database performance
              issues using a client-server architecture.    The last project aims at
              characterizing the communication behavior of parallel algorithms by direct
              execution of different applications, simulating several network architectures,
              and developing a faster execution-driven simulation environment on the NOW
              platform.
