Abstract    :
                  This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of
              NCRI's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers K-12
              education institutions (including vocational technical schools), public
              libraries and museums.  It provides partial support for two years for a cable
              modem network to connect the educational institutions in Jamestown ND to the
              Internet.  The schools include a high school, middle school, seven elementary
              schools, a vocational center and a center for children.  Jamestown College
              independently is upgrading its existing 56kbps Internet connection to T1 to
              handle the increased traffic.  The educational institutions and the local cable
              company have formed a partnership for this project, with leadership from the
              college.
