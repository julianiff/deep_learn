Abstract    :
              9617869  Rossby  This project is to develop a profiling current meter that   can
              operate from the surface to depths as great as 5000   meters. Called the
              EM-POGO, it is a merger of two well-  established techniques, the expendable
              current profiler   (XCP) and the dropsonde, also known as the POGO.  The XCP  
              technique yields the vertical structure of ocean currents to   a relative
              accuracy of  1-2 cm/s, and the dropsonde   displacement measures the vertically
              averaged velocity also   to about 1-2 cm/s. The complete instrument will weigh
              about   15 kg enabling it to be deployed by hand and hence used from   boats of
              any size. The appeal of the instrument lies in its   high accuracy, ease and
              speed of use, and low cost. These   attributes should lead to considerable
              interest in it for a   number of research applications.  The necessary
              technology   is well-known; the proposed work consists of adapting these   two
              techniques into one operating system.  The resulting   technology will be made
              available for commercial   fabrication.
