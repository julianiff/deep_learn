Abstract    :
                Nightingale  9617622  This research focuses on the factors that influence
              jurors' perception of child witnesses.  In particular, a child's age has been
              shown to influence jurors' judgments of the child's credibility.  Two pilot
              experiments are being conducted at this time.  The first is designed to explore
              the utility of using q-sort techniques for assessing adults' stereotypes of
              children of various ages.  In the second, adults will hear testimony of a
              child.  The age of the child will be manipulated.  The range of ages adults
              find believable will be evaluated.  The results of these pilot studies will
              inform the development of a complete proposal designed to advance scientific
              knowledge of stereotyping and of jurors' decision making.  %%%  This research
