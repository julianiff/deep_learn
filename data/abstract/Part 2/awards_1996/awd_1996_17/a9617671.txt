Abstract    :
              D Asaro  9617671  Turbulence is the upper ocean mixed layer will be examined by
              analyzing  recently collected data consisting of neutrally buoyant float
              trajectories in  both wind-driven and convectively-driven conditions,
              high-quality air-sea fluxes,  surface wave spectra and temperature/salinity
              profiles. In addition to following  the three-dimensional motion of water
              parcels, the floats also measure  temperature, stratification and vertical
              vorticity. From these measurements, both  Lagrangian and Eulerian profiles of
              Eckman velocity, turbulent kinetic energy and  its components, turbulent
              dissipation rates, rms horizontal and vertical  displacements will be
              calculated to see how they scale with surface fluxes and  surface wave
              properties. A numerical model will also be used to investigate the  use of
              Lagrangian floats for measuring heat flux and/or mixing rates.
