Abstract    :
              9617985    Nowlin    This award continues the cooperative agreement under which
              the  Project Office for the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) 
              operates.  The office provides US scientists with logistics and  travel support
              for planning meetings, workshops, and major field  expeditions, publishes a
              periodic newsletter, coordinates  activities with the International Project
              Office in the United  Kingdom, and serves as the central source of information
              on the  U. S. WOCE program.  WOCE will complete its final field phase in  the
              1998-1999 time frame, and this will be followed by an intense  phase of
              analysis, synthesis, and modeling which will continue to  require the
              coordination efforts of this office.
