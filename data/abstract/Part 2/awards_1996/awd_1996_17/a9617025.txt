Abstract    :
              This Ph.D dissertation concerns engineering design practices and the process of
              invention in large organizations.  Research is focused on the research,
              development, and engineering of antilock braking systems for passenger
              automobiles between 1953 and 1978.  The investigation centers on research and
              development conducted in the United States, Great Britain, the Federal Republic
              of Germany, and Sweden.  The international focus is designed to highlight the
              construction of a community of practitioners who spanned national as well as
              company lines.  Standard practices emerged within this community.  The main
              sources are several hundred published articles from professional journals and
              conference proceedings.  Of equal significance are several dozen interviews
              with participants.  The most important companies were located in Germany -
              Teldix, Robert Bosch, Alfred Teves, Mercedes Benz, and BMW.  Outside of 
              Germany - Lucas Industries of England, Kelsey-Hayes and Bendix in the U.S., and
              research institutes at U/Michigan, Penn State, Technical University at
              Braunschweig, and the Motor Industries Research Association and the Road
              Research Laboratory  in England, and the Staten vag-och trafikinstitut in
              Sweden. Support will provide travel expenses to conduct research in  Germany,
              England, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, and Washington, D.C.
