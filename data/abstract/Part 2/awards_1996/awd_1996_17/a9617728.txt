Abstract    :
              Dewar    OCE-9617728    The influence of bottom topography on the general
              circulation of the oceans will   be studied using numerical and analytical
              techniques. It is suggested that ridges   and plateaus of moderate scale may be
              sites where the unsteady wind-driven   circulation can penetrate into the deep
              ocean and may be associated with strong   local recirculation via eddy driving.
              The study will focus on three topics: (1) the   effects of large-scale
              topography on the mean circulation; (2) the time scales   introduced by both
              large and small-scale topography in a steadily forced   circulation; and (3)
              primitive equation model inversion to assess the importance   of the
              Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Azores Plateau on the circulation in the North  
              Atlantic sub-tropical gyre.
