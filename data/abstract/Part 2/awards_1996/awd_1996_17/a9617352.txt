Abstract    :
              9617352  Bennett  The Institute for Magnetics Research, Department of Electrical
              Engineering and Computer Science, School of Engineering and Applied Science at
              The George Washington University will purchase magneto-optical equipment which
              will be dedicated to support research and education.  The equipment will be
              used for several research projects, including:    A project to investigate
              linear and nonlinear magneto-optical properties of magnetic multilayers and
              nanocomposites, in collaboration with the Civil, Mechanical, and Environmental
              Engineering Department in the School of Engineering and Applied Science at The
              George Washington University.    A project to utilize the magneto-optical Kerr
              effect to analyze the magnetizing processes of such multilayers and composite
              materials by measuring the major and minor hysteresis loops of the surface
              magnetic layer of such materials that cannot be measured with our vector
              vibrating sample magnetometer.  This magneto-optical equipment will be used to
              investigate the properties of modern Preisach-based models of the magnetization
              process.  When used in a scanning mode, this equipment will permit direct
              comparisons of the magnetization pattern on the submillmeter scale with that
              computed using our micromagnetic models.    A project to utilize this equipment
              as a part of an advanced undergraduate laboratory electrical engineering
              course, and for a senior research project.  ***
