Abstract    :
              Buta, Ronald  96-17154    Dr. Buta will study the kinematics and dynamics of 
              resonance ring galaxies.  The research will  directly test the idea that rings
              are related to  resonances by obtaining 2-dimensional near-  infrared imaging
              of a substantial sample of ringed  galaxies.  This study should provide many 
              important insights into the nature of disk  instabilities in galaxies because
              the location of  corotation is crucial to determine both the  effectiveness
              with which angular momentum is  transferred to the outer regions of galaxy and
              the  ability of a spiral density wave to be maintained.
