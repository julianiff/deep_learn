Abstract    :
              This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of NCRI's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers K-12
              education institutions (including vocational technical schools), public
              libraries and museums.  It provides partial support for two years to connect
              two Seattle inner city elementary schools to the Internet and to use wireless
              techniques to allow ten roving laptops to be used within the schools.
