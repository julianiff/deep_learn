              Title:  Collective phenomena in semiconductor plasmas, wakefield generation and
              measurement- theory and experiment.      In this research,  fundamental
              investigations into condensed matter plasmas within semiconductors will be
              investigated.  The condensed matter counterparts of plasma waves, and wake
              fields, in doped III-V systems, will be generated using newly available
              ultrashort pulse laser techniques. Condensed matter plasmas are an
              underexplored phenomena.  The knowledge generated here may have great relevance
              to fundamental understanding of the behavior of bandgap-engineered structures,
              emission processes, and the behavior of materials in extreme environments.  It
              will also provide cross-fertilization as a condensed matter counterpart for
              emerging research in new extreme regimes of laser-plasma interactions in
              gaseous plasmas, which could provide synergistic insights.
