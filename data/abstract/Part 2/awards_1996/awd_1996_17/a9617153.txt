Abstract    :
              29617153  Cheng  The goals of the proposed research are to develop technologies
              in the fields of epitaxial  growth of strained quantum wire (QWR) structures by
              molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), multi-axial strain engineering, and computer
              modeling of low dimensional strained structures based on efficient
              band-structure models to make possible the fabrication of wavelength stable
              semiconductor lasers for optical fiber communication and information
              applications.  Specifically, we plan to fabricate wavelength stable 1.55
              (mGaxInl-xAs/InP and 0.98 (m GaxInl-xAsyP1-y/GaAs lasers which employ strained
              QWR active regions formed in situ by the strain induced lateral-layer ordering
              (SILO) process during MBE growth.  The stable wavelength results from a unique
              multi-axial strain generated in the QWR region by the SILO process.  It is
              expected that by using this multi-axial strain technique within a QWR
              structure, new quantum and optical effects will be observed which will in turn
              lead to novel devices with new functions and/or improved performance.  It is
              our vision that the completion of this research should lead to 1) new insight
              into innovative growth methods, 2) knowledge and control of multi-axial strain
              engineering, 3) an understanding of new physical effects in strained quantum
              wire structures and devices, 4) the development of new efficient modeling
              techniques, and 5) the physical realization of novel strained quantum wire
              lasers and devices with improved performance characteristics.  ***
