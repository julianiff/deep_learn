Abstract    :
              The chief challenge of our time is the intelligent control of technology, and
              nowhere is that challenge being more vigorously interpreted and debated than in
              the context of education. This project investigates the prospects for using
              technology to provide distance learning in ways that support traditional
              educational values. To achieve this aim, the study will focus on the design
              features of the Western Governors virtual university in relationship to the
              educational value of individualization. This analysis will be carried out using
              the incrementalist theory of technology development, primarily as espoused by
              David Collingridge.  Incrementalists stress that error should be expected in
              any technological development and the cost of error can be minimized by
              advancing technologies in a series of slow, small steps whose effects can be
              quickly recognized and easily modified. Trial and error, corrigibility,
              flexibility, and monitoring are thus key properties of manageable technological
              systems. The relevance of these concepts to information technology in higher
              education and their usefulness in guiding technological development in ways
              that serve educational values will be assessed.  Articles resulting from this
              project will be submitted to relevant journals in the humanities, social
              sciences and educational administration.
