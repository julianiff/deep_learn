Abstract    :
              Shaw  9617353  The award supports the Research Needs and Opportunities in
              Superconductivity Workshop to be held at the Monterey Marriott Hotel,
              Monterey,CA, February 10-12, 1997.  The objectives of the conference are: 1.)
              to review major advances in superconductivity R&D since the last workshop in
              1991; 2) to identify key problems that are bottlenecking progress; 3.) to
              specify areas where major breakthroughs appear possible; 4.) to identify new
              research facilities or techniques that may lead to new research opportunities. 
              The Conference plans to invite research leaders to discuss fundamental issues
              in superconductivity.  The workshop will be divided into four panels:
              fundamentals, materials, thin film and devices, and bulk superconductor, wires,
              and applications.  A proceeding will be put together by the Conference for the
              report. The P.I. and his colleagues have organized similar conferences in the
              past. The findings of the workshop would be able to provide NSF with 
              suggestions for research direction in the area of superconductivity materials
              processing in the future.
