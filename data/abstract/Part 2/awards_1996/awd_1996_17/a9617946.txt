Abstract    :
              McCartney  9617946  The secular variability in various components of the 
              meridional overturning  circulation of the North Atlantic and the linkages
              between  these components and  the variability in the overlying atmosphere will
              be examined  by using historical  oceanographic data. The work will address the
              question of  whether the decadal  trends in warm water transformation, which
              co-vary with the  low frequency North  Atlantic Oscillation, represent an
              oceanic response that is  passive, active or a  coupled interaction. This
              proposal is a contribution to the  CLImate VARiability  and predictability
              (CLIVAR) program.
