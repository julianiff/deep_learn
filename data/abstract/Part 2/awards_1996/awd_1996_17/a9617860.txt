Abstract    :
              9617860  Schrag    Previous work by the PI has shown that vertical profiles of
              the  oxygen isotope ratio in sediment porewaters reflect past changes in  ocean
              bottom water and can be used to separated the effects of  water composition and
              temperature upon isotopic signatures in  marine carbonates. Preliminary results
              suggest that bottom waters  and tropical sea surface temperatures during the
              last glacial  period were significantly colder than at present. The project
              will  analyze oxygen and hydrogen isotopes and C1 in sediment porewaters  from
              a global array sites to confirm the preliminary findings and  test for regional
              differences. Porewater diffusion models will be  developed further, and some
              initial attempts will be made at  applying the results to ocean circulation
              models.
