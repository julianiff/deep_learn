Abstract    :
              Lange, Andrew  96-17161    Dr. Lange will use measurements from the Sunyaev- 
              Zel'dovich Infrared Experiment (SuZIE) at the  Caltech Submillimeter
              Observatory to survey a  large sample of clusters of galaxies over a two-  year
              period.  The goals of the program are to  measure the peculiar velocity field
              of the  clusters, to measure the scale anisotropy of the  CMB, to determine a
              value for the Hubble constant  based on an unbiased sample of clusters, to 
              determine the number density of high redshift  clusters, and to characterize
              the confusion due to  unresolved sources in the CMB anisotropy  measurements.
