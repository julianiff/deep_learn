Abstract    :
                  9617555  McGraw   This research tests the feasibility of censusing forest
              tree populations using remote sensing for the broad purposes of inventory,
              projection of future population levels, and screening the forest for rare,
              endangered or otherwise unique individuals ('bioprospecting').  High resolution
              color and color infrared photographic images of mapped, forested plots will be
              collected with 35mm cameras in fifteen overflights for a period of one year. 
              Methods will be developed to automate the process of circumscribing individual
              tree canopies from scanned images.  New image processing approaches to identify
              individuals to species will be developed which rely on differential
              phenological development of species and differing spectral reflectance
              properties.  The ultimate goal of these techniques will be the censusing of
              populations of trees from remote imagery in a manner suitable for input to
              size-dependent matrix population models of forest tree population dynamics.  
              In the future, satellite-borne sensors will likely be capable of both high
              spatial and spectral resolution image capturing.  Population-level applications
              of remote-sensing are in their infancy.  If data from such sources can be used
              for forest inventory, population projection and 'bioprospecting', the studies
              made possible will have regional and global applicability to numerous serious
              environmental problems.
