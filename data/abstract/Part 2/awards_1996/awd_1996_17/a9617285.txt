Abstract    :
                Spaeth  9614000  Since 1989, the investigator has produced two major data
              bases on the U.S. Supreme Court.  The first, which is updated annually, relies
              exclusively on the published Reports of the Court's decisions.  The second
              includes unpublished conference votes and opinion assignments of the justices
              who served during the Vinson (1946-1952) and Warren (1953-1968) Courts.  This
              project will update and extend the previous work to encompass the Burger Court
              (1969-1986).  Inclusion of the Burger Court conference vote data will provide
              investigators with the complete voting record of each justice in every case in
              which a conference vote was cast during a 40-term period,. 1945-1986.  Analysts
              will have access to a standardized, highly reliable data file with which they
              may compare individual and Court voting across vote types, as well as voting
              changes of individual justices from one type of vote to another.  Because a
              raft of background, chronological, substantive, outcome, and opinion variables
              are associated with these votes, the richness of the resulting data will
              enhance the formulation of theory and the testing of hypotheses.    %%%  Since
