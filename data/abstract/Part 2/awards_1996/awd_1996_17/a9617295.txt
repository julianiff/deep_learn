Abstract    :
              9617295  Saatamanesh  This award provides support for the second "International 
              Conference on Composites in Infrastructure".  The Conference  will be attended
              by approximately 400 people from various  countries and will include
              presentations and discussions of  current and future research as well as
              discussions for  integrating advanced composites into the construction 
              industry.  Every effort will be made to create an atmosphere  for effective
              communications among participants from the  composite industry, construction
              industry, researchers,  practicing engineers, and regulatory agencies to pave
              the  way for the transfer of technology from the composite and  aerospace
              industries into the construction industry.  ***
