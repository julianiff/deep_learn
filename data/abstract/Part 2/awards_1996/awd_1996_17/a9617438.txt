Abstract    :
              9617438  Watson    This planning grant requests funding to enable a new
              alliance, the National Alliance of Presidential Awardees Associations (NAPAA)
              to design activities, develop a mission, and become an active advocate for
              excellence in mathematics and science teaching in the national arena.    NAPAA
              proposes to conduct four broad categories of activities:    1.  Survey to
              previous awardees.  The purpose of the survey is to determine current address,
              current position , and track experiences since the Awardee's selection.  2. 
              Organizational and Planning Meeting of NAPAA Executive Board.  This activity
              will permit the fledging organization to develop a mission, adopt procedures,
              and develop processes for identifying a Chief Executive Officer.  3.  Design an
              "event" that brings together current and past Awardees that is directed toward
              ongoing professional development.  4. Design an electronic database and Web
              Page for the NAPAA.
