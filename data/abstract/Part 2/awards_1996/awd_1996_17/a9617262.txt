Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to meld the intellectual and methodological
              approaches contained within neurobiology and anthropology and arrive at a new
              way of looking at an old problem, the origin of human speech/language and its
              neural substrate, during primate and early human evolution.  The working
              hypothesis is that the evolutionary substrate for brain mechanisms which
              underlie the unique human form of vocal-auditory communication was already
              present in our common ancestor with Old World monkeys if not much earlier. 
              Further, that this basal neural substructure was incorporated and further
              elaborated, when early human ancestors changed from the long-standing primate
              pattern of territorial containment to become wide ranging bipeds in a highly
              demanding, cognitive and communicative novel environment.    This project will
              use two modern neurobiologic techniques, 1) Magnetic Resonance Imaging with
              3-D, quantitative, computerized image analysis, to address outstanding issues
              of gross anatomic interhemispheric asymmetries in regions of great ape and
              monkey cerebral cortex that are homologous to human brain language areas; and
              2) Quantitative Immunocytochemistry to determine, in macaques, whether there is
              an asymmetric distribution of various brain chemicals in these brain regions
              that would lend support to the hypothesis of already well established
              hemispheric functional specialization.
