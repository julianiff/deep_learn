Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program continues support for research on synthesis of complex metal   oxides
              by Dr. Jon Zubieta of the Chemistry Department, Syracuse   University.  Organic
              components will be introduced using hydrothermal   methods to form unusual
              solids of four general types: microporous solids   with zeolite scale cavities;
              layered mixed-valence transition metal   oxides containing organo-ammonium
              cations; vanadium and molybdenum   oxophosphates containing covalently-bonded
              organic ligands; and vanadium   oxides containing  coordination complexes. 
              These open-framework and   layered structures will be prepared by
              low-temperature methods based on   the model of biomineralization. While
              systematic synthesis of such   materials has been elusive, the long-term goal
              of this research is to   enable `design` of two classes of metal oxides:
              layered and zeolitic   oxovanadium and oxomolybdenum phosphates and
              organophosphonates, and   layered and three-dimensional vanadium oxides and
              molybdenum oxides.  Metal oxide based solid phase compounds are important in
              catalysis,   sorption, molecular electronics, energy storage, optical
              materials, and   ceramics.  Variations in chemical composition and structure
              effect a wide   range of properties.  New synthetic approaches to introducing
              organic   groups are expected to result in compounds with an expanded range of 
               properties by compensating charge, directing structural growth, or  
              connecting functional groups.
