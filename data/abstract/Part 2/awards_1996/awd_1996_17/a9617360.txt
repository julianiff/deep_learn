              Instrumentation: Computational Techniques for Distributed Process Engineering  
                The grant supports equipment to enable research in the following projects:
              -Modeling and Large Scale Simulation, - Discrete and Nonlinear Optimization, -
              Process Control and Production Scheduling,- Synthesis and Verification of High
              Integrity Control Systems and Operating Procedures, -Information Systems and
              Distributed Data.  The chemical manufacturing industry in the US is facing the
              challenge of integrating process design and operation to respond to changes in
              technology, increased global pressures, new regulation and safety constraints.
              CMU has developed expertise and decision support systems that answer to a
              number such problems.  This research focuses on integrating the areas outlined.
               Models for efficient information storage and retrieval in large scale design
              problems are developed to enable more efficient methods for optimization and
              sequencing. Theory and computational tools will also be developed for exploring
              trade-off issues between design and control. The long term goal is to advance
              integrated strategies for decision support systems and efficient methods for
              coordinating symbolic and numerical computation for process design and
              operation in distributed computer networks.
