Abstract    :
              Kirshner, Robert  96-17058    Dr. Kirshner wishes to continue the scientific 
              analyses made possible by the completion of the  Las Campanas Redshift Survey. 
              The survey contains  26,418 reshifts of galaxies selected from a CCD-  based
              galaxy catalog covering 700 square degrees  and is the best data set for
              investigating many of  the aspects of the distribution of galaxies in the 
              Universe.  The list of topics includes measuring  the distribution of
              galaxy-galaxy velocity  differences, refining the estimates of the power 
              spectrum on scales over 100 Megaparsecs, studying  relations between galaxy
              spectra and galaxy  density, estimating cosmic density from kinematic 
              signatures in the velocity distributions and  seeking clues to the underlying
              dark matter from  the fluctuation spectrum of galaxies on the  largest scale.
