Abstract    :
              .  Project Summary:                   The purpose of this work is to demonstrate
              that a coordination process can improve group        decision making about
              shared goods. The long term goal of this research is to develop decision       
              making tools for use in a cooperative group setting, based on economic theory
              and experimental        economics testing.                   Groups in social,
              government, and business situations frequently have to decide on the       
              nature of a shared good and how its costs are allocated among group members. A
              garbage        facility shared among several counties is one local government
              example, and a shared computer        system among divisions in a firm is
              another. Our underlying thesis is that successful group        outcomes may be
              impeded by complexity of the group situation, particularly when there is       
              heterogeneity in group member types and the cost function is nonlinear. An
              exacerbating factor        is group size: in a large group, direct
              cornmunication among members to find a group optimum is        simply not
              possible. Equal cost sharing is frequently observed as a group outcome even
              when        group members differ in preferences, perhaps as a response to
              complexity. Voluntary        contribution has been shown experimentally to
              under provide shared goods. At worst, a group        simply may not be able to
              reach a decision on a voluntary basis.                   Our coordination
              process uses a specific algorithm tO find the group solution for the       
              shared good and its finance through cost sharing. Each group member sends the
              quantity        demanded as a signal to the coordinator in response to a price
              signal; the process repeats until a        stationary signal is obtained. Thus,
              the coordination process provides structured interaction        among group
              members and, more importantly, provides information signals for individual     
                decisions relative to the group that help guide the group to an equilibrium
              outcome. The        coordination process that we will test is based on the Cost
              Share Equilibrium which gives an        efficient group solution as a Nash
              equilibrium.                   The Quantity Adjustment Process has been given
              preliminary testing in an experimental        economics setting at the Economic
              Science Laboratory at the University of Arizona. In striking        contrast to
              other voluntary contribution experiments, group performance in terms of
              efficiency        improves with repetitions as group members learn about how
              the process works.                   The current project tests, using
              experimental economics techniques, coordination        (Quantity Adjustment
              Process) compared to a base case (Voluntary Bid) for a worst case       
              scenario: no communication and heterogeneity with a nonlinear cost function. We
              construct        a voluntary mechanism to parallel our shared good situation
              with a cost function. Results are        be used to compare statistically the
              improvement in efficiency provided by the coordination        process.
              Individual strategic behavior as related to type (endowment and reward) is also
                      investigated.
