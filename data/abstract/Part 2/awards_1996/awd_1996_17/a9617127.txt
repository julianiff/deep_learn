Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial
              support for two years for an OC-3 ATM Boston metropolitan area network and an
              OC-3 connection from that network to the vBNS.  Applications include:  *
              Traffic Controller Module for RSVP  * Providing End-to-end Quality of Service
              in an IP-over-ATM Network  * Metacomputing and Distributed Visualization  *
              Earthquake Physics  * Algorithms for Global Optimization, Enhanced Sampling and
              Reaction Pathway        Determination  * Modelling Excited State Chemical
              Dynamics  Collaborating institutions include the National Center for
              Supercomputing  Applications, University of Illinois at Chicago, Cornell,
              University of  California at San Diego, University of Colorado, Northeastern,
              MIT,  Syracuse University and the California Institute of Technology.
