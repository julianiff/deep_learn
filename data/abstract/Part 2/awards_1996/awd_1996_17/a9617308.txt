              Research Instrumentation: Prototyping Equipment for Application Specific
              Architectures    This research instrumentation grant enables two distinct
              research projects:   - Low Power, High Performance Architecture Design   -
              Massively Parallel, Application Specific Hardware System Design    The first
              project focuses on the design of low power, high performance hardware systems  
              for use in mobile applications.  This project includes the design of CAD tools
              which support the design of low power systems and the study of low power module
              and processor architecture alternatives.  A subset of the designs will be
              selected for fabrication, using the requested chip fabrication expenses, and
              evaluation, using a subset of the prototyping support equipment, to validate
              simulated speed and power consumption measurements.  The second project focuses
              on the design, implementation, and use of massively parallel, application
              specific hardware systems for signal and image processing applications.  A
              specific example is the MGAP-2 which is a single board coprocessor containing
              49,152 fine grain processors (on 32 custom VLSI chips).  Experience with the
              MGAP family of architectures has provided insight into derivative architectures
              which hold a promise of improved performance, flexibility, and/or physical
              size.  A subset of  these derivative designs will be implemented using the
              requested chip fabrication expenses, prototyping support equipment, and
              hardware prototyping accessories to validate their benefits.
