Abstract    :
              Robin Hochstrasser of the University of Pennsylvania is supported by the  
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his studies on   ultrafast
              dynamics in liquids.  Femtosecond (fs) laser spectroscopic   techniques will be
              brought to bear on two central themes:  solvent   control of chemical reactions
              and the relaxation of molecular   excitations.  Specific techniques to be
              developed include fs transient   infrared spectroscopy at low frequencies;
              terahertz spectroscopy to probe   low frequency motions in molecular pump-probe
              experiments; and fs   time-resolved X-ray scattering on liquid samples.  Focus
              is on   solvent-assisted uni- and bimolecular reaction dynamics and electronic 
               and vibrational relaxation.  Quantum chemical calculations of the   potential
              energy surfaces and classical molecular dynamics simulations   will also be
              carried out.    The study of the transformation of energetically excited
              molecules in   condensed phases from one molecular isomeric configuration to
              another   will significantly expand our knowledge of how a complex molecule  
              undergoes internal rearrangements and how these are mediated by a   surrounding
              solvent.
