Abstract    :
                PROJECT ABSTRACT  Modern economic theory is built on the assumption that all
              economic agents are completely rational, meaning that they always know what is
              best for them and never make mistakes.  Observed behavior however, is noisy and
              cannot be predicted precisely.  Small amounts of randomness at the individual
              level may have a large effect on economic outcomes when people interact. This
              project develops a realistic model of error-prone decision making that is used
              to explain a number of discrepancies between observed human behavior and the
              predictions of standard economic analysis.  This approach is used to evaluate
              alternative types of auctions and other mechanisms for coordinating the
              activities of buyers and sellers. Other applications include charitable
              contributions to public causes, strategic bargaining, and intra-industry
              competition.  In each case, data from laboratory experiments with human
              subjects are used to refine our approach.
