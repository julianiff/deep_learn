Abstract    :
              The United States admitted over 18 million legal immigrants since 1965, and
              additional three million immigrants are believed to reside in the country
              illegally.  These immigrants changed the skill composition of the work force,
              may be responsible for some of the recent changes in the wage structure
              observed in the 1980s, have had a profound impact on the demographic and
              socioeconomic characteristics of major cities, have set the stage for ethnic
              skill differentials that will persist well into the next century, and are sure
              to alter the economic opportunities available to American workers for many
              decades to come.   This project consists of a comprehensive research agenda
              designed to increase our understanding of the role that immigration and
              ethnicity play in the U.S. economy.  The theme that runs through the research
              projects is that immigration has both short and long-run effects, and that
              these effects are better understood if the analysis is based on a solid
              theoretical foundation. The empirical analysis will use the Public Use Samples
              of the U.S. Census from 1960 through 1990, the National Longitudinal Surveys of
              Youth, and the High School and Beyond survey.  The-main questions addressed by
              the research  project are:  1. What factors determine which ethnic groups are
              most likely to live in segregated neighborhoods--as well as which persons in
              those ethnic groups are likely to live in those neighborhoods? What are the
              implications of ethnic residential segregation for economic performance?  2.
              What is the impact of immigration on native earnings and  employment
              opportunities?  3. To what extent does the internal migration of native workers
              attenuate the regional wage differentials created by immigration? Are native
              workers sufficiently mobile so that that immigration has little effect on wage
              differentials across local labor markets?  4. What factors determine the
              socioeconomic experiences of immigrant children in the United States? Do
              observed characteristics explain a sizable part of the differences in academic
              achievement and work experience between native and immigrant children, as well
              as among the various immigrant groups? What are the long-run implications of
              these differences?
