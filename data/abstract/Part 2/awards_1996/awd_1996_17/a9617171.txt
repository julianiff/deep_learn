Abstract    :
                   This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry
              program supports the research of Professor John F. Hartwig at   Yale
              University.  This work seeks to uncover unusual reactions and   fundamental
              principles in the chemistry of metal-boryl and borane   complexes by evaluating
              the chemistry of complexes with Lewis-acidic   ligands.  It endeavors to
              functionalize hydrocarbons with metal boryl   complexes and to synthesize
              metallocene borane complexes related to   catalytic hydroboration processes. 
              These topics are to serve as case   studies in how the electrophilicity of
              boryl ligands and borane   substrates leads to new chemistry that has not been
              observed with more   conventional organometallic systems.  Boryl intermediates
              that interact   with hydrocarbons will be investigated and substituent effects
              on   selectivity will be measured in order to address how the electrophoricity 
               of covalent ligands affects reactivity.          Both fundamental and
              practical aspects of the early metal-borane and   boryl species will be
              studied.  The properties that stabilize or enhance   the reactivity of these
              complexes will be studied with regard to their   effects in catalytic
              hydroboration. The chiral selectivity of   titanocene-catalyzed hydroboration
              and the selectivity of single addition   to dienes will be studied.
