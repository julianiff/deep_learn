Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial
              support for two years for an OC-3 connection to the Very High Performance
              Backbone Network Service (vBNS).  The connection is through the MREN
              (Metropolitan Research and Education Network) ), an OC-12 ATM ring connecting
              several research institutions in the Chicago area to each other and to the
              vBNS.  Applications include projects on compilers, VLSI CAD, distributive
              higher performance computing, optimization techniques, and x-ray research. 
              Collaborating institutions include San Diego Supercomputing Center, Argonne
              National Laboratory, Cornell Theory Center, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center,
              and the National Center for Supercomputer Applications.
