Abstract    :
              9717116  Coley  Monodominant forests are unusual communities in the lowland
              tropics, but their origin and maintenance is not well understood. This study
              tests a number of mechanisms that may allow Gilbertiodendron dewevrei to form
              monodominant forests in eastern Zaire. The first hypothesis is that
              ectomycorrhizae (fungal-plant root symbioses) are important to the origin and
              maintenance of these extensive, monodominant forests. Secondly, to test the
              hypothesis that Gilbertiodendron competitively excludes other species by
              creating an inhospitable environment. This study will determine if mixed-forest
              species are unable to establish in the Gilbertiodendron forest because they do
              not encounter their appropriate, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.
              Furthermore, a number of other mechanisms will be tested (e.g. deep leaf
              litter, shade and low nutrient availability) by which Gilbertiodendron could
              exclude mixed-forest species from the monodominant forest. This study will
              conclusively test a number of mechanisms for monodominance and provide
              preliminary tests of other potential mechanisms. This study is important
              because an understanding of monodominant forests is essential to our
              understanding of the processes controlling lowland tropical tree diversity.
              Finally, it appears likely that no single character will explain monodominance.
              The proposed multifaceted analysis should provide the first empirically
              supported framework for understanding the origin and maintenance of tropical
              monodominant forests.
