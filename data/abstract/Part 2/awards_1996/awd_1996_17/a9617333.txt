              Instrumentation: Protyping Equipment for Application Specific Architectures   
              This research instrumentation grant enables two distinct research projects:   -
              Integrated 622Mhz Synthesizer for Telecommunications   - Methodology
              Extensions: Low Noise Integrated Circuit Design for Telecommunication Systems  
               The equipment in this proposal is requested to support research into a design
              methodology for a class of low noise integrated oscillators.  Stable, low noise
              oscillators are required as time and frequency references in applications such
              as wireless telecommunications, high speed microprocessors, disk drive read
              channels, and oversampled data conversion.  The key insight of the oscillator
              design methodology is the linkage of system-level performance to fundamental
              limits imposed by circuit-level considerations such thermal noise.  The
              methodology is being extended in the areas of higher speed (operating
              frequencies to 2.5GHz), lower power consumption, and more fabrication
              technologies (CMOS and BiCMOS).  Testing of the design methodology is carried
              out through design, fabrication, and test of integrated circuits that implement
              a system-level function.  The requested test equipment, which enables precise
              system- and circuit-level measurement in both the time and frequency domains,
              is essential to verify the theoretical predictions of the methodology.    The
              requested equipment is also part of an ongoing program to establish a design
              and test environment for education of undergraduate and graduate students in
              the complete mixed-signal integrated circuit design process.  The activities
              supported by this capability include interdisciplinary collaborative work and  
              involvement of undergraduate students in research.
