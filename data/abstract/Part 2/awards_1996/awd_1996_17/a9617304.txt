Abstract    :
              Clark    9617304    Two aspects of El Nino/ Southern Oscillation (ENSO), 
              dynamics will be studied using historical data and simple  dynamical models. 
              The first problem deals the ENSO  interaction between the western and central
              tropical Pacific  where evidence suggests that low-frequency sea surface 
              temperature in the western equatorial Pacific is associated  with evaporation
              by anomalous winds.  In addition, the  suppressed convection in the western
              equatorial Pacific  during a warm ENSO event results in winds being anomalously
               easterly there.  These Easterlies will generate an  equatorial upwelling
              Kelvin wave with a westward current  that, by zonal advection in the central
              equatorial Pacific  and upwelling in the eastern equatorial Pacific, can slow 
              and perhaps reverse the original warm event as a negative  feedback.  The
              influence of this negative feedback will be  tested with a coupled ocean
              atmosphere model.  The second  problem will look at the possibility that the
              decadal  variability observed in the tropical Pacific records is an  intrinsic
              part of the ENSO mechanism using simple and an  intermediate coupled models.
