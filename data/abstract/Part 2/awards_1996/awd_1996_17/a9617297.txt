Abstract    :
              9617297  Jahnke       Knowledge of the factors that control dissolution of 
              CaCO3 and hence, preservation, is critical to the  interpretation of the CaCO3 
              sedimentary record and to the  prediction of the linkages between sedimentary
              CaCO3 , ocean  chemistry and processes, and future climates.  Recent  results
              indicate that several aspects of CaCO3 dissolution,  especially dissolution
              driven by the metabolic production of  CO2 in sediment  pore waters, are poorly
              constrained.  This  has been demonstrated by: 1. regional variations in the 
              extent of  metabolic dissolution observed in in situ benthic  flux chamber
              incubations, 2. the lack of significant change  in the rate of dissolution
              calculated from in situ pore  water studies across the saturation horizon, and
              3. the  presence of aragonite in surface sediments that are overlain  by
              undersaturated bottom waters.       Two of the three regions, the Cape Verde
              Plateau,  Ontong Java Plateau and Cape Hatteras continental rise, that  have
              been studied previously will be revisited to further  constrain CaCO3
              dissolution mechanisms.  Specifically, fine-  scale pore water samples at in
              situ temperature and pressure  will be analyzed for Ca2+ and trace metals. 
              These results  will augment the data sets already obtained for these  regions
              previously.  In addition, in situ benthic flux  chamber incubations will be
              conducted to: 1. examine whether  chamber artifacts have influenced previous
              results, 2.  determine if fine-scale pore water Ca2+ gradients support  present
              dissolution models and agree with chamber  measurements, 3. examine whether
              other acid base reactions  are influencing predicted metabolic dissolution
              rates, 4.  assess variations in the mineralogy and reactivity of the  carbonate
              phases between the study sites, and 5. determine  whether exchange reactions at
              the carbonate mineral surface  can account for the variations in metabolic
              dissolution  observed.  ***
