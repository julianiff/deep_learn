Abstract    :
                The proposal is a request for support of a workshop "Paleoenvironments of
              Beringia".  The workshop will provide a forum for multidisciplinary discussion
              of the current state of knowledge of Beringian environments of the Quaternary. 
              The purposes of this workshop are to examine and synthesize diverse research
              fields concerning Beringia with the aim of preparing a new volume on Beringian
              paleoenvironments, and to establish an agenda for future Beringian research. 
              The workshop will include invited papers from key scientists from the US,
              Canada, and Russia, as well as submitted papers from other researchers and
              students.  The symposium will bring together a large number of scientists
              studying a problem that is very important to the future development of several
              ongoing research programs supported by NSF, including Paleoenvironments of
              Arctic Lakes and Estuaries and the Greenland Ice Shelf Project.
