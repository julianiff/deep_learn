              CTS - 9617405  Sohail Murad  University of Illinois Chicago      ABSTRACT      
              The project is an exploratory investigation of electro-osmosis in non-ionic and
              ionic solutions using computer simulation.  The primary objective of the
              research is to use molecular dynamics and Monte-Carlo simulations to study
              electro-osmosis at the molecular level.  Recently developed atomistic models
              will be employed in the simulation to describe a wide range of membrane pore
              size distribution.  The project may lead to an understanding of the factors
              that control electro-osmosis.  It will resolve the question of whether
              electro-osmosis occurs in non-ionic solutions.  The results will be relevant to
              improving the separation efficiency of membrane-based processes.
