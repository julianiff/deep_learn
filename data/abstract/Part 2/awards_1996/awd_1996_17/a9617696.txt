Abstract    :
              Two-third's of the Earth's crust is formed along mid-ocean  ridges, where
              tectonic plates spread apart and molten basalt  (magma) from the underlying
              mantle rises to fill the "gap"  and freezes.  By analogy with volcanic rift
              zones in Iceland  and Hawaii, most shallow magma transport along ridges 
              lacking a continuous magma chamber occurs in vertical cracks  (dikes), that are
              typically a few kilometers tall and a  meter or so wide, and that can propagate
              laterally for  several tens of kilometers.  Through a combination of  numerical
              models and laboratory experiments, we will study  the mechanical and thermal
              behavior of laterally-propagating  dikes along mid-ocean ridges.  We will focus
              on two aspects  that are not addressed by existing models of this process:  The
              role of the topographic slope in driving magma flow (the  magma essentially
              runs "downhill"), and the role of heat  flow in limiting the distance that
              dikes propagate.  The  goal is to determine the role of lateral dike
              propagation in  contributing to the structure and topography of crust  produced
              at slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges.
