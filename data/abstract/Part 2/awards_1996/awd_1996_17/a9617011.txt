Abstract    :
              Bothun, Gregory  AST 96-17011    Dr. Bothun will continue the discovery and
              detailed study  of low surface brightness members of the general galaxy 
              population in two ways.  The first is to continue  observations at radio and
              optical wavelengths to more fully  constrain the stellar populations, gas and
              dust content,  and metallicity of low surface brightness galaxies.  The  second
              is to study the populations of these galaxies from  new CCD surveys, especially
              the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,  and to better understand the result of any
              selection  effects.  This is a collaborative project with Dr.  Christopher
              Impey at the University of Arizona.
