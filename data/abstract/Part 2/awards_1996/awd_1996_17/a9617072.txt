Abstract    :
              9617072  Toole    The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will continue
              development   and testing of a moored profiling instrument. This device, shaped
                like and affectionately named the M&M, uses a traction drive to   propel
              itself up and down a mooring cable to full ocean depth.  Any   number of
              profiling instruments may be attached to the device that   is designed to
              accomplish up to 100 round trips between the   seafloor and the surface. This
              work will provide additional   deployment time in the ocean off Bermuda to
              document long-term   instrument and sensor behavior.  A series of three
              deployments   will be made there of four to eight months' duration over a  
              two-year period. Beyond acquiring technical and performance   experience with
              the Moored Profiler, the acquired data will   document the intensity of high
              frequency thermohaline   stratification variability offshore Bermuda.  These
              signals are   not resolved by conventional ship-based time-series station work 
               at this site.
