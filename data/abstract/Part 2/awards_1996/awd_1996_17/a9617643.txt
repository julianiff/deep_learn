Abstract    :
              9617643  Abstract  This project will evaluate the ecological consequences of
              climate change in moist and dry arctic tundra with field manipulations of
              winter precipitation and summer temperature.  Project scientists will
              investigate effects on species performance, community structure, and ecosystem
              C and N dynamics.  They will erect snow fences to increase snowpack and use
              small greenhouses to warm air and soil temperatures.  Growth  rings and annual
              stem increments of wood species and physiological plant performance will be
              compared with historical temperature and precipitation records.  Experimental
              findings will also be compared to natural vegetation patterns along snow
              gradients and areas where long-term anthropogenic increases in snow cover have
              occurred.  Simulation modeling will be used to extend their findings with a
              focus on net ecosystem carbon budgets.  The main effort will be to quantify and
              understand the magnitude and direction of the transient response of arctic
              tundra to a series of climate change scenarios.  The experimental
              infrastructure will permit more detailed investigations by other investigators
              in future years if the response is, as we anticipate, of sufficient magnitude
              to be of importance for evaluation effects of climate change to arctic
              ecosystems.  The project is a U. S. contribution Of the International Tundra
              Experiment (ITEX).
