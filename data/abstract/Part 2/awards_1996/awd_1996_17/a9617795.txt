              OCE-9617795                              ABSTRACT                               
                                             OCE-9617795      The Bermuda Atlantic
              Time-Series Study (BATS) was established  as  one  of two oceanic time-series
              observatories under the U.S.Joint  Global  Ocean Flux Study (the other being
              the Hawaii Ocean  Time-  Series) to determine and understand the processes
              controlling the  time-varying flux or carbon and associated biogenic  elements 
              in  the ocean.  With this award, the activities of BATS will continue  for 
              another three years.  As BATS investigators have done  since  the  mid-1980's,
              these efforts will include studies of  seasonal,  interannual,  and  decadal
              variations in ocean physics,  biology,  and  chemistry.   In  particular
              studies  will  focus  on  carbon  biogeochemistry  and  the sea-air flux of 
              carbon  dioxide.   The  overall  activity  will continue to be a mixture  of 
              time-series  measurements  of  critical parameters of oceanic  functioning  as 
              well as process studies.
