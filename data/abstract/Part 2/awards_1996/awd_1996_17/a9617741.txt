Abstract    :
                Moore  9617741  This research focuses on the factors that influence jurors'
              perception of child witnesses.  In particular, a child's age has been shown to
              influence jurors' judgments of the child's credibility.  Two pilot experiments
              are being conducted at this time.  The first is designed to explore the utility
              of using q-sort techniques for assessing adults' stereotypes of children of
              various ages.  In the second, adults will hear testimony of a child.  The age
              of the child will be manipulated.  The range of ages adults find believable
              will be evaluated.  The results of these pilot studies will inform the
              development of a complete proposal designed to advance scientific knowledge of
              stereotyping and of jurors' decision making.  %%%  This research focuses on the
