Abstract    :
              Abstract  Miller  9617181    The PI has proposed a study of time varying (TV) or
              flickering flames created by imposing a modulation on the fuel flow rate, which
              creates flames that pinch-off and then detach from the burner.  These flames
              are significantly different from non-perturbed steady flames and may offer an
              ideal environment to reproducibly study chemistry-turbulence interactions which
              are believed to control, ignition, extinction, and flame propagation in
              turbulent reacting flows.  The PI has proposed a proof-of principle
              experimental study in which rapid probe sampling of a TV methane/air diffusion
              flame using both tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) to measure
              CH4, CO2, CO and NO concentrations, and mass spectrometry to determine the
              concentrations of major flame species as well as concentrations of several
              products of incomplete combustion (small hydrocarbons).
