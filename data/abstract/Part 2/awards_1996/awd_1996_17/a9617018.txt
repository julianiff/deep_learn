Abstract    :
              This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              the City University of New York.  The student will investigate the rapid
              fertility decline which took place in Guadeloupe between 1960 and 1982, which
              appeared to signify that France had successfully stemmed population growth in
              this overseas department.  The demographic literature correlated low fertility
              with `modernization` and a `European` type of family, inferring that
              assimilated Guadeloupeans have moved away from displaying traits associated
              with a `Caribbean` family model.  However, between 1962 and 1982 a changing
              opportunity structure, particularly government sponsored labor migration, may
              have played a role.  The hypothesis to be tested posits that low fertility is
              not associated primarily with a `European` family model, but can be found among
              women who are situated in a variety of family forms.  The hypothesis will be
              tested using extensive life history and structured interview data from a sample
              of 40 Guadeloupean women from diverse socio-economic backgrounds.    This
              research is important because it will advance the theory of fertility declines
              in developing countries, by testing the effects of labor migration, and by
              fitting the general theory to this particular case.  In addition the project
              will advance our scientific capacity by training a graduate student in
              demographic anthropology, and will also advance our nation's expertise about
              this important region of the world.
