Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OCE-9617960    Denitrification rates in continental shelf sediments
              are globally significant in that they affect nutrient availability in surface
              waters of the ocean, modulate oceanic productivity and influence atmospheric
              carbon dioxide concentrations.  Classical approaches to determine these rates
              are limited, since nitrogen fluxes cannot be accurately estimated from wide
              areas of the coastal ocean where rates are moderate or low, and these regions
              may be more important globally than those areas already identified with high
              rates.    The objective of this proposal is to expand our ability to measure
              denitrification rates in areas of low or moderate nitrogen fluxes.  The
              approach to be employed by the principal investigator is to use a more precise
              mass spectrometric technique, where not only nitrogen, but nitrogen/argon
              ratios are measured in order to determine more accurately nitrogen fluxes in
              sediment cores collected from test sites in the Gulf of Maine region.  The
              principal investigator is a leading pioneer in studies of the global nitrogen
              cycle, and advances based upon this new method should expand significantly our
              ability to identify and quantify global sources and sinks of nitrogen in marine
              systems.    Christensen (OCE-9617960)
