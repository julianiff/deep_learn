Abstract    :
                This project connects Southeastern University to the Internet over a
              partial-T1 line.  Faculty and students at the school benefit from access to the
              resources of the Internet, including libraries and supercomputers.  In
              addition, they are able to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other
              institutions in pursuit of research and educational projects.  The award
              provides partial support of the project for one year.
