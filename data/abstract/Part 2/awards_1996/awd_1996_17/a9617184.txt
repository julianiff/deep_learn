Abstract    :
              Allison  9617184  This effort will place a centerpiece display in the Science
              and Technology wing of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of
              American History (NMAH).  It is in this section of the museum that the role of
              science-based technology in the history of the United States is displayed and
              explained.    A Cray 2 supercomputer and a very large screen display of
              scientific visualizations will be used as a "draw" for this area.  This would
              he a lead-in to the ongoing exhibit entitled "Information Age:  People,
              Information, and Technology".    Much of the visually displayed material will
              be drawn from the scientific results generated at the NSF supercomputer
              Centers.  With the expansion of the Centers Program to include all the expected
              that the efforts in science and engineering results from an even wider array of
              sources will be able to supply many topically up to date displays for the
              foreseeable future.
