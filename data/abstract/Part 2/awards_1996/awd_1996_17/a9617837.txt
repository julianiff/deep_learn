Abstract    :
              9617837  Kabanov  The objective of this international collaboration is to 
              investigate: (1) complexes formed by ionogenic block  copolymers and oppositely
              charged synthetic polyions; and  (2) complexes formed by ionogenic block
              copolymers and  surfactants of opposite charge.  These complexes represent  new
              classes of materials which combine the properties of  cooperative
              polyelectrolyte or polymer-colloidal complexes  (sensitivity to ionic strength
              and pH, ability to  participate in cooperative polyion exchange and
              substitution  reactions) with the ability of amphiphilic block copolymers  to
              form micelles and mesophases.  %%%  It is expected that these materials could
              find applications  in various fields including drug delivery and release, 
              membrane technologies, biocompatible materials, and  biocatalysis.  ***
