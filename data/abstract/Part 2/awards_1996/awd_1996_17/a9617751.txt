Abstract    :
                9617751  Bangs         This is a survey of the Barbados Ridge accretionaly
              wedge  designed to image the back of the wedge with seismic reflection 
              profiling and to obtain a detailed velocity model of the back of  the wedge and
              backstop with wide-angle reflection/refraction data  recorded on OBS
              instruments.  the goal is to define the geometry  and structure of the
              backstop, the subducting ocean crust, and the  back of the accretionary wedge
              to address mass balance, the  seismogenic zone, and other tectonic questions.
