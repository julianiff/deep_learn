Abstract    :
              9617878  Hodell    This grant provides $156,271 as partial support of the costs
              of  acquiring a new continuous flow, stable isotope ratio mass  spectrometer
              (CF-SIRMS) with an automated carbonate sample  preparation and introduction
              device ("Kiel device").  The new  SIRMS will complement an existing but dated
              VG Prism II mass  spectrometer (circa 1985) and will benefit a large group of 
              faculty at Florida who utilize stable isotopes in their research  and have
              specific needs for large sample throughput for studies  in paleooceanography,
              paleolimnology and paleoclimatology that  require large numbers of analyses on
              small samples (down to 10  micrograms) from marine and lacustrine sediment
              cores including,  oxygen isotopic analyses of carbonate microfossils, corals
              and  gastropods as indicators of paleo water temperatures, stable  isotope
              stratigraphic analysis of ODP cores and assessment of the  viability of the
              oxygen isotopic records contained in biogenic  silica (diatoms and
              radiolarians) as an alternate and  complimentary climate proxy to stable
              isotopic analysis of  carbonate microfossils.  Additionally, continuous flow
              SIRMS will  allow measurement of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur isotopes on a 
              single gas sample enhancing studies utilizing, stable isotopic  analyses of
              marine invertebrate and vertebrate skeletal material  as proxies of
              paleoecology, analysis of C/N, del 13-C and del 15-  N of organics in
              lacustrine sediments as indicators of  paleoproductivity and nutrient cycling,
              studies of paleodiet  based on stable isotopic analyses of bone collagen and
              studies of  early diagenesis and trophic dynamics utilizing stable isotopes  as
              tracers of the fate of organic matter.  ***
