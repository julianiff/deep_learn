Abstract    :
                  This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial
              support for an DS3 ATM connection to the Very  High Performance Backbone
              Network Service (vBNS).  The connection is to be upgraded to an OC-3c circuit
              during the second year.    Applications include:  - Superkamiokande detector
              analysis of atmospheric and solar neutrino interactions information  - Rapid
              earthquake Alerts and Information Distribution and Real-time seismic waveform
              data exchange between networks  - IRIS Data Management Center data distribution
               - Optical Astronomy from a Remote Facility  Collaborating with:    Institution
              of Cosmic Ray Research, University of Tokyo    University of California at
