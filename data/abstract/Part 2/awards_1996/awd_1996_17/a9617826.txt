Abstract    :
              Impey, Christopher  AST 96-17826    Dr. Impey will continue the discovery and
              detailed study of  low surface brightness members of the general galaxy 
              population in two ways.  The first is to continue  observations at radio and
              optical wavelengths to more fully  constrain the stellar populations, gas and
              dust content,  and metallicity of low surface brightness galaxies.  The  second
              is to study the populations of these galaxies from  new CCD surveys, especially
              the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,  and to better understand the result of any
              selection  effects.  This is a collaborative project with Dr. Gregory  Bothun
              at the University of Oregon Eugene.
