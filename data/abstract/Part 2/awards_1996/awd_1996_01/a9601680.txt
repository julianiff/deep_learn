Abstract    :
              CTS - 9601680  Raul F. Lobo  U of Delaware      ABSTRACT      Investigators
              interested in a broad range of advanced materials research including
              microporous inorganic catalysts and adsorbents, complex transition metal
              oxides, superconductors, semiconductor synthesis and characterization,
              photovoltaic cells and structural organomettallic chemistry, will use the new
              X-ray diffraction system extensively in their research.  The instruments will
              be used primarily for the investigation of powders and thin films.  The
              diffractometer brings together expertise from a variety of disciplines and will
              encourage and facilitate collaboration between different research groups.  This
              new instrument solves a serious research infrastructure and educational
              limitation at the University of Delaware.    ***
