Abstract    :
                   The retina is the sheet of tissue in the back of the eye that contains the
              photoreceptor cells and complex network of nerve cells for the first stages of
              visual processing.  This conference is devoted specifically to how the retina
              handles information, and includes topics in systems level, cellular, and
              molecular biology.  Results are compared between vertebrate and invertebrate
              eyes, between biological and artificial/machine vision, regulation of neural
              transmission in different parts of the retina, and adaptations to different
              environments such as polarized light for underwater vision in fish.  Discussion
              of new findings in these fundamental areas emphasize presentations by young
              investigators.      Because studies of the anatomy, biochemistry and physiology
              of the retina have provided numerous models for the way in which nerve cells in
              the brain handle information flow, this conference is likely to have an impact
              beyond visual neuroscience alone.  It also will be an important forum for young
              investigators to exchange ideas with seasoned investigators about topics of
              very high current interest.
