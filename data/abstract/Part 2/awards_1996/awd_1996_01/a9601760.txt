Abstract    :
                        This is the second wave of a panel study of Russian army officers and
              their wives, about half of whom are leaving the service as a result of
              downsizing.  Russian military downsizing is occurring under conditions of
              substantial economic privation and social change.  This is a quasi-experimental
              study of changes in the life course of officers who will be discharged and
              their wives, compared to officers remaining in service and their wives. 
              Fieldwork for Wave 1 surveys  was carried out between October, 1995, and
              January, 1996, or 3-6 months prior to discharges.  A total of 1,804 officers
              and 1,616 spouses were surveyed through an interview that measured many
              dimensions of their career, attitudes and beliefs concerning employment, plus
              the material and social-psychological situations of their families.  This study
              will administer a follow-up survey in early 1997, approximately 15-18 months
              after the Wave 1 survey, thus greatly enriching the data set.  By early 1997,
              some officers will be unemployed, some will be re-employed, and others who
              remain in the military will be witnessing the plight of their former fellow
              officers.  The respondent sample is anticipated to include 1,530 officers and
              1,374 spouses.            This historically important downsizing will
              facilitate testing hypotheses from the life course perspective, the stress
              literature, and identity theories.  The overall model includes (1) tracing
              effects of job loss on officers' career paths, family life (e.g., marital
              satisfaction and wife's employment), and psychological well-being; (2)
              exploring potential mediators  (processes by which job disruption has effects)
              and moderators (specifying the scope of effects); (3) assessing effects of
              downsizing on "organizational survivors" (officers who are not discharged); and
              (4) examining effects on the family, especially wives.   This research builds
              on American studies of the social psychological effects of job loss, thus
              contributing to the fundamental literature on stress and the w ays that human
              beings cope with it, with insights gained under conditions of greater tension
              than usually has been examined in previous work.  The project has implications
              for foreign policy, because is vital to understand Russian military downsizing
              and the struggle of this vast nation to become a modern, democratic state.  The
              success or failure of these transformations will determine the quality of the
              world environment and the course of global change.
