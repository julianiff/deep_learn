Abstract    :
                Physical anthropologists study the growth and development of our primate
              relatives because they  offer insights into the evolution of our species. 
              There have been many studies which investigate  postnatal craniofacial growth
              of the pigtailed macaque.  However, there is a paucity of data that  describes
              the growth and development of the fetal craniofacial complex in this species. 
              The purpose of this research is to construct a three dimensional model of the
              fetal craniofacial  complex in the pigtailed macaque and describe its growth in
              three dimensions.  Landmark data  will be collected from three dimensional
              reconstructed computed tomographic images.  Finite  Element Scaling Analysis
              will be used to generate a three dimensional model and to describe the 
              patterns of size and shape changes in the craniofacial complex through time.   
              This research will provide the first three dimensional model of the fetal
              craniofacial complex in  this species.  Furthermore, it will provide baseline
              data for the discussion of evolutionary size and  shape transformations during
              the fetal period throughout primates.  Finally, a non-destructive  method of
              data acquisition (3D-CT reconstructions) is introduced that can be used to
              study rare  museum specimens.
