Abstract    :
              ***  9601638  Tate  This grant will provide partial funding for the equipment 
              for an undergraduate atomic, molecular, and optical physics  research and
              teaching laboratory at Colby College.  This  laboratory will provide students
              with experience in high  resolution spectroscopy, both conventional and laser. 
              The  laboratory will be used both for instruction in various  courses and in
              senior level independent research.  In  addition, it will enhance the research
              of faculty members.  ***
