Abstract    :
              Brinton  9601248      One of the hallmark characteristics of the cerebral cortex
              is its  integrative capacity.  Information derived from the external 
              environment, from systems that control bodily function and from  internal
              conscious and unconscious events all converge onto the  cerebral cortex for
              processing and storage.  A critical, as yet,  unanswered question concerns the
              mechanism(s) by which integration  of information occurs in the cerebral
              cortex.  To address this  question, Dr. Brinton is investigating the role of
              the vasopressin  receptor in this context.  Vasopressin is a small protein
              molecule  which enhances long-term memory, a function associated with the 
              cerebral cortex.  The experiments focus on the cellular,  biochemical and
              genomic events triggered by activation of cortical  vasopressin receptors
              essential for the integration of information.   These investigations provide a
              greater understanding of the basic  mechanisms for the brain to process
              information, and gives us a  greater understanding of how learning and memory
              are generated.
