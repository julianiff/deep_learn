Abstract    :
              9601850  Karl       The PI requests funding to establish a shared-use, deep- 
              ocean instrumented mooring facility to support both general  and specialized
              time-series observations that are critical  for a complete understanding of
              less frequent, episodic  events.  Current projects which justify this purchase
              are  the Hawaiian Ocean Time-series (HOT) measurements which  include
              components in both JGOFS and WOCE.  Proposed  instrumentation for the mooring
              include an IMET meteorology  package, an ADCP, an acoustic release to recover
              the  mooring, a remote water sampler, a bio-optical package, and  seacats to
              measure temperature and conductivity.  The SOEST  Deep-Ocean Instrumented
              Mooring Facility will initially be  established and managed as a standard NSF
              research project;  i.e., distributed responsibility among the four listed co- 
              PIs.  Ultimately this facility will be supported by project-  specific State
              and Federal research grants.  UH's costshare  of $209, 450 represents 53% of
              this project's cost.  ***
