Abstract    :
                    9601619  Es-Said  This Academic Research Infrastructure Award (ARI)
              provides  partial funding for an x-ray diffraction system that will be used  to
              conduct research on controlling the mechanical anisotropy of  sheet metal.  In
              particular the effect of varying the amounts of  cold rolling on the
              crystallographic texture in aluminum lithium  alloys and rhenium metal will be
              investigated.  These materials  are used in the aerospace and electronics
              industries.   Undergraduate students will be part of the research effort which 
              is also correlated with efforts at several specific companies.  ***
