Abstract    :
              9601198  Eickbush   Transposable elements, abundant components of eukaryotic
              genomes, have probably played a significant role in determining the size and
              structure of these genomes. R1 and R2 are retrotransposable elements found
              inserted in the 28S ribosomal RNA genes in all insect lineage's and in all
              classes of Arthropods. R1 and R2 elements from modern and ancient insect
              orders, as well as from each class of Arthropod will be isolated and sequenced
              in the region of the open reading frame. That information will be used to
              construct a phylogenetic tree with the goal of determining if the elements have
              been present since the origin of arthropods. The origin and stability of highly
              divergent families of R1 and/or R2 within the genus Drosophila will be studied.
              The questions of whether each family can independently regulate its own level
              of insertion and of horizontal transfer will be addressed. The population
              dynamics of these elements in species where they are maintained at high and low
              average levels will be investigated. These studies will be complemented by
              computer simulations to determine whether simple models of recombination and
              retrotransposition can explain the observed distributions.  %%%  Mobile
              elements or their remnants represent as much as 30% of the genomes of most
              eukaryotes. It is probable that these elements have had a significant impact on
              size and structure of eukaryotic chromosomes and it is remarkable that many
              basic questions concerning their evolution, regulation and costs or benefits to
              their hosts remain unanswered. This study will add to the little we know of the
              genetic impact of transposable elements in host genomes.  ***
