Abstract    :
              9601975  Ludwig    This grant, made through the Academic Research 
              Infrastructure (ARI) Program, provides $200,000 as  partial support of the
              costs of acquiring a state-  of-the-art, high abundance sensitivity, thermal 
              ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) with multiple  collectors, to be used for
              Uranium series and U-Th-  Pb geochronology.  Specific projects will include 
              the dating of siliceous microfossils, pedogenic  silica and carbonate,
              speleothems, corals and  materials from archaeological sites such as tooth 
              enamel using U-series methods for samples in the  20-500 Ka age range and U/Pb
              techniques for dating  of pre-Mesozoic igneous accessory phases.  These  data
              should provide new age controls on the late  Pleistocene marine stratigraphic
              record, the  timing of pedogenesis and thus climate history of  opal-bearing
              soils, high-resolution records of  paleoclimate recorded in spleothem calcites
              and  records of paleosea level based on accurate  geochronologies determined
              from U-series dating of  near-surface dwelling corals such as Acropora 
              palmata.  The new TIMS will also serve to  calibrate Stanford-USGS SHRIMP ion
              microprobe  analyses of individual zircons and will provide  independent checks
              of 40Ar/39Ar dates of volcanic  zircons and sanidines obtained using the
              existing  noble gas mass spectrometer at the BGC.  Funding  of this TIMS will
              also shared with NSF's  Archaeometry Program (SBR-9601068).  ***
