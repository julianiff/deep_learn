Abstract    :
              9601885  Sleight    An X-ray diffraction system for materials research will be 
              acquired by Oregon State University. The system will support  studies of
              thin-film superconductors, transparent conductors,  electroluminescent devices,
              magnetic semiconductors and  dielectrics; thermal expansion of materials and
              other dynamic  studies; nonlinear optical crystals; and nanocomposites. The 
              proposed instrument will expand current capabilities for  structural
              characterization of materials by including components  for analyzing thin films
              and collecting data quickly, both at low  and high temperatures.  %%%  The
              added measurement capabilities will provide a means for  establishing an
              understanding of the basic relationships among  structure, properties, and
              processing conditions for a given  material. These relationships will then be
              used as a basis for  creating new or improved materials. The proposed
              activities will  be performed in a collaborative  interdisciplinary mode, 
              enhancing both the prospects for solving difficult problems and  the research
              training of students.  ***
