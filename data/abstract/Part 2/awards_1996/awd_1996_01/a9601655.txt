              Academic Research Infrastructure: Instrumentation Acquisition for
              Improvisational Animation Research and Training    This Academic Research
              Infrastructure award supported by the facility include:    1. Communication
              (simulated conferences, shared virtual worlds).    2. Education (computer
              guides and instructors, large-scale simulations), and    3. Entertainment
              (synthetic performance, role playing games).    This research seeks to bring
              human participation more fully into a virtual environment.
