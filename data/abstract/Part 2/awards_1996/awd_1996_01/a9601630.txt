Abstract    :
                Funding  is  requested  to  purchase a gas  chromatograph-isotope  ratio  mass
              spectrometer (GC-CIRMS). This instrument permits  the  measurement  of carbon
              and nitrogen stable isotope  ratios  of  a  wide variety of organic molecules,
              essentially all of those which  can  be  resolved by gas chromatography or
              which can be converted  to  a suitable volatile derivative. Also, funds are
              requested for  an  off-line,  automated high-performance  liquid 
              chromatography  (HPLC) system for isolation of specific compounds for
              subsequent,  off-line,  IRMS.  This approach is needed for  certain  compounds 
              which  are  too involatile or lack sufficient heat stability  for  GC;  it also
              can be more convenient for compounds, such as  amino  acids,  which require
              extensive derivatization for GC.  Together,  these  instruments would
              constitute a facility that could measure  the  C  and  N  isotopic  composition
              of  virtually  any  organic  substance.  Specifically, the HPLC and GC-IRMS
              would be  used  to  measure  the stable isotope composition of amino acids and 
              fatty  acids  in  the course of studies of the growth rate  and  trophic 
              dynamics  of  marine mammals. The stable isotope  composition  of  specific 
              organic compounds, such as amino acids,  carbohydrates,  hydrocarbons, and
              lipids, from marine and lake sediments would be  used  in  investigations of
              the sources and diagenetic alteration  of these substances, assisting studies
              of environmental change at  high  northern latitudes. Also, the instruments
              would be used  in  tracer  investigations  of the metabolism  of  large 
              mammals  by  measuring  changes  over  time  in the  isotopic  composition  of 
              metabolites such as volatile fatty acids. Finally, the  GC-C-IRMS  would  be 
              used  to distinguish naturally-occurring  hydrocarbons  from petroleum-derived
              contaminants.
