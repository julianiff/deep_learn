Abstract    :
              9601996  This award provides support for the Mid-America Drosophila  Stock
              Center at Bowling Green University.  The center  maintains a large collection
              of mutant strains of  the fruit  fly Drosophila melanogaster, an organism
              widely used in  basic investigations of genetics and developmental biology.  On
              request, samples of  mutant strains are provided  for use  in research and
              education.  The collection was originally  established in 1960 at the Institute
              for Cancer Research in  Philadelphia using strains from the personal
              collections of  H.J. Mueller and J. Shultz.  The collection moved to Bowling 
              Green University in 1996 and, since then, has grown to  include over 4,000
              strains isolated by a number different  investigators.  During the period of
              this award, it is  expected that the most useful strains will be shifted to a 
              similar, but larger,  NSF-supported collection at the  Indiana University.  
              This merging of the two collections is  expected to increase the effectiveness
              with which collection  holdings are made available to the research community in
              the  future.
