Abstract    :
              Project Summary    Instrumentation is requested to support the interactive
              research  efforts of the four laboratories comprising the Yale Cell  Motility
              and Cytoskeletal Group. This proposal is aimed at  complementing ongoing
              collaborative research efforts and  extending our technical capabilities in the
              area of molecular  dynamics and confocal laser scanning microscopy.
              Specifically, we  have requested funding for acquisition of a state-of-the-art 
              confocal laser scanning microscope and requisite components for  design and
              construction of a high resolution digital imaging  system for studying
              molecular dynamics. This system will  implement: fluorescence photobleaching
              and photoactivation  analyses, single beam gradient laser trapping, cell
              ablation and  quantitative low light level imaging of fluorescent probes in 
              real time.    Research activities facilitated by this award will include 
              investigation of the molecular dynamics of neuronal growth and  target
              recognition (Forscher); molecular and functional analyses  of actin and
              microtubule-based molecular motors (Mooseker,  Wolenski and Rosenbaum). The
              requested instrumentation will also  significantly augment the research and
              training mission of the  Department of Biology's Training and Research Facility
              for  Imaging. This includes advanced courses in optical methods and  their use
              in molecular cell biology at both undergraduate and  graduate levels.
