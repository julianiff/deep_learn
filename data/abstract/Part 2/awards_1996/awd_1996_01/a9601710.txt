Abstract    :
              This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will   assist
              the Department of Chemistry at Rutgers University acquire a   fourier transform
              infrared spectrometer (FT-IR).  This equipment will   enhance research in a
              number of areas including the following: (1)   chemical and electrochemical
              synthesis of polymers and the   characterization of their electrical and
              optical properties  (2)    biomaterials including protein structure-function
              relationships, and (3)    solid-state materials including the synthesis and
              characterization of new   ternary and quaternary metal chalcogenids,
              particularly tellurides.   A fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR)
              can provide important   information about chemical structure reactivity.  Its
              use may enable   breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties of
              reactivity and   nonreactivity of molecules.
