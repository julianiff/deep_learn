Abstract    :
              ***  9601613  Burchat  This grant provides partial support for the purchase of 
              computer and electronics instrumentation for the recently  expanded
              experimental particle physics effort in the Physics  Department at Stanford
              University.  This instrumentation  will be used by faculty, research
              associates, graduate  students and undergraduates working on the design of 
              detectors and electronic readout systems, as well as the  analysis of data, for
              experiments that explore the  fundamental constituents of matter.  The
              instrumentation  requested in this proposal will provide the core around  which
              a strong research effort in detector development and  data analysis can be
              built.  The instrumentation has two related components: state-of-the-  art
              instrumentation for the development of high-speed  electronics for detector
              readout and a computer system  comprised of a powerful central server and a
              cluster of  advanced workstations, sufficient to meet both the  simulation and
              analysis needs of the  particle physics group  at Stanford.  The
              instrumentation for detector development  consists of high-speed digital and
              analog oscilloscopes and  a high-speed pulse generator for simulating detector
              pulses  and for synchronization in applications with critical timing 
              requirements.  ***
