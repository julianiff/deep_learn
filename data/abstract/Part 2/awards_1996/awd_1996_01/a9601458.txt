Abstract    :
                               In recent years, complex biological problems are       
              increasingly analyzed using computer simulation models.        Unfortunately,
              the development and application of these        simulations are too often
              beyond the reach of experimental        biologists, most of whom have neither
              the background nor        the time to devote to mastering conventional
              simulation        tools. This proposal addresses the problem of making       
              simulation accessible to biological scientists. Software        development is
              proposed that is intuitive, easily        accessible to the novice within a few
              hours, and        sufficiently powerful to develop innovative, state of the    
                 art simulations. The objective is to provide the tools for        both
              researchers and students of biology that will be:                     1.
              Designed specifically to handle biological             problems.               
                        2. Intuitive and easy to learn and use by scientists                 
                        with limited                 mathematical or computer experience.    
                                   3. Sufficiently flexible to handle a wide variety of      
                                   problems.                           4. Sufficiently
              powerful to tackle current problems  in the research                  
              literature.                5. Sufficiently flexible to allow teachers to design
               their own simulation                       exercises and interfaces according
              to their  own experience and tastes.          These objectives will be
              accomplished with software that        contains an intuitive graphical
              interface designed        specifically for constructing biological models and
              solving        them very quickly. It will also contain a convenient output     
                display that is conducive to exploring model parameters,        curve fitting
              model results to empirical data, and plotting        results in different modes
              (e.g. run time, batch, overlay,        strip chart, triggered oscilloscope, 2
              or 3 dimensions,        phase p lane, iso- and nullclines). The software will  
                   contain modern algorithms for solving stiff systems of        ordinary
              differential and difference equations, initial and        boundary value
              problems, partial differential equations,        root finders, location of
              bifurcations, optimization, and        stochastic problems. In many cases these
              mathematical        techniques will be invisible to the inexperienced user, but
                     will be available to the more advanced worker.
