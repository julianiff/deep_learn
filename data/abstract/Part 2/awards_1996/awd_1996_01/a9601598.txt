Abstract    :
              9601598  Pelz    An ultrahigh-vacuum, variable-temperature scanning tunneling 
              microscope and an x-ray spectroscopy facility will be established  at Ohio
              State University. The facility will be attached to a  modular molecular beam
              epitaxy system and will thus allow for in  situ characterization of the
              chemistry and electronic structure  of heterostructure interfaces. Research
              activities supported by  the facility include studies of the interface
              chemistry and  atomic structure of GaAs grown on lattice-matched Ge/GeSi/Si 
              substrates,  charge trapping in metal/semiconductor structures,  the growth of
              epitaxial metal/semiconductor structures with III-V  materials, and metal
              contact formation on polymer films. The  scanning tunneling microscope will be
              configured so that it can  perform variable-temperature ballistic electron
              emission  microscopy of buried interfaces, in addition to conventional 
              structural studies of surfaces. This will permit detailed studies  of
              metal/semiconductor interface formation over a wide range of  metal coverage. 
              %%%  The incorporation of the requested instrumentation to the film  growth
              facility results in a powerful tool for the  characterization of interfaces
              between dissimilar materials. In  addition to the direct research benefits,
              acquisition of the  instrumentation will enhance the training of graduate
              students  from several departments through interdisciplinary research using 
              state-of-the-art facilities.  ***
