Abstract    :
                   A major goal of this project is the study of how deaf  children who use
              American Sign Language (ASL) acquire competence  in English, a language that
              differs from their first in modality.  Toward this goal, the project seeks to
              explore whether and how  putatively English forms in everyday use of ASL might
              be a source  of reading development. These forms include fingerspelling, a 
              system of manually representing print words in English, as well  as other
              signed forms related to fingerspelling such as  initialized signs, loan signs
              and hybrid sign-fingerspelled  compounds. The latter forms are categorized
              Foreign vocabulary,  to distinguish them from the larger Native vocabulary of
              ASL  which derives from gestural sources. The project will undertake a 
              linguistic description of a variety of Foreign forms through  studies with
              native adult signers. In addition, the project will  study use of these forms
              by young native and nonnative signers  whose competence in English is emerging.
              This two-pronged  approach will accomplish both a broader description of the
              ASL  lexicon and a broader description of language competence in  signing deaf
              children.       There are at least three important outcomes to this project:  (
              1 ) an expansion of our understanding of sign languages to  include vocabulary
              deriving from representational systems such as  fingerspelling which exist not
              only in ASL but in a great many  other sign languages; (2) understanding the
              role of  representational systems in signing deaf children's acquisition  of a
              language; that does not share the modality of their first  language and (3) a
              broader account of reading ability in deaf  children.
