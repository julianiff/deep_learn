Abstract    :
              9601839  Almasan    A superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) 
              magnetometer for materials research will be acquired by Kent  State University.
              The instrument will support research on the  magnetic properties of high
              transition temperature  superconductors and of liquid crystals. Major research
              projects  that will use the instrument include studies of Josephson  coupling
              of copper oxide bilayers and of the vortex phases in  high-temperature
              superconductors, and of phase transitions and  critical points in lyotropic and
              polymeric liquid crystals.  %%%  The instrument will benefit a group of young
              faculty working in  one area which routinely involves sensitive magnetometry 
              (superconductivity) and in another area where the application of  such
              technique is just emerging (liquid crystals). Both the  principal investigator
              and main co-investigator in the project  are female faculty in physics, a
              discipline where women are  severely underrepresented. The instrument facility
              will enhance  their role model and will help to attract female students to the 
              sciences.  ***
