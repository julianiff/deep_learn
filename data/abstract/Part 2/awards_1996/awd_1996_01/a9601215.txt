Abstract    :
                   A major issue in sensory systems processing is how a relevant signal is
              extracted from distracting background noise in the environment.  Hearing is
              excellent for detecting certain highly relevant signals, such as communication
              signals, and we know little about the neural mechanisms involved.  This project
              uses a combination of neurophysiological recording with computational modeling
              to determine how single cells can detect features of an auditory signal.  
              Computational techniques are used to change particular features of the sounds
              presented to the ear, and to analyze the responses of the cells.  Spatial and
              temporal patterns of activity from single cells are compared to the patterns of
              activity coming into those cells from auditory nerve fibers, in a part of the
              brainstem called the anteroventral cochlear nucleus.  These experiments test
              hypotheses about how much "feature detection" can be done at this level of the
              auditory system, and how much of this depends on analysis of the "spectral
              shape" of combined frequencies in a complex signal.     Results from this study
              will be important beyond auditory perception to studies of sensory processing
              in general, to understanding how the brain integrates a wide range of
              simultaneous activity, and to better design of electronic devices for
              artificial listening and auditory aids.
