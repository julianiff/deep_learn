              Academic Research Infrastructure: Laboratory for Advanced Communications
              Systems    This Academic Research Infrastructure award supports the acquisition
              of high speed networking equipment including wireless and wired networking
              infrastructure and switches.    The research projects supported by this
              instrumentation include research on local electromagnetic field
              characterization, testing tools for wireless local area data communications
              standards, model-based network diagnosis, implementation and evaluation of
              algorithms for ATM Quality of Service policies, and the design, implementation
              and evaluation of data parallel I/O using high speed networks and heterogeneous
              workstations.
