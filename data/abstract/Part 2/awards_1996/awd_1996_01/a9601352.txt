Abstract    :
              This grant will be used in developing software for The LINGUIST  Network, an
              electronic discussion forum for academic linguists  produced at Eastern
              Michigan University and Texas A&M University.  In its 5 years of operation,
              LINGUIST has become the central  international clearinghouse for information
              relevant to  linguistics. Its current issues and 10,000 back issues represent 
              a rich source of data about languages, linguistic methodology,  and the
              sociology of the discipline. However, LINGUIST has come  to need additional
              software to support its expanding list of  services and to accommodate the
              dramatic changes in Internet  technologies that have occurred during the last 5
              years. Such  software will enable LINGUIST to develop its new World Wide Web 
              site in such a way as to provide functionalities not commonly  available and to
              accomplish its ultimate goal: offering the  discipline a central location for
              storage and retrieval of the  rapidly expanding amount of linguistic
              information on the Web.
