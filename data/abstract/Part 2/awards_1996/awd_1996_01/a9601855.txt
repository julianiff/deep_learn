Abstract    :
              9601855  Varde    The Department of Mechanical Engineering will acquire three
              ites for combustion research:  (1) a programmable dynamometer which is capable
              of loading the test engine to simulate transient conditions encountered by
              vehicles, (2) a particle image velocimetry (PIV) system that can measure
              velocity at thousands of points in a plane at any instant and provide
              quantitative results for an entire flow field, and (3) REGA FT-IR analyzer
              designed to measure various regulated and unregulated components on a real-time
              basis in exhaust gas from combustion engines.    The proposed instrumentation
              along with the existing equipment and test facilities will support basic and
              applied research in engine combustion, exhaust emission, fuels (including
              alternate fuels), combustion modeling for engine design, and automotive vapor
              compression refrigeration cycle.    The faculty members are also involved in
              developing specialized courses in combustion engines and fuels for practicing
              engineers in automotve industry.  The equipment sought in the proposal will
              help in the training of engineers in engine and fuel systems design and
              development.  ***
