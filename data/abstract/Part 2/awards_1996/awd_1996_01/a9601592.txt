Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundtion support Dr. Paul Renne and his colleagues at the
              Berkeley Geochronology Center will purchase a high sensitivity gas-source mass
              spectrometer with an ultra-low background extraction line which will be
              combined with a CO2 laser to measure 40Ar/39Ar ratios. The entire system will
              be fully automated to allow 24 hour unattended operation. 40Ar/39Ar dating has
              proven to be the most versatile means of calibrating the time interval during
              which anthropoids appeared in the paleontological record and therefore it is
              widely used by paleoanthropologists, paleontologists, geologists and
              paleobotanists. At the current time however young samples have proven difficult
              to date  and the lijmitations are imposed by analytical capabilities rather
              than physical constraints. With the new system the increased sensitivity will
              permit the Center to date materials as young as 15,000 years and also enable
              finer grained distal ashes and lower potassium materials to be dated by the
              single crystal method.   The Center is engaged in an active research program
              and both conducts field research itself and collaborates with many scientists.
              It dates samples of paleoanthropological interest from sites in Kenya and
              Ethiopia which are shedding new light on hominid origins. It also is dating
              localities in Soviet Georgia and Indonesia which have yeilded archaeological
              and fossil remains. With the new equipment not only will output be increased,
              but questions dealing, for example with the first appearance and spread of
              humans in the New World can also be addresed.
