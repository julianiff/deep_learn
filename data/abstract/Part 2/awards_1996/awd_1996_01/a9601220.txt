Abstract    :
                Auctions and procurements are used for a wide range of private and public
              transactions.  They offer conceptually simple mechanisms for price
              determination in multilateral trading.  They are typically under well-defined
              rules and rich data sets are available (though not necessarily at negligible
              direct and indirect costs, notwithstanding important issues of
              confidentiality).  Despite an increasing number of innovative empirical studies
              of auctions, there remains a substantial gap between theory and applications. 
              The reasons for this include: the questionable empirical validity of key
              assumptions; the fundamental issue of whether the participants in auctions
              actually are capable of exercising the exceptionally high degree of rationality
              assumed by theory; the inherent complexity of the mapping between unobservable
              individual valuations and the related difficulties associated with `structure`
              estimation of empirical auction models.  This research project aims at
              developing an integrated approach for the empirical analysis of auction data
              that addresses the gap between theory and applications.  The key components of
              this approach are:  The modeling of observed bidding practices in the form of
              `rules of thumbs` as operational and intuitively appealing alternatives to the
              complex Nash equilibrium strategies prescribed by theory;  The use of Monte
              Carlo simulation techniques to find those rules of thumb that perform `well` in
              the context of a specific empirical auction problem;  The development of a
              generic estimation principle capable of accommodating a broad clan of
              structural models obtained by application of (1) and (2) allowing, in
              particular, for parameteric, non parametric and semi-parametric stochastic
              formulations as deemed appropriate in the context of specific applications; and
               Empirical applications using data sets from the timber industry in the Pacific
              Northwest region and from the French aerospatial industry.
