Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at Southwest Texas State   University
              aquire a 300 MHz NMR spectrometer and workstation.  This   equipment will
              enhance research in a number of areas including the   following: (1)  
              calixarene, boron and vanadium chemistry (2) novel   polymers containing the  
              3,3-bis(trifluormethyl)-1,3-dihydro-2,1-benzoxasilole ring (3) polymers  
              resistant of atomic oxygen ablation (4)  siderophore chemistry (5)  new  
              sampling and analysis methods for isocyanates, and (6)  bacterial  
              polysaccharide tertiary structure.   Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules.    It is used to identify unknown
              substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution.  Access
              to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier   research.  The results from these NMR studies are
              useful in the areas   such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
