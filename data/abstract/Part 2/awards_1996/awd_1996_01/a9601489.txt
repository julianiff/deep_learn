Abstract    :
              9601489  Street    This grant, made through the Academic Research 
              Infrastructure (ARI) Program, provides $110,356 as  partial support of the
              costs of acquiring  instrumentation for high-resolution shear-wave 
              investigations within the New Madrid Seismic Zone  (NMSZ).  Specific equipment
              will include a Minivib  seismic source to produce both compressional and  shear
              waves at sufficient force and at frequencies  enabling penetration to 1.5-2 km
              depths, a 24-bit,  48 channel seismograph, geophones and cables, and  an
              upgrade to their current seismic processing  software that will license them to
              process  Vibroseis type data.  This high frequency source  and multi-channel
              seismograph will allow high-  resolution imaging of the semi-consolidated soils
               that lie over Paleozoic strata in the Upper  Mississippi Embayment. 
              Characterization of the  thickness of these layers and shear wave  velocities
              within these layers will provide useful  data for seismic hazard mitigation and
              engineering  purposes.  ***
