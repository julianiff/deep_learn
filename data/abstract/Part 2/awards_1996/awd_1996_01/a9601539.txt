Abstract    :
              Over the past century the United States, Britain, and Germany have taken
              different approaches to  the development of public telecommunications and have
              built different telecommunications  systems and capabilities.  To account for
              such differences in trajectory and outcome, this project  will examine how
              material, economic, cultural and social conditions have shaped the meaning of 
              telecommunications technologies.  In contrast to purely cultural studies of
              technology, this work  will look closely at the technological artifacts in
              their contexts, through comparative case studies  of components.  It will also
              analyze the strategies employed by innovators to incorporate  different groups
              of users into public telecommunications networks and will compare such 
              strategies across nations.  Finally, by examining the history of
              telecommunications to the present  the study will provide insight into the
              gains and losses society might expect from future changes.
