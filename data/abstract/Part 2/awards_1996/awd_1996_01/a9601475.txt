Abstract    :
              9601475  Wirth    This grant, made through the Academic Research  Infrastructure
              (ARI) Program, provides $110,000 as  partial support of the costs of acquiring
              an X-ray  fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) for geochemical  analyses of igneous
              and metamorphic rocks, thin  films and soils at Macalester College.  A variety 
              of research will be conducted by faculty in  several departments at Macalester
              and by members  of the Minnesota State Geological Survey and  faculty at
              Lawrence University.  Specific projects  that will utilize XRF analyses will
              include the  geochemical characterization of island arc and  intraplate
              volcanics from Alaska as indicators of  the tectonic evolution of this area,
              petrogenesis  of Proterozoic dike swarms in the Midcontinental  U.S., the
              geochemical evolution of Galapagos  hotspot magmas, characterization of silicon
              and  germanium-based thin films and trace metal  geochemistry of soils.  This
              grant provides this  undergraduate institution with a state-of-the-art  piece
              of research instrumentation which will have  a significant impact on the
              training of and fills  a regional gap where the capabilities of an XRF  were
              previously not easily accessible.  ***
