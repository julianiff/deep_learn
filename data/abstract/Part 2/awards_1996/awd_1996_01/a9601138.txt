Abstract    :
              9601136  Firman    This research examines the transformation of property rights
              to land in Ghana, the Cote d'Ivoire and cameroon during the period of colonial
              rule, when Africa was integrated into the world economy.  The project aims to
              achieve three theoretical goals.  First, it explains the origins of insecure
              land tenure in Africa.  Second, it describes the impact of British and French
              colonial institutions on the transformation of property rights - and thus
              begins to explain variation in the pattern of political and economic change
              witnessed across Africa.  Third, the project improves our theoretical
              understanding of the political process by which property rights institutions
              change, and the conditions under which those rights are made more secure.   
              The researcher uses a most similar systems research design.  She examines the
              transformation of property rights among the Akan who straddled the
              Ghanaian-Ivoirian border; and among the Bamileke, who reside in the former
              British and French portions of Cameroon.  By selecting border groups, the
              researcher holds constant variables such as ecological climate or proximity to
              urban center and isolates the effect of a single independent variable: 
              colonial institutions.  By choosing one hierarchically organized society (the
              Akan), and one decentralized society (the Bamileke), the investigator examines
              the power of rival hypotheses, which link the difference in the transformation
              of land tenure to the indigenous social structure.    The investigator relies
              on qualitative data, specifically archival data and oral interviews.  These
              data allow determination of the strategies landowners used to acquire land and
              defend that land from other claimants.  ***
