Abstract    :
              9601800  Pedraza      A laser deposition and processing system consisting of a
              high-  energy, high-repetition pulsed excimer laser and a 
              processing/deposition chamber will be established at the  University of
              Tennessee. Continuing and new research activities  supported by this
              acquisition include fundamental studies of  pulsed laser processing of ceramics
              and metal-semiconductor  couples; pulsed laser deposition and bonding of
              bioceramics to  metal alloys; photothermal and photochemical mechanisms for
              laser  activation and encapsulation; and synthesis of super-hard  materials
              using energetic laser ablation. The combination of the  laser and
              processing/deposition chamber will enhance presently  aging and outdated
              capabilities by permitting depositions to be  carried out quickly; by making
              possible combinations of film  depositions and in-situ laser processing that
              are currently  inaccessible; and by facilitating investigations at elevated 
              substrate temperatures.  %%%  The research instrumentation will be used to
              support important  materials research in the area of pulsed laser processing of
               metals and ceramics; to broaden this research by providing new  experimental
              capabilities not currently available at the  university; and to facilitate
              inter-departmental and inter-  laboratory research collaborations within the
              University of  Tennessee and with Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  ***
