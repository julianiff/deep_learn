              and other surveys are plagued by the continuing problem  of trying to elicit
              information about respondents' true behavior.   Survey questions must be
              carefully framed to accomplish the aim  of eliciting accurate information. 
              Among the specific problems  arising in survey design to be investigated are
              anchoring and  focal points.  Anchoring refers to a widely observed and well- 
              documented family effects in which presumably irrelevant cues or  settings
              provided by questions influence responses.  For example,  subjects asked to
              judge whether an uncertain quantity, such as  the length of the Amazon, exceeds
              a certain value (the anchor)  and then asked for an estimate, will typically
              give a response  that is pulled toward the anchor.  Focal point refers to a 
              rounded off, conventional response.  For example, subjects asked  for the time
              it takes them to get to work will frequently give  answers such as 5, 10, 15,
              30, 60 minutes, rather than  intermediate values, so that one observes spikes
              of responses at  these focal values even though the true values have a
              continuous  distribution.  The research will use econometric methods to infer 
              the extent of these biases and how they might be adjusted for  based on
              experiments with questionnaire design using the internet  (world-wide web) as a
              virtual laboratory.
