              Research Infrastructure: Collaborative Research Between Geological Sciences,
              Astrophysics, and Computer Science: Infrastructure Support for a Visualization
              Laboratory    This Academic Research Infrastructure award supports the
              development of high speed computational, networking, and graphics facility.   
              The research projects supported by the facility include:    1. Geophysical
              studies of mid-ocean ridges.    2. Kinematic and dynamic modeling of the
              deformation of the western United States lithosphere.    3. Geological and
              environmental fluid mechanics.    4. Characterization of fault rupture and the
              recurrence behavior of large earthquakes: and     5. Retrieving and processing
              observational astrophysical data by representing it as a virtual N-dimensional
              universe.
