Abstract    :
              This project in computational cosmology deals with studies  of inhomogeneous
              cosmological space-times in regions where  the standard linear theory of
              cosmological perturbations has  its limitations, namely super-horizon scales or
              highly non-  linear collapse of matter structures.  Prof. Laguna's  approach
              will utilize high performance computing to solve  the full non-linear set of
              Einstein's equations governing  cosmological dynamics.  This will be followed
              up with  investigations of the propagation of light in clumpy  universes. 
              Here, the emphasis will be on two topics: weak  gravitational lensing and
              polarization of the cosmic  microwave background (CMB) radiation.  This
              research is timely and complementary to previous  research in this area that
              makes little use of the full  details of modern gravitation theory.  CMB
              polarization  experiments are now being undertaken by several different 
              groups, and it will be important to understand the  implications of their
              results.
