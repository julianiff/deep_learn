Abstract    :
              9601873  Greene       We propose to purchase  a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur 
              Flow Cytometer. This system will include two laser, four-  color capability,
              and a sorting system.   Also included is a  computer, data analysis software,
              and a data storage system.  Flow cytometry is now an essential technology for
              modern  oceanographic studies. Flow cytometry is the best method for  rapid
              analysis of the picoplankton, organisms less than 2  p.m in size, which are the
              dominant autotrophic and  heterotrophic plankton in most open ocean
              environments.  Faculty in the Oceanography Department at Texas A&M  University
              currently have funded projects based in both the  North Atlantic and North
              Pacific central gyres which would  utilize the capabilities of the flow
              cytometer to analyze  picoplankton populations. Other  research projects in the
               Department of  Oceanography which  would benefit greatly  from this instrument
              include the study of the  cell division  in eukaryotic marine phytoplankton,
              the analysis of  picoplankton cultures, plankton studies using molecular 
              probes, coastal studies of nitrifying bacteria, and stable  isotope studies of
              the microbial loop.  An annual training  course in the theory and use of the
              flow cytometer would be  offered to undergraduate and graduate students, and
              this  facility will be used to attract graduate students to Texas  A&M.  A plan
              for management of the facility is also  outlined.  ***
