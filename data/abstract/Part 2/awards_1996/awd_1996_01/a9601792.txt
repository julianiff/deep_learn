Abstract    :
              9601792  Browning    A scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) with
              high  resolution Z-contrast imaging capabilities will be acquired by  the
              University of Illinois at Chicago. Users of the instrument  span a range of
              disciplines in both the physical and life  sciences at  the university  and at
              other academic institutions  and industrial laboratories in the Chicago area.
              The instrument  will support research in a variety of material systems
              including  superconductors, semiconductors, ceramics, metals, polymers, high- 
              temperature materials, and biomaterials.  %%%  The atomic resolution microscope
              incorporates technology  developed in the last few years. This will be a unique
              research  facility in the Chicago area and one of a few comparable  facilities
              in the country.  ***
