Abstract    :
              Of all the challenges in post-communist transitions, none has been more
              difficult to manage than the resurgence of ethnonationalism.  The unraveling of
              Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and the USSR speaks of the risks of opening the
              political arena.  The rise of ethnic conflicts underscores how easily claims
              for sovereignty can spread across groups and regions, and from central to
              regional and local governments.  Even when the breakup of the state has
              involved relatively little violence, as in the USSR, the conflicts raise
              serious questions about whether multiethnic successor states can survive the
              post-communist transition intact.  In Russia, many of the same problems that
              dissolved the Soviet Union now challenge the federal government.  Liberal
              reformers have come to see ethnonationalism as a major threat to
              democratization -- inimical to the spirit of tolerance and the concern for
              individual rights that liberal democracy requires.  Yet the level and character
              of ethnonational mobilization in non-Russian territories is far from clear and
              its connection to support for democratization even less so.  This project
              examines the nature and level of ethnonationalism and support for
              democratization in three regions of the Russian Federation: Northern Ossetia,
              Tatarstan and Sakha.  Mass surveys will be conducted and contextual data will
              be attached to all individual level responses.  The project will produce a
              dataset of 3,000 individual interviews to be archived at the completion of the
              research project.
