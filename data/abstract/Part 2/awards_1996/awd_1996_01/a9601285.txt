Abstract    :
              9601285  Peterson  The maize P gene encodes a Myb-homologous transcriptional
              regulator of three genes for flavonoid pigment biosynthesis in certain maize
              floral organs. The P-rr allele specifies pigmentation of both the kernel
              pericarp and cob glumes, while the P-wr allele pigments the cob glumes but not
              the kernel pericarps. The mechanism(s) leading to organ-specific expression of
              the P-wr allele will be investigated. It has been found that both tissues
              contain P-wr transcripts although the pericarps are colorless and the cob
              glumes are red. It has also been determined that the proteins encoded by these
              two alleles differ at two positions outside the Myb DNA binding domain and by a
              truncation and replacement at the C-terminus. A particle-gun based transient
              assay system will be used to determine which changes in the P-wr protein are
              responsible for organ-specific expression. In addition to transient assays the
              in vivo expression pattern of the P-wr allele will be studied by expressing the
              P-wr cDNA in transgenic plants. It has been found that the P-wr locus contains
              a repetitive DNA consisting of approximately 5 copies of a 12.6 kb DNA sequence
              and the genomic organization of the locus will be further investigated. The
              functional P-wr gene will be identified by the use of a Ds insertion. cDNA
              clones from two additional P gene alleles will be sequenced and their
              responsiveness to UFO, a trans-modifier of P-wr expression, will be studied. 
              %%%  The results of this study will help to elucidate fundamental regulatory
              mechanisms which produce specific patterns of gene expression during plant
              development.  ***
