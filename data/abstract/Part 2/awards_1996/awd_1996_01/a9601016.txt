Abstract    :
                    9601016  VandenBosch  This award provides partial support for a Conference
              on Emerging Model Legum Systems - Tools and Advances.  The meeting will take
              place July 12 - 14, 1996 in Knoxville, Tennessee, immediately prior to the 8th
              International Congress on Molecular-Plant Microbe Interactions.  The meeting
              has two objectives: (A) to present a discussion of tools for genetic and
              molecular analysis, plus selected advances which have applied these approaches,
              and (B) to foster communication and interactions among researchers working on
              diploid annual legumes as model systems.  The format for the gathering will
              include invited and contributed talks and discussion sections.  Several means
              are planned to communicate the proceedings of the conference, including a
              meeting review article in The Plant Cell and the establishment of a home page
              for model legumes  The last five years have seen an increased interest in model
              systems to facilitate genetic and molecular genetic analysis of development in
              legumes.  This meeting will bring together researchers from all over the world
              to discuss how to coordinate activities of all interested parties.
