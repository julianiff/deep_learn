Abstract    :
              Hopkins, Lewis  U of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign   This proposal is for research
              which examines the ways in which developers respond to information revealed
              through government plans specifically for transportation.  A model will be
              developed which examines the plans for a light rail system in Metropolitan
              Portland, Oregon.  Measures used to evaluate responses include spatial and
              temporal changes in land sales, land values, building permits, and land
              improvements.  A parcel level, date stamped data base is developed in which
              transactions on landowner decisions and land values over time are recorded.  In
              the analysis of the impact of government plans, an animated GIS capability is
              invoked over time to explore spatial and temporal lags among plan information,
              regulatory or infrastructure actions, and private development decisions.  The
              research is grounded in a theoretical model and focuses upon the temporal
              interrelationship between the decisions of developers and local governments as
              a dynamic Stackleberg model of urban development.  The proposed work also
              includes a rich variety of empirical analysis options.  The research will
              extend understanding of the impact of government actions upon developers'
              behavior and will also deepen the theoretical literature on urban development.
