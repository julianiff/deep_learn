Abstract    :
              9601625  Weller       The Vector Measuring  Current Meter  (VMCM) was  developed
              by Drs. Robert Weller and  Russ Davis and  commercially produced by EG&G
              Sealink System.  According to  the PIs, the science requirements for high
              quality vector  measurements in the near surface region near buoys continue  to
              increase and the VMCM propeller current meter is  recognized as the current
              standard.  The problem is that the  VMCM is no longer commercially available
              and the data  recorder and reader, originally manufactured by Sea Data  Corp,
              are  also no longer available or repairable. This  proposal seeks funding to
              redesign the vector measuring  circuitry, data acquisition and storage
              components so as to  provide a new, lighter, flexible, inexpensive and low
              power  instrument.  Replacement of aging tape recorders will  increase data
              return.  Reduction of size and weight will  permit the use of the VMCM on new
              mooring designs, such as  horizontal arrays.   The project will permit the over
              40  EG&G Sea Link, Inc.  VMCMs that the Upper Ocean Processes  group uses, as
              well as those within the rest of the  oceanographic community to be used
              reliably into the next  decade.  WHOI's cost share of $159,000 represents 51%
              of the  total cost for this project.  ***
