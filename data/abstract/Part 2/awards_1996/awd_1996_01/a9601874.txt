              Research Infrastructure: Acquisition of a CAVE: Breaking Research and Education
              Barriers by Developing 3-D Visualization CAVE Technology    This Academic
              Research Infrastructure award supports the acquisition of a virtual environment
              laboratory incorporating the CAVE immersive virtual reality system.    The
              projects supported by this equipment include:    1. User interfaces using
              immersive VR.    2. Visualization of scientific phenomena.    3. Molecular
              modeling applications.    4. General research on human centered systems enabled
              by immersive virtual reality.
