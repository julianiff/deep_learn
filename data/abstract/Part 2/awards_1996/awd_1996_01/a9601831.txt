Abstract    :
              This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will   assist
              the Department of Chemistry at the University of California   Riverside upgrade
              the existing 500 MHz NMR.  This equipment will enhance   research in a number
              of areas including the following:  (1)  human   erythrocytes, disulfide bonds
              in peptides and the interaction of peptides   with heparin (2)  structural
              studies of vitamin D in vitamin D-protein   complexes (3)  determination of
              non-standard nucleic acid structures (4)    investigation of the roles played
              by low-barrier hydrogen bonds in enzyme   catalysis, and (5) 
              structure-function relationships for macromolecular   structures of biological
              significance.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
              molecules.    It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific 
               arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of  
              interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art   NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research.
               The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas   such as polymers,
              catalysis, and in biology.
