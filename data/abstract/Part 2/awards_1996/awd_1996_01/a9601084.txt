Abstract    :
              9601084  Shu      This award supports collaboration in applied mathematics, 
              specifically on finite volume method and Runge-Kutta  discontinuous Galerkin
              method for hyperbolic conservation  laws.  Chi-Wang Shu, Brown University,
              Division of Applied  Mathematics, and Li Yinfan, Department of Computational 
              Mathematics, Chinese Academy of Sciences together with Lu  Ruxun, Mathematics
              Department, University of Science and  Technology, Hefei, propose to conduct
              research on various  projects related to development of numerical algorithms
              with  high order of accuracy.  The cooperation will be carried on  through
              exchange of visits and of students.    Finite volume method and finite element
              method are two of  the main classes of numerical methods frequently used to 
              solve differential equations arising from fluid dynamics and  other areas of
              computational physics and computational  engineering, such as semiconductor
              device simulations.  The  US and Chinese researchers in this project will
              jointly  study these two types of methods, compare their relative  merit in
              different situations, and apply the method to  computational fluid dynamics
              problems and other problems in  computational physics.  The US investigator's
              expertise in  finite difference method, and in applications in various  fields
              of computational physics is complemented by the  Chinese expertise in algorithm
              development and analysis.  The Chinese side also brings established research
              groups to  the project, providing an additional pool of research  support.
