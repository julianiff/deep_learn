              Research Infrastructure:  Acquisition of an ATM-based Parallel Computing
              Infrastructure    This Academic Research Infrastructure award supports the
              acquisition of a dedicated, heterogeneous, high speed computer network for the
              support of research projects in:    1. Networked based distributed computing
              (CROWN project).  2. Distributed computing in VLSI CAD.  3. ATM network
              performance in a mixed traffic environment.
