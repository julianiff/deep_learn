Abstract    :
              9601345  Jung    Systems-level analyses of the neuronal control of rhythmic 
              behavioral patterns in animals is not far advanced.  Most of  the earlier work
              on this problem is based on mapping of  neuronal interactions.  It has become
              evident that  mathematical and computational techniques will be required  to
              achieve a quantitative understanding of central nervous  function. The long
              term goal of the research funded by this  grant is to understand the
              interactions between the neural  circuitry in the brain and spinal cord that
              underlie motor  control.  Specific experiments are to examine the nature of 
              variability in the locomotor rhythms of primitive intact  vertebrates and to
              examine the response of these animals to  external perturbations.   Analytical
              techniques include  linear and non-linear signal analysis to find temporal 
              correlations, variability, stability, and intersegmental  coordination.  In
              addition, techniques from dynamical  systems theory, such as bifurcation
              analysis and  perturbation analysis, will be used to analyze the behavior  of
              neural network models of  the central pattern generator.    This research is
              expect to lead to an improved understanding  of the coordinating mechanisms
              that are used by biological  systems.  Such improved understanding of
              biological control  systems could also be the basis for the development of new,
               biologically-inspired methodologies to control of cyclic  processes in
              engineering systems, for example, for robotic  locomotion.
