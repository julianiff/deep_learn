Abstract    :
                    Selection of food often involves mechanosensory information about texture
              along with chemosensory information about flavor.  Aquatic crustaceans such as
              crayfish and lobster have antennae, antennules and mouthparts with many sensory
              hairlike structures called sensilla, which often are receptors for chemosensory
              as well as mechanical stimuli.  These animals provide an excellent model system
              for study because the few nerve cells in each sensilla are very easily
              accessible for recording nerve activity, to determine how they respond to
              different stimuli.  This project uses anatomical and electrophysiological
              techniques to explore how these sensory structures are innervated and to help
              understand how responses to mechanical hydrodynamic flow around the receptors
              interact with responses to chemosensory stimuli.  Results will clarify how
              multi-modal signals about the environment are normally integrated by the
              nervous system to produce appropriate behavior.     This work will have an
              impact not only on chemosensory and mechanosensory science, but on
              understanding information coding in general in the nervous system with
              potential relevance to robotic sensors, on understanding sensory evolution and
              how organisms adapt to their environment, and may lead to applied advances in
              animal stock management in the fisheries industry.
