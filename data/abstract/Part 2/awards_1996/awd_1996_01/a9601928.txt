Abstract    :
              9601928  Curran  University of Pittsburgh  This award from the Academic Research
              Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at the
              University of Pittsburgh to acquire an upgrade of the existing 500 MHz NMR, new
              consoles for three existing 300 MHz NMRs and construction of a computer network
              for all the NMR computing resources. This equipment will enhance research in a
              number of areas including the following: (1) organic synthesis - development of
              new synthetic methods and mechanistic organic chemistry; total synthesis of
              marine natural products; radical chemistry and synthesis of therapeutically
              important target molecules (2) molecular recognition and bioorganic chemistry -
              new syntheses of host-guest systems and new molecular complexes and
              self-assembling systems; mechanisms of action of vitamins K and E, non-kekule
              molecules and free radical ring expansion; investigations of DNA duplexes and
              photoacoustic calorimetry (3)  inorganic chemistry - conjugation in inorganic
              molecules; investigating photochemistry of Mo(V) oxo bridges dimers and (4) 
              polymer chemistry - studies of polymer surfactants of uncommon architecture;
              ring-opening metathesis polymerization and chemical recycling.    Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to
              chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
              identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
              solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
              who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are
              useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
