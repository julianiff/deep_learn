Abstract    :
              The PIs will build three Hi-throughput Imaging Echelle spectrograph (Hi-TIES)
              instruments to demonstrate visible tomography of cusp emissions.  They will use
              a CCD detector suitable for cusp application, to be presented in a campaign
              type mode.  The key objectives are (1) to provide extensive data of sunlit cusp
              emissions for extended periods using a newly developed capability, complemented
              by other ground-based and space based instruments, and (2) to provide a
              hands-on interdisciplinary research training ground for graduate students, with
              a mix of experimental and modeling and data analyses components.
