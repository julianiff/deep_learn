Abstract    :
              SBR-96001170    This award supports a detailed study to evaluate the climatic
              signal contained within the magnetic data from loess deposits of the central
              Great Plains, and to use these data in conjunction with nonmagnetic data to
              establish, to the extent possible, a quantitative link with climate.  There are
              four specific objectives:  to assess the mechanisms by which the loessal
              sediments attain the climatic signal in their magnetic record;  to demonstrate
              how magnetic parameters and delta-13 C (a nonmagnetic, climate-sensitive
              parameter) vary stratigraphically and regionally;  to extract temporal and
              regional climatic information;  and to develop a time-stratigraphic framework
              for comparing the regional and global climate records.      Temporally, the
              study includes three paleosols and modern soils, covering the Last
              Interglacial, Last Glacial Maximum of the Wisconsinian, and the Holocene
              climatic episodes.  Spatially, the study includes sites located along two
              transects:  the north-south transect yields a temperature gradient and the
              east-west transect yields a moisture gradient.  Sites at the four end points of
              the transects will be studied intensively, with close-interval measurements of
              all parameters.  Then, less-intensive data collection along the transects will
              serve to monitor change along them.    Loess deposits are proving to be one of
              the best sources of detailed Quaternary climatic records on the continents. 
              This project should improve the regional record of climate history and should
              provide theoretical, methodological, and technical improvements in loess
              studies in other settings.
