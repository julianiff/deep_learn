Abstract    :
              This research project will fill an important gap in the description of human
              genetic variation - a  comprehensive analysis of genetic materials from Island
              Melanesia, focusing on mitochondrial  DNA and Y chromosome loci.  As Sykes re-
              cently suggested, Island Melanesia is the key to  understanding early
              population migrations in the Pacific region.  It is well known for its 
              linguistic and genetic diversity, but newer techniques have not been applied to
              genetic analyses  on samples from this region in any significant way. The
              pattern of variation revealed by this  study in mtDNA and Y chromosome DNA will
              be used to estimate the timing and nature of the  initial and subsequent
              peoplings of Island Melane- sia, and Melanesia's relation to the  surrounding
              Polynesian, Southeast Asian, and Australian poulations.  The analyses will be 
              performed on a total of 800 unrelated individuals from a chain of islands
              stretching from the  coast of New Guinea out into the Pacific, including: New
              Britain, New Ireland, and  Bougainville.    There are also ramifications from
              this study for estimation of the time of first appearance of  modern humans.
