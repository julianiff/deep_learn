Abstract    :
              9601151  Bennett    One key to accumulating knowledge in the social sciences is
              the regular testing of theories against one another to determine when a new
              theory has superseded previous ones.  However, while political science has
              numerous theories that claim to explain novel facts, these theories are rarely
              compared systematically.  In this project the researchers perform a broad and
              inclusive comparative statistical test of  the major theories of international
              conflict.  The test is applied to both the initiation of militarized disputes
              between countries and the escalation of those disputes to war.  Such a broad
              comparative test is useful and necessary for accumulating scientific knowledge
              about international conflict.  The researchers will find that information from
              multiple levels of analysis is necessary to accurately model conflict behavior.
               The researchers use a series of relative power tests to show which theories
              account for more international conflict outcomes than others, suggesting the
              relative importance of tested theories.  ***
