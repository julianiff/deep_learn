Abstract    :
                    9601674  Sutterer  This is an equipment award, to (1) retrofit and an
              existing 1334  kN tension/compression universal testing machine (UTM) for 
              digital, closed loop control, (2) development of a triaxial  testing system for
              specimens up to 560 mm (22 in.) in diameter,  and (3) acquisition of a 32
              channel data acquisition system with  re-usable strain gages for ongoing
              research and teaching.  The  load frame, which is capable of testing columns
              and panels up to  4.3 m (14 ft) long, is in excellent condition, but the
              hydraulic  power unit and manual control valving is outdated and in need of 
              repair.  ***
