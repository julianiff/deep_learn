Abstract    :
              This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will   assist
              the Department of Chemistry at Georgetown University acquire a   computer
              system. This equipment will enhance research in a number of   areas including
              the following: (1)  molecular modeling of the electronic   structure and
              vibrational spectra of conducting polymers (2)  theoretical   studies of NMR
              chemical shifts and shift tensors in Conus peptides (3)   molecular modeling in
              organized media  (4) modeling interactions of   polyoxometalates with
              biomolecules  (5) stereoselectivity in the   formation of chiral transition
              metal-enolate complexes, and (6) new   approach to identification of free
              radicals    A workstation network of fast , modern computer workstations is a
              new way   to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a
              `computer   network` also serves as a development environment for new
              theoretical   codes and algorithms, provides state-of-art graphics and
              visualization   facilities, and supports research in state-of-the-art
              applications of   parallel processing.
