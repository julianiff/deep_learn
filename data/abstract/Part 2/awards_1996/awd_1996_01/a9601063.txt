Abstract    :
              9601063  Roye    The principal investigator in this study will use an 
              invertebrate model (the commercially important blue crab) to  study nerve cells
              in a central nervous system that organize  a well defined behavior occurring in
              a single body appendage  (withdrawal of the first segmental appendage, the 
              antennule).  He will use appropriate modern techniques  (intracellular
              recording, fluorescent dyes injection, etc.)  to identify and map each cell
              involved to the production of  this particular behavior.  A great benefit of
              the model used  is that each cell in the neural network under investigation 
              can be identified as a unique entity present in all blue  crabs.    Studies of
              this type are important if a real understanding  of how the behaviors generally
              (including those of man) are  created by brain neural networks.  The potential
              value of a  complete understanding of the form and function of neural  networks
              that produce behavior is enormous, with implication  for computer design, robot
              fabrication, etc.
