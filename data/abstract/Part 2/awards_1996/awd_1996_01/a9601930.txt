Abstract    :
              9601930  Lerner-Lam    This grant, made through the Academic Research 
              Infrastructure (ARI) Program, provides $500,000 as  one-half support of the
              costs of acquiring a very  large mass storage system for earth and 
              environmental research at the Lamont Doherty Earth  Observatory.  Specifically,
              the equipment will  include roughly 10.5 terabytes (TB) of mass  storage, of
              which, 500 GB will be concentrated in  high speed file servers and a serial
              storage  architecture (SSA) disk and the remaining 10 TB of  storage will be
              accommodated by digital tape  through a "juke box" system.  This mass storage 
              system will serve both the IBM scalable parallel  supercomputer (SP2) at Lamont
              and a network of 140  high performance workstations for this group's  data
              intensive research including, reflection and  refraction seismology, numerical
              modeling of the  geophysical fluid dynamics of the Earth's mantle,  climate
              dynamics and exploration and near-surface  geophysics.  ***
