Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative research and education project which has the following
              goals: 1) producing and publishing a textbook designed to provide practical
              support for secondary school teachers who wish to incorporate topics in ethics
              and values in their curricula; 2) exploring state and national science
              curricula  to identify opportunities for introducing ethics and values the
              primary and middle school grades; 3) developing ethics and values in science
              lessons in the junior and senior high ; 4) begin exploring and testing the
              feasibility of integrating ethics and values in science lessons at the
              elementary school level; and 5) developing models for summer institutes and/or
              in-service instructional programs designed to provide the education, support
              and encouragement needed to promote the teaching of ethics and values at all
              levels. The textbook for secondary school teachers will include introductory
              education sections on effective means of introducing junior and senior high
              school students to the study of moral and value-laden aspects of the practice
              and uses of science in society.  This material will be based on the experience
              gained by the principal investigators during the summer institute program,
              their prior experience in teaching ethics and the rapidly growing literature on
              the teaching of ethics using case studies, role-playing and other pedagogical
              techniques.  The principal investigators, a philosopher with considerable
              successful experience in teaching ethics to grade school children and an
              environmental scientist who has taught ethics and values in science to both
              college students and high school teachers, will take advantage of their mutual
              sabbatical leaves to educate each other and work together on this project.
