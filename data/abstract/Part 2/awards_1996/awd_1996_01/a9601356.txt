Abstract    :
                The  functional and structural mapping of brain between  different modalities,
               subjects  and  developmental  stages  will  be  made possible  by  the 
              research described in this  proposal.  We  will develop  algorithms to
              spatially deform  data from varied  sources so  that  they  become comparable. 
              In addition to permitting  the direct  comparison  of these  data, the
              resulting  transformations and   statistics  of  variation  will  allow  us  to
               model   the differences  between and within subjects and modalities.  Accurate
               modelling  is  essential to the elucidation of  the  relationship between
              anatomy and physiology as recorded in  multiple modalities and subjects, and
              across time.    The parameterization, warping and morphing / blending of 3D 
              brain data will be accomplished using our Adaptive  algorithms. Adaptive
              algorithms  will be influenced by  contextual cues  from  anatomic region  or 
              imaging  modality. There are 5 categories of  adaptive  characteristics
              (Anatomic, Tissue, Densitometric, Geometric,  and Other)  that  will  be 
              tested with each type  of  transformation (adaptive parameterization, warping 
              transformation and morphing / blending.
