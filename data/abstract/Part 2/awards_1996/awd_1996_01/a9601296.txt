Abstract    :
                   Chaos is the generic term used to describe the irregular and  unpredictable
              time evolution of physical systems.  In classical  mechanics, chaos may be
              defined in terms of the behavior of  nearby particle trajectories.  Since
              classical mechanics can be  thought of as a special case of quantum mechanics,
              it is of  interest to know how the irregularity of a classically chaotic 
              system, influences the dynamics of the corresponding quantum  system.  One of
              the trade marks of quantum mechanics is the  quantization of energy levels.  It
              now seems apparent that chaos  manifests itself in the distribution of the
              energy levels.  A  distribution of energy levels presupposes that the energy
              levels  are discrete.  However, if the electron is nearly stripped from  its
              nucleus, the widths of the energy level spacings essentially  go to zero and
              the energies become continuous.  Continuous  energies are also present in
              unbound quantum systems like the  model studied in this project, the Hydrogen
              atom in an external  magnetic field which is perpendicular to an electric
              field.  This  work will address how one looks for signatures of chaos in this 
              model.  We plan to check the validity of the meaning of the  energy level
              distribution in an important energy range that has  not been previously
              investigated.
