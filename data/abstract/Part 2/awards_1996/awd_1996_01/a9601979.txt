Abstract    :
                  96-01979    Houston    The PIs propose an interdisciplinary study of the
              nature of deep earthquakes.  This research  will test the validity of the
              proposed mechanism of transformation-induced faulting that  accompanies the
              metastable phase change from olivine to spinel in subducting lithospheric 
              slabs.  Laboratory microstructural and rheological experiments and
              seismological studies will  be continued and will be enhanced by geodynamic
              modeling studies at both laboratory  (micromechanical modeling of the
              transformation-induced instability) and earth scales  (large-scale thermal and
              mechanical modeling).  Understanding the failure mechanism of  deep earthquakes
              is important for determining the internal mineralogical structure of 
              subducting slabs and identifying the driving forces for convection in the
              earth's mantle.  ***
