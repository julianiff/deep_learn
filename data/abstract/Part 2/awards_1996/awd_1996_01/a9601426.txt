Abstract    :
              9601426  Wiescher  This proposal requests NSF support, to partially cover costs
              for  student support for the fourth international symposium on "Nuclei  in the
              Cosmos" to be held at the University of Notre Dame on June  20-27, 1996.  This
              symposium continues the tradition of the  meetings held previously at Baden bei
              Wien, Austria (1990),  Karlsruhe, Germany (1992), and Assergi at the Gran
              Sasso, Italy  (1994).  The 1996 meeting will be the first in the United States.
               This symposium is widely recognized as the main forum for  experimentalists,
              theorists, and observers to evaluate the  current status as well as the future
              directions in the field of  Nuclear Astrophysics.  ***
