Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks to acquire instrumentation needed to facilitate  genomics
              research on  the Purdue University campus. Purdue University has undertaken
              several  important initiatives over the past 7 years that have provided 
              substantial strength to genetics research. These include the  construction and
              renovation of significant laboratory space,  establishment of an
              interdisciplinary graduate training program in  genetics, and the hiring of
              several genetics faculty with expertise  spanning a broad and exciting range of
              topics. This growing momentum  has now appropriately positioned Purdue
              University for the  establishment of the Purdue Genomics Laboratory (PGL). Such
              a  laboratory, once equipped for high throughput genomics data generation  and
              analysis, will serve three important objectives: To support  genomics research
              efforts of 8 primary users, to serve as a student  training facility in support
              of a NSF-sponsored graduate training  effort in plant genetics, and to
              facilitate collaborative linkages for  the application of DNA-based
              methodologies to plant improvement. The  instrumentation needed to meet these
              objectives includes an electronic  autoradiography system, an automated DNA
              sequencing system with  molecular biology labstation, a gel documentation
              system, CHEF mapping  systems, thermocyclers, -80C freezer equipment, and plant
              growth  chamber facilities. This equipment, once in place, would allow the 
              initiation of several large-scale genomics research projects in  important
              plant and fimgal genomes that, to date, have not been  well-characterized. At
              present, the lack of these facilities on the  Purdue campus are all that stand
              in the way of these valuable research  endeavors.
