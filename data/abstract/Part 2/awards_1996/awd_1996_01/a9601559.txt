Abstract    :
                       This is a project of research in syntactic theory, within the general
              framework known as  the "Minimalist Program" (MP).  The aim of the MP is to
              simplify radically the assumptions and the  mechanisms of the
              "Government-and-Binding" (GB) theoretical framework which was the lineal 
              antecedent of MP, while continuing to account for the empirical data the GB
              handles successfully.             In this particular project, the investigators
              will focus on developing a satisfactory  theoretical account of the properties
              of quantified expressions, like "every child" or "many books".  
              Interpretations of sentences containing two or more such expressions show that
              they interact in  interesting ways, especially with respect to their "scope",
              which may be wide or narrow.  The topic  to be investigated here will be
              whether structural patterns which need to be posited for other  purposes, such
              as assignment of case categories to noun phrases, can be exploited to give the
              right  results in interpreting quantified expressions, without the need of the
              somewhat elaborate machinery  for their interpretation which has evolved in the
              GB framework.
