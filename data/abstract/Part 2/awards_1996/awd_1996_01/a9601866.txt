Abstract    :
              9601866  Selassie  Pomona College  This award from the Academic Research
              Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at Pomona
              College acquire computer workstations and attendant software packages. This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following:
              (1) dynamical theory of reactive processes in pillared smectite clays and
              zeolites (2)  intramolecular hydrogen bonding in DMSO solution (3) 3D-QSAR
              studies of receptor-ligand interactions (4)  enzymatic reactions in non-aqueous
              solutions, and (5) re-analysis of quantitative structure-activity relationships
              using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA).      A network of fast,
              modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the computing needs of
              chemistry departments.  Such a "computer network" also serves as a development
              environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-art
              graphics and visualization facilities, and supports research in
              state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing.
