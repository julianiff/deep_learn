Abstract    :
              Gordon  9601916      The functioning of the nervous system depends on an
              intricate  network of connections between cells.  Much of the communication 
              occurs at tiny physical contacts between cells called synapses.   Learning and
              memory are thought to involve changes in the strength  of the communication
              through collections of synapses.  It is  therefore important to understand how
              synapses are built and  function by dissecting them into their component
              molecules.  A well  defined model system for this research is the neuromuscular
               junction, a large isolated synapse between a motor neuron and a  muscle fiber.
               Several molecules identified originally at the  neuromuscular junction have
              now been found at synapses throughout  the nervous system, suggesting common
              molecular mechanisms  underlying synapse formation and maintenance.  Dr. Gordon
               identified chondroitin sulfate, a carbohydrate component found  attached to
              molecules on the muscle cell surface, plays important  roles in the molecular
              organization and development of the synapse.   Further studies are examining
              the role of chondroitin sulfate in  both the structure of the synapse and in
              signaling required for  synapse formation.  The studies provide an exciting
              opportunity to  identify new components of the synapse and to gain enhanced 
              understanding of the mechanisms governing communication between  nerve cells in
              the brain.
