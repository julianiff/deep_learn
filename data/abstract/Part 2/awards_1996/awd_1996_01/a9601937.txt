Abstract    :
              9601937  Farmer  Building on their strong research program on silicon wafer
              processing, micromachining, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), electrical
              and optical characterization, and related areas over the past eighteen months,
              NJIT researchers have investigated specifically the process of bonding
              ultra-thin silicon wafers (as thin as 2 micrometers), a product of Virginia
              Semiconductor, Inc. (VSI), to virgin and oxidized silicon substrates.  This
              work has recently culminated in a joint patent application for a bonded
              structure using ultra-thin silicon, and a commitment by VSI to supply
              ultra-thin wafers for continued research, both on the processes and mechanisms
              of ultra-thin wafer bonding, and on MEMS, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and
              silicon-on-silicon (SOS) applications.  Through the Academic Research
              Infrastructure Program, NJIT is seeking to expand its research efforts in
              ultra-thin silicon wafer bonding.  ***
