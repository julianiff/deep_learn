Abstract    :
              9601632  Bramley, Randall  McMullen, Donald F.  Indiana University    Academic
              Research Infrastructure: Acquisition of a Distributed Computation and Immersive
              Visualization Environment for Complex Systems    This Academic Research
              Infrastructure award supports the acquisition of a high speed SMD computing
              system operating at a peak speed of approximately 15 GFLops.    The research
              projects supported by the equipment include:    1. The computational study of
              gravitational instabilities in realistic protostellar disks.    2. The
              computational study of collisional stellar systems.    3. Gravitational
              lensing.    4. Schrodinger equations for molecules.    5. Sedimentary basin and
              whole planet evolution modeling.    6. Quantum chromodynamics.    7. Global
              illumination simulations of complete, large scale structures (bridges, etc.).
