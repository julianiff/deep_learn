Abstract    :
              9601971  Shirts  Brigham Young University  This award from the Academic Research
              Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry &
              Biochemistry at Brigham Young University acquire a server for the existing
              computer system. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including the following: (1)  statistical mechanics of liquids and colloids
              including inhomogeneous liquids using higher-order integral equations (2) 
              molecular modeling of macrocyclic ligands for separations and semiclassical
              quantization of rovibrational spectra of highly-excited polyatomic molecules
              (3)  molecular modeling of enantioselective binding of organic guests by
              cyclodextrin hosts, and  (4)  molecular dynamics of selective cation binding to
              charged and polar sites in proteins.      A network of fast , modern computer
              workstations is a new way to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry
              departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a development environment
              for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-art graphics and
              visualization facilities, and supports research in state-of-the-art
              applications of parallel processing.
