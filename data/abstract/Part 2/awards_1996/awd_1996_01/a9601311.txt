Abstract    :
              The goal of the proposed research is to increase understanding of the social
              psychological underpinnings of language production and comprehension.  A major
              focus of this research will be on conversational indirectness.  People
              frequently convey their meaning indirectly, and the phenomenon has important
              implications for both cognitive psychology and social psychology.  Most
              previous research on indirectness has examined requests, a relatively unique
              type of remark.  The present proposal will extend this research by examining
              the production and comprehension of utterances that function as replies. 
              Several experiments will be conducted to examine six general issues.  First,
              how can speakers respond indirectly to questions and requests?  Second, how are
              indirect replies interpreted, and what role does the interpersonal context play
              in this process?  Third, does the comprehension of indirect replies involve an
              inference process, or are these remarks recognized in a relatively automatic
              fashion?  Fourth, what is the role played by paralinguistic cues such as
              response hesitation in the comprehension of indirect replies?  Fifth, do
              hearers make any other inferences as a function of a speaker's remarks, and if
              so how do they do so?  Sixth, do people differ in terms of how they comprehend
              the meaning of others' remarks?  The research will shed new light on
              interpersonal relationships, and the unique role of language in how people
              understand and interact with one another.
