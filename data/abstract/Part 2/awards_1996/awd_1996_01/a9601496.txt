Abstract    :
              9601496  Falcone    A sub-picosecond x-ray scattering facility will be developed
              at a  synchrotron beamline at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence  Berkeley
              Laboratory. This is a collaborative effort between the  University of
              California at Berkeley, the University of Michigan,  and Lawrence Berkeley
              Laboratory. The facility incorporates an  ultrafast x-ray streak camera on the
              x-ray beamline. This fast  detector will then be used to study rapidly evolving
              x-ray  diffraction patterns from ordered materials that are impulsively 
              perturbed by energy from an ultrashort pulse laser. The dynamics  of melting
              and other structural phase transitions will be probed  in this way.  %%%  The
              research will result in a unique facility for ultrafast  studies of structural
              phase transitions by x-ray scattering. The  facility fills a current need at
              synchrotron sources of  techniques for carrying out real-time studies in a
              short time  scale. The x-ray streak camera development has potential for 
              transferring the technology to the commercial sector.  ***
