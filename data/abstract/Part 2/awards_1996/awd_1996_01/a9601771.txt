Abstract    :
              9601771  Elsenbaumer  University of Texas Arlington  This award from the
              Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI)  Program will assist the Chemistry and
              Biochemistry Department at the University of Texas at Arlington to acquire an
              NMR spectrometer.  This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including the following: (1)  stereochemically pure and robust
              metallodendrimers (2)   chemistry of fluorinated poly(pyrazolyl)borate ligands
              (3) studies of phosphorus compounds (4)  conformational isomerism in
              heterocyclic sulfonium ylides (5)  electrically conductive polymers, and  (6) 
              development of highly conductive polyaniline.     Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
              (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
              state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
              frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
              such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology
