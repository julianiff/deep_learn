Abstract    :
              9601783  Frost    This grant, made through the Academic Research  Infrastructure
              (ARI) Program, provides $250,000 as  one-half support of the costs of acquiring
              a  thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) with  ion counting capabilities
              for use in isotopic  studies of igneous petrogenesis, thermochronology  and
              geochronology for tectonic studies, and  environmental isotope geochemistry at
              the  University of Wyoming.  The instrument will  replace a somewhat antiquated
              VG TIMS purchased in  1984 but more recently upgraded in 1989.  However,  since
              the upgrade, the instrument has been plagued  with technical problems that have
              only more  recently (1993) been rectified and data produced.  The 50% match
              from the University of Wyoming is  part of a one-time, $18M state supported
              Geology  building expansion/improvement. Specific studies  that will utilize
              the capabilities of this new  TIMS will include research on the petrogenesis of
               the Laramie Anorthosite Complex and Aleutian and  Caribbean arc magmas through
              examination of Pb, Sr  and Nd isotopic signatures, the tectonic evolution  of
              the Western U.S. based on thermochronologic and  geochronologic techniques and
              Sr and Nd isotopic  studies of groundwater hydrology and weathering  processes.
