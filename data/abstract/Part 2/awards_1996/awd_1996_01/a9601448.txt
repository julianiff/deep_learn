Abstract    :
                We are submitting this proposal to conduct a two-and-one-  half day "First
              International Symposium on Molecular  Dynamics of Biomembranes".  The
              University of North Carolina  at chapel Hill and Duke University will host this
              meeting of  experts in computer simulations, computational chemistry, 
              structural biology, biomembrane structure, and high  performance computing as
              the first in a planned series of  "Triangle Biophysics Symposium".  This
              symposium will bring  together the ideas and expertise of leading researchers
              in  these areas, and will be highlighted by a poster session  (both traditional
              and electronic) to view and discuss the  latest developments in the molecular
              dynamics of membrane  systems.
