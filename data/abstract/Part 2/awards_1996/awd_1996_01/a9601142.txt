Abstract    :
              This purpose of this project is to hold two conferences on the  state of
              empirical economics organized around chapters written  for Volume V of the
              Handbook of Econometrics, the empirical and  applied complement to the
              recently-published Volume IV.  The goal  of the volume is to provide an
              up-to-date account of views of  best practice empirical research in economics. 
              The target  audience is the applied econometrics community.  The first 
              function of this targeting is to improve the practice of  econometrics by
              demonstrating to this wider audience how advanced  methods of econometrics can
              be used to advantage to address real  problems.  The second function is to
              improve the theory of  econometrics by communicating to theorists what is
              working out in  practice, what is not, and what needs to be done.  These two 
              conferences are a very important step in achieving these goals.  Issues of
              judgment and interpretation always characterize  empirical research, and it is
              essential to have a dialogue that  will improve the quality of the papers in
              the published volume,  and that will allow dissenting views both at the
              conference and  in the published volume.
