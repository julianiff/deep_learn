              Campus    Academic Research Infrastructure:  Development of Automatic Test
              Station for Network Synchronization Performance Characterization    This
              Academic Research Infrastructure award supports the development of an automatic
              test station for synchronization characterization of telecommunications
              networks.    The research projects supported by the award include:    1. The
              development of the test station.    2. Development of software for the
              generation of test signals and for the user interface.    3. Research on better
              synchronization in synchronous optical networks.
