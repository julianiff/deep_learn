Abstract    :
              9601929  Anbar    This grant, made through the Academic Research  Infrastructure
              (ARI) Program, provides $294,772 as  partial support of the costs of acquiring
              a high-  resolution inductively coupled plasma mass  spectrometer (HR-ICP-MS)
              with a laser ablation  microprobe capable of making rapid and precise 
              determinations of trace element concentrations and  isotopic ratios in both
              aqueous and solid samples  with very low detection limits (parts per trillion 
              or better) for studies in environmental  geochemistry, biochemistry and
              toxicology at the  University of Rochester.  Specific studies to be  undertaken
              with the capabilities of this state-of-  the-art instrument will include
              analyses of the  distribution of trace metals (i.e. Fe, Mn, V and  Re) in
              sediments as indicators of paleoredox  conditions, analyses of isotopic ratios
              in  biological samples for use as tracers of the  kinetics of trace metal
              uptake, analyses of trace  element distributions in black shales and mid- 
              ocean ridge basalts as diagenetic and petrogenetic  indicators, analyses of the
              distribution of ultra-  trace elements (i.e. Ir) in natural waters and  studies
              of the mobility of toxic trace elements in  groundwaters.  ***
