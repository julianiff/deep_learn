Abstract    :
              9601037  Jaworski   A meeting will be held to discuss the biochemical and
              metabolic aspects of 3-ketocyl synthases.  These moieties are significant in
              several essential metabolic pathways in plants, animals, and bacteria.  This is
              a unique opportunity for these researchers to get together and share their
              ideas.  Participation of students and postdoctoral fellows will be emphasized.
