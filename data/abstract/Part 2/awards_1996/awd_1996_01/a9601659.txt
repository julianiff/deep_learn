Abstract    :
                      Six ABI automated Model 377 DNA Sequencers are requested by  the 
              Consortium  formed  among the Stanford  Genome  Center  (Ron  Davis)/the  
              University   of  Pennsylvania   (Joe   Ecker)/   and  PGEC/USDA-UCBerkeley (A.
              Theologis) for sequencing 15 Mb  of  DNA  of the Arabidopsis genome. The
              consortium has proposed to the NSF  that  it  will  be  able to achieve this
              goal  with  its  current  capacity  in  DNA  sequencers within three years  at 
              a  cost  of  $0.67/base. The acquisition of additional DNA sequencers (two  by 
              each   participating  site)  is  justifiable  for  the  following  reasons:    
              1.  It will allow the completion of the project in two instead     of three
              years and at the same cost per base.     2.  New  instrumentation is being
              developed  at  the  Stanford     Genome  Center  which  will produce DNA 
              sequencing  reactions     more  rapidly and at lower cost. Consequently, the 
              additional     DNA   sequencers  will  be  necessary  to  utilize  this   new  
                technology  to full capacity in achieving higher DNA  sequence    
              production.     3.  Our proposal to complete 15 Mb of DNA sequencing in  three 
                 years  is  based  on the assumption that ABI  will  honor  its    
              commitment  to  release  the  upgrade  of  the  373  and   377     sequencers  
              to  64  lanes/gel  by  spring,  1996.   If   this     commitment  is  not 
              honored, additional  sequencers  will  be     required for completing the 15 Mb
              DNA sequencing project.    The  establishment of a Consortium for sequencing
              the Arabidopsis  genome will provide a national example of transferring
              technology  from  a major Center (Stanford) to other universities. This  will 
              allow the training of young scientists (Ph.D. students, postdocs)  for future
              genomic research.
