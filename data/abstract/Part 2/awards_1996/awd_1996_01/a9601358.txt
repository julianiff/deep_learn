Abstract    :
              9601358  Thommes    The symposium will address problems in developmental
              endocrinology from an integrative standpoint.  Its aim is to evaluate the
              current state of the art, and to identify important future directions in
              research and utilization of non-mammalian vertebrates.  The expected data will
              serve as the basis for a wide range of applied aspects, from lamprey (pest)
              control to new approaches to fish farming and improved poultry (egg and meat)
              production.  The one-day program is scheduled as part of the December 1996
              meeting of the Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology (formerly the
              American Society of Zoologists).  Its format is oriented to create strong
              interactions (discussions) between the presenters and the general audience,
              resulting in a more "fruitful event" than the traditional lecture-only format.
