Abstract    :
                    9601796  Lucht  This project is an equipment award describing
              instrumentation to  be acquired.  It should be emphasized that, while the below
              is a  simple listing of the equipment, installation will result in a  fully
              integrated system aimed at fulfilling the project  objective.  The
              instrumentation will fill voids in the new Fire  Science Laboratory, enabling a
              more robust range of data to  support fire model development and validation. 
              Use of this  equipment is described in the previous section of this proposal.  
               Equipment is:         o    The NBS Smoke Chamber manufactured by Superpressure
               Inc. will be up-dated to attain current ISO 5659 and ASTM E662  protocol.     
                 o    Conical Radiator Furnace (CRF), and Data Acquisition  System.         o
                 Oxygen Analyzer         o    Automated Infrared Imaging System         o   
              Suppression Agents         o    Phase Doopler Particle Analyzer  ***
