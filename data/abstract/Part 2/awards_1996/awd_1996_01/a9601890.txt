Abstract    :
              ***  9601890  Rudolph  This grant will provide partial support for the
              development  of a short pulse (2 psec), high power (10 TW) laser facility  at
              the University of New Mexico.  This facility will be at  the edge of current
              technology, and will support a broad  experimental program in atomic and
              optical physics,  condensed matter physics, and biological imaging.  ***
