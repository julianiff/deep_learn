Abstract    :
              U. of Colorado, Denver   The research focuses upon 19th century
              industrialization and regional development in the United States.  The primary
              objective is to determine the character and extent of rural-urban linkages and
              to document the mutual construction of city and countryside in two regional
              settings: eastern Iowa and northern Colorado.  The research aims to trace the
              articulation of extraction and manufacturing within regional economies,
              highlight the centrality of resource-based industrialization to American
              economic growth and connect rural social and environmental change directly to
              the process of urban expansion.  A comparative regional approach will be used
              to examine the development of rural -urban linkages.  In addition a production
              based approach will be used to examine the formation and restructuring of
              commodity-specific chains of production, distribution and consumption that
              weave rural and urban space into a single territory.  Data will be gathered
              from archival sources in both locales.  The project will provide new knowledge
              and add to our theoretical understanding of the process of regional development
              and its urban and rural bases.
