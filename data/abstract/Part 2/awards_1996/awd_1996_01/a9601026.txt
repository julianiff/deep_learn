Abstract    :
              The Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Texas  insures that
              important algal stocks with which research in  the past and the present has
              been concerned are preserved  for future workers.  The Collection serves as a
              center from  which stocks of algae of known quality can be obtained by 
              investigators in all disciplines without restriction as to  their use.  The
              Collection is the only major, general  purpose collection of algae in the
              United States.  Cultures  are distributed to the scientific community in the
              United  States and to many foreign countries.
