Abstract    :
              INT 9601389  Parr      This U.S.-Hungary project between Dr. Robert Parr of the
              University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and Dr. Agnes Nagy of Lajos Kossuth
              University, Debrecen, will address density functional theory.  The researchers
              intend to extend current understanding of kinetic, exchange, and correlation
              density functionals as well as explore the use, within the theory, of the
              concept of local temperature.  To do so, the researchers will focus their
              collaborative work on defining the following: 1) new exact relations for
              electron density and energy density functionals that provide criteria to be
              fulfilled by approximate methods; 2) methods to determine exchange, correlation
              and Pauli potentials in electron density; 3) extensions of density functional
              theory to excited states; and 4) thermodynamic interpretations of the theory. 
              Results are expected to be useful in basic research related to molecular
              electronic structure.    This project in theoretical and computational
              chemistry fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
              enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
              complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of mutual interest
              and competence.   ??
