Abstract    :
              This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI)  Program will  
              assist the School of Chemical Sciences at the University of Illionois at  
              Urbana-Champaign upgrade the existing 500 MHz NMR spectrometer.  This  
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the   following:
              (1)  solid state structural studies of proteins and inorganic   systems (2)  
              structural studies of biologically active natural products   (3) structural
              studies of the estrogen receptor (4) structural studies of  
              protein-carbohydrate interactions (5) structures and dynamics of nucleic   acid
              complexes (6)  high resolution NMR studies of chemical and   biochemical
              systems at high pressure and (7)  sol-gel processing of   advanced ceramic
              materials (8)  nanoporous coordination networks (9)    donor solvent-assisted
              synthesis of inorganic materials (10)  size   effects in dielectric and
              electrooptic ceramic oxides (11)    characterization of electrochemically
              modified surfaces, and (12)    nanporous extended networks based on
              supramolecular bonding   Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the
              most powerful tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure
              of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize
              specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
                interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research.
              The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers,
              catalysis, and in biology
