Abstract    :
                   SBR-9601540       LEAVITT    The purpose of this project is to complete and
              prepare for  publication a bilingual dictionary of Passamaquoddy-Maliseet and 
              English, including complete verb and noun paradigms, a brief  grammatical
              sketch of the language in lay terms, a pronunciation  guide, and audio clips. 
              No other comprehensive dictionary of the  language exists or is in production. 
                The Passamaquoddy-Maliseet language has about 2,000 speakers in  Maine and
              adjacent New Brunswick, and elsewhere, but only about  400-500 fluent speakers.
              Practically all fluent speakers are 50  years of age or older. Numerous younger
              people, however, are  learning the language or wish to perfect their speaking
              skills.  Many educational programs and groups of people in the region are 
              natural centers around which this project will organize  activities to develop
              the dictionary.
