              Academic Research Infrastructure: Development of a Wide Area Scaleable
              Infrastructure for Data Intensive Computing: Consortium Proposal    This
              Academic Research Infrastructure award supports the acquisition of equipment to
              enhance the National Scaleable Cluster Project.  The equipment will be sited at
              3 universities to further the development of a national meta computing center. 
              The equipment consists of large fast disk arrays, high performance computer
              cluster enhancements, ATM network switches to OC-12 capabilities, network
              connections, and associated software.    The research projects supported by the
              equipment include:    1.  Applications computing that is data intensive
              including data mining of particle physics data, digital library development of
              the linguistics data consortium, digital library development of astrophysics,
              gravitational lenses data maps, galactic large structure simulations, and the
              development of numerical and statistical digital libraries.    2. Real time
              computing applications including collecting reduced astronomical data, medical
              imaging, and telepresence.    3. Parallel compute intensive applications
              including liquid crystal imaging, phase transition simulations, crystal surface
              computational studies, and vortex flow studies.    4. High speed network
              research including network striping and the inclusion of tertiary store in high
              performance memory hierarchies.    5. Computer science research on scaleable
              object stores, research on caching, transforming, and replicating data, and
              software tools for cluster management.
