Abstract    :
              9601420  Farell    This Americas Program award will support a collaborative 
              research project between Dr. Cesar Farell, University of  Minnesota, and Dr.
              Rafael Guarga, Instituto de Mecanica de  los Fluidos e Ingenieria Ambiental,
              Universidad de la  Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay (IMFIA).  The objective is to
               carry out comparative studies of the performance of two  boundary layer wind
              tunnels, one in Montevideo, under the  direction of IMFIA and the other at the
              St. Anthony Falls  Laboratory (SAFL), Minnesota.  The proposed program will 
              provide prototype performance data for several of the tunnel  components. 
              Simulations of atmospheric boundary layers in  both tunnels would be compared,
              with attention to the  effects of turbulence and its scales on the mean and 
              fluctuating pressures on building models.    Considerable advances have been
              made in ongoing research to  investigate critical issues in the modeling of
              atmospheric  boundary layers, but there are many aspects of the  techniques
              that still require investigation.  Results of  this research, which complements
              earlier NSF funded work  related to the design and evaluation of the SAFL
              tunnel,  would make a contribution toward a better understanding of  the flow
              dynamics and the identification of essential  modeling requirements.  The
              benefit to the U.S. research  effort will be in added manpower, and broadened
              scope of  work to include different component geometries and scales,  and the
              opportunity to advance the international exchange of  scientific knowledge.
