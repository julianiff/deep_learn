Abstract    :
              9601668  Sherrell  Funds  are  provided  to Rutgers University for acquisition 
              of an Isotope Ratio Mass  Spectrometer (IRMS) and  an  Inductively-Coupled
              Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) which  will be utilized  for integrated and
              interdisciplinary  studies of coastal biogeochemistry.  The IRMS will allow the
               determination of  stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen,  sulfur, and
              oxygen in samples of  sea water, particulate  organic matter, and plant and
              animal tissue. The ICP-MS will  permit rapid sensitive analysis of a suite of
              elements which  act as important tracers of pathways  within biogeochemical 
              cycles in the marine environment.  Both mass spectrometers  will be managed by
              faculty working groups in user groups,  and the instruments will be run on a
              cost per sample basis.  Rutgers University is supporting this project with
              $316,000,  which represents a 44% costshare.  ***
