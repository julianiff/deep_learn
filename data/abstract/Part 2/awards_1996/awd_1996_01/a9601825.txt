Abstract    :
              9601825  Tsui    A superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) 
              magnetometer will be acquired by the University of North Carolina  at Chapel
              Hill. The magnetometer will be used to study the static  and dynamic response
              of metallic and oxide thin films and  superlattices. Four types of materials
              will be studies: metallic  thin films and superlattices, high temperature
              superconducting  films, thin films of metallic glasses, and nanostructures made
              by  scanning probe microscopy techniques. The SQUID will be used to 
              investigate magnetic phases, magnetic coupling and  magnetotransport  in
              metallic superlattices, effects of oxygen  content in high temperature
              superconductors, electronic states  and ordering in metallic glasses, and spin
              fluctuations and  electron-electron interactions in nanostructures.  %%%  This
              research will help to elucidate the role of morphology and  dimensionality on
              the material properties and to understand the  nature of the magnetic and
              electronic interactions in these  materials. Placement of the SQUID
              magnetometer in the Research  Triangle Park area will enhance the local
              research  infrastructure.  ***
