                                        ABSTRACT                           AST-9601507        
                               T. L. Hayward                                                 
                              A dual camera system is to be developed for the Hale 200  inch
              telescope at Palomar Observatory.  The first camera  will be used with an
              adaptive optics (AO) system currently  being built for Palomar by the Jet
              Propulsion Laboratory.  The AO system will correct the effects of astronomical 
              seeing to achieve an angular resolution near the telescope's  diffraction limit
              of 0.1 arcsecond at a wavelength of 2.2  micrometers.  The second camera will
              provide a complementary  wide-field (4 arcminute) imaging capability.  Both
              cameras  will be built using 1024 x 1024 pixel HgCdTe array  detectors, the
              largest devices for the 1 to 2.5 micrometer  wavelength region available today.
