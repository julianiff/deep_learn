Abstract    :
              9601516  Rodgers  Bowling Green University  This award from the Academic
              Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry
              at Bowling Green University acquire a laser system. This equipment will enhance
              research in a number of areas including the following: (1)  excited state
              dynamics of metalloporphyrins and related macrocycles (2)  photoinduced charge
              transfer between chromophores and colloidal semiconductors  (3)  ultrafast
              intramolecular electron transfer reactions in ion-pair systems containing
              (alkyl)n(phenyl)4-n borate anions (4)  adaptation of photosynthetic prokaryote
              to changes in environmental light conditions, and (5)  solvational control of
              negative activation energies for emission decay.      A laser can provide
              important information about chemical reactivity.  Its use may enable
              breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties of reactivity and
              nonreactivity of molecules.
