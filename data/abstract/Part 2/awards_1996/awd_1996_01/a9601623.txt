Abstract    :
              CTS - 9601623  Arup L. Sengupta  Lehigh University    ABSTRACT      The grant
              will allow the purchase of several instruments including atomic absorption
              spectrophotometer, capillary electrophoresis chromatograph, mercury porosimeter
              with surface analyzer, epiflourescene microscope and thermometric calorimeter. 
              The on going research activities in environmental, geo-environmental and
              contaminant hydrology areas at Lehigh University will greatly benefit from the
              acquisition of the instruments.  Specifically, these instruments will help
              accomplish the following two objectives:  first, to characterize the key
              physical and chemical properties of a wide range of particulate matters
              including soils, natural and synthetic sorbents, metal precipitates, sludges
              and microorganisms; and second, to analyze trace concentrations of
              environmentally important chemicals, namely, heavy metals, organic solvents,
              dissolved cations and anions, pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. 
              Also, increased opportunities for inter-disciplinary research are likely to
              follow.    ***
