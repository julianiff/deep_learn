Abstract    :
              9601919  Kak    This award supports the participation of 20 senior U.S. 
              graduate students in a U.S.-Japan Graduate Student Forum  entitled "Robotics of
              Today and Tomorrow for Advanced  Automation and Other Societal Applications" to
              be held at  Senri Life Science Center, Osaka, Japan, November 8 and 9,  1996. 
              The co-organizers are Professor Avi Kak of Purdue  University and Professor
              Yoshiaki Shirai of Osaka  University.  An equal number of superior graduate
              students  will be selected from the Japanese universities;  participation of
              the Japanese students will be supported by  separate funds raised in Japan. 
              The specific aims of the  Forum are to: (1) foster collaborative links between
              the  promising graduate students -- the future leaders in  research and
              development -- in robotics and automation in  the two countries; (2) review the
              current state-of-the-art  in robotics and automation; (3) discuss the
              disparities that  exist between the experiments that can be carried out in the 
              best university laboratories and the somewhat lagging state-  of-the-art of the
              best robotic practices in industry in the  two countries; (4) discuss future
              directions for research  and development and how projects carried out jointly
              between  the two countries can help  with the realization of the future.  ***
