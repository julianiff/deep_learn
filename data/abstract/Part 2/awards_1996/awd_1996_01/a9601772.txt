Abstract    :
              9601772  Kastner    A high-performance transmission electron microscope will be 
              acquired by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The  instrument will be
              part of the Shared Experimental Facility  (SEF) of the Center for Materials
              Science and Engineering at MIT.  The SEF serves a large research community both
              inside and outside  MIT. The instrument will provide several capabilities
              required  for current research that are not currently available, including 
              convergent beam electron diffraction with good simultaneous  microanalytical
              capabilities, and low dose and cryo-microscopy.  Major research projects that
              will use the new electron microscope  include: the study of nanostructured
              polymers, synthesis and  characterization of ultrafine conducting oxides,
              oxidation and  sulfidation of metals and alloys, characterization of 
              superconducting oxide films, and design of GeSi superlattice  detectors.  %%% 
              The new electron microscope will benefit not only researchers at  MIT but also
              at other universities and industries in the Greater  Boston area. The
              instrument will also be used in undergraduate  and graduate courses, and in
              MITOs outreach program for minority  students from local schools. It will thus
              allow for research  training of future scientists and engineers from diverse 
              backgrounds in current techniques of electron microscopy and  state-of-the-art
              instrumentation.  ***
