Abstract    :
              ***  9601586  Fortson  This grant will expand the existing Laser Facility 
              operations at the University of Washington Physics  Department, to develop
              spectrally pure laser sources in more  difficult spectral regions: the
              ultraviolet between 190 nm  and 250 nm, and the middle infrared beyond 1.5 m. 
              The UV  will be served by efficient frequency quadrupling of diode  and YAG
              lasers and mixing of the latter with existing Ti-  Sapphire lasers, and the IR
              will depend upon the  exploitation of color center lasers and of new
              technologies,  such as thulium-doped microchip systems and fiber lasers.  A 
              link with the Department of Chemistry laser based research  will be
              established.  ***
