Abstract    :
              The victory of the nationalists in the 1993 Russian parliamentary elections
              followed by the victory of the communists in the 1995 parliamentary elections
              raises questions about the nature of public support for apparently undemocratic
              political organizations during periods of democratic transition.  This project
              seeks to understand the bases for support for communist and nationalist
              political parties in contemporary Russia.  In order to do so, this project will
              continue a series of surveys gauging the state of the Russian democratic
              experiment by examining the attitudes and behaviors of the Russian electorate
              during the Presidential campaign in summer 1996.  Examination of the current
              campaign and the nature of Presidential politics will facilitate understanding
              of the consolidation of democracy in Russia or identify its tenuous attraction
              to the Russian public.  Face-to-face interviews will be conducted with 4000
              respondents in a stratified national probability sample.  The survey will be
              conducted by leading scholars at Moscow University and the Russian Academy of
              Sciences.  Data from the 1993-1996 surveys will be archived to permit secondary
              analysis of these important data.
