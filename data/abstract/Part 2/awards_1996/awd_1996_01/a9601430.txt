Abstract    :
              9601430  Gilboy  This study explores a recent dramatic change in U.S. efforts to
              combat clandestine immigration through the regulation of international
              airlines. In the past, airlines operated under a stringent liability system in
              which regardless of the thoroughness of their screening they were subject to
              stiff sanctions if they transported an inadequately documented traveler. In
              October 1994, however, these screening laws were significantly relaxed.      In
              exploring this recent policy change the study has two objectives. First, it
              examines the debate between international airlines and the U.S. Immigration
              Service over airline responsibility for illegal travelers. The research
              describes and analyzes the differing perspectives about airline responsibility
              for illegal travelers such as asylum seekers who board planes with forged
              documents, destroy them on route, and then claim asylum once they have arrived.
               Second, it explores the sources of the recent legislative change, focusing on
              the context in which the legislative policy shift occurred. The study examines
              several explanations (economic concerns, political interests, transnational
              forces, ideas about deregulation and private enforcement) for the congressional
              decision to change the century old approach to carrier regulation. Canada,
              where relaxation of stringent laws also occurred recently, will provide a
              useful additional case to begin to refine and elaborate the model.      This
              analysis of clandestine immigration and its control through the use of
              international airlines will contribute to our understanding of the fundamental
              issue of public and private domains and the role of law in their articulation.
