              Academic Research Infrastructure: Development of a Distributed High-Performance
              Computing Environment for Research in Science and Engineering    This Academic
              Research Infrastructure award supports the acquisition of a high speed network
              and high speed computational workstations to build a high performance
              distributed computing environment.    The research projects supported by the
              equipment include:    1. Development of distributed parallel processing
              techniques for scientific computations.    2. Application of distributed
              parallel computing to support research in the areas of material processing,
              multiscale failure analysis, and multiphase flows.    3. Development and
              application of virtual reality techniques to investigate the results of large
              scale simulations and to interactively steer the simulations.    4. Research ,
              development, and evaluation of student mobile computing for delivery of
              anywhere, anytime instruction.    5. Research and development in advanced
              networking, and the development of an ATM-based network to support all facets
              of this program.
