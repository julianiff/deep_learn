Abstract    :
              9601640  Mao    Thin film characterization instruments will be acquired by the 
              Colorado School of Mines to complement existing thin film  deposition
              facilities. The new instrumentation includes an  ultraviolet-visible-near
              infrared spectrophotometer, a computer-  controlled surface profilometer, an
              ellipsometer, and a Hall  effect and thermopower measurement station. These
              instruments  will support studies on polycrystalline compound semiconductor 
              thin films for photovoltaic solar cells, transparent conductive  oxide thin
              films, thin metal oxide barriers on photoconducting  films for
              electrophotography applications, polymeric thin films,  metallic oxide
              catalysts, and electrogalvanized sheet steels.  %%%  The new instruments will
              strengthen the thin films and coatings  research efforts at the university. The
              research involves the  participation of students and faculty from several
              departments  through an interdisciplinary materials science program, and 
              capitalizes on collaborations with the National Renewable Energy  Laboratory.
              The new instrumentation will also benefit a new  masters degree program that is
              oriented towards the  microelectronics industry.  ***
