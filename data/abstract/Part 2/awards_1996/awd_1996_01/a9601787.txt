              Academic Research Infrastructure:  Acquisition of Instrumentation to Provide
              Scientific and Data Visualization Capability at Clark Atlanta University   
              This Academic Research Infrastructure award supports the acquisition of a high
              end visualization computer.    The research projects supported by this
              instrumentation include:    1. Research in the Geographic Information Systems
              laboratory including health risk assessment, GIS DB improvement, and 3-D
              Virtual GIS.    2. Research on the synergy of Design, Simulation, and
              Visualization in Engineering.
