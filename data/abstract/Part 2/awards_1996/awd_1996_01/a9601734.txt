Abstract    :
              9601734  Pan    A  mode-locked titanium-doped sapphire laser system will be 
              acquired by Fisk University. The pulsed laser system will serve  as excitation
              source for characterizing two basic type of laser  and nonlinear optical
              materials: doped glasses and II-VI compound  semiconductors. Phenomena to be
              studied include luminescence  lifetimes of rare-earth ions in glasses,
              nonlinear optical  indexes of quantum-dot glasses, and the nonlinear optical 
              response of and optical limiting in doped glasses and II-VI  semiconductors.
              The phenomena to be studied are relevant to the  utilization of the materials
              in nonlinear optical devices. The  research program involves undergraduate and
              masterOs degree  students.  %%%  The proposed laser system is a major and
              essential  equipment for  the research on nonlinear optical materials at Fisk
              University.  The outcome of such research has important potential applications 
              to all optical switching and to high data rate communications.  The
              instrumentation will strengthen and complement the existing  capabilities for
              characterization of optical and electronic  materials. The UniversityOs
              teaching program will be enhanced  since underrepresented minority students
              will gain experience in  using lasers and various optical techniques.  ***
