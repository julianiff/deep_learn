               Academic Research Infrastructure:  Acquisition of Instrumentation for Testing
              of Ultra-Wideband Wireless and Wired Communications and Design of Enabling
              Instruments    This Academic Research Infrastructure award supports the
              acquisition of very high speed analysis and test equipment for research on high
              speed communication networks.    The research projects supported by the
              equipment are:    1. The design and implementation of ultra-wideband wireless
              and wired computer network systems.    2. An experimental research project on
              the design of an impulse radio wireless network for Ghz bandwidth base
              stations.    3. A research program in ultra high-speed circuit and test
              fixturing.
