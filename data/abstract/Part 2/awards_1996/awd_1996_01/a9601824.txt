Abstract    :
              This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will   assist
              the Department of Chemistry at Yale University acquire a laser   system. This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas   including the following:
              (1)  time-resolved two-photon photoelectron and   photofragmentation
              spectroscopies of mass selected negative ions (2)    liquid dynamics and
              solvation probed with fs THz pulse spectroscopy (3)    non-linear spectroscopy
              of microdroplets, and (4) nonlinear spectroscopic   probes of photo-induced
              molecular dynamics and the optical properties of   novel materials.  A tunable
              laser can provide important information about chemical   reactivity.  Its use
              may enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the   properties of reactive
              and nonreactive molecules.
