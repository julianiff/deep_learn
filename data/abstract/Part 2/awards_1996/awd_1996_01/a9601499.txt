Abstract    :
              9601499  Chowdhuri         The Center for Electric Power at the Tennessee
              Technological  University (TTU) all purchase (i) three 750-MHz opto-electronic 
              voltage probes, and three optical transmission lines, including  ancillary
              equipment and (ii) a 4-channel, 500-MHz digital oscilloscope with peripheral
              equipment.  The equipment will be used to measure very fast voltage transients
              for research on electromagnetic transients in power systems . This equipment
              will be of immediate benefit to two projects:       1.   Breakdown Mechanisms
              of Air Gaps under Lightning    Voltages; and       2.   Laboratory Simulation
              of Lightning Stroke Channel.     In addition, the proposed equipment could also
              be used in a third project, "Effects of Transient Voltages on Power
              Semiconductor Devices".       The ongoing projects at the Center for Electric
              Power  require simultaneous measurement of several very fast transient 
              phenomena.  The proposed equipment will make it possible to  perform these
              measurements without electromagnetic interferences. An understanding of the
              breakdown mechanisms of air gaps will result in reliable and cost effective
              insulation coordination of the electric power systems.  A successful laboratory
              simulation of the lightning stroke channel will be a powerful tool to verify
              theories on the response of power systems to lightning strokes, thus minimizing
              the need for time consuming and uncertain field tests.  ***   ??
