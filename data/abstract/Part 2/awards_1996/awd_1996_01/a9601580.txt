              Research Infrastructure: The Purchase of a Scaleable Parallel Computer to
              Complete the High End Computing Infrastructure    This Academic Research
              Infrastructure award supports the acquisition of a high speed SMD computing
              systems operating at a peak speed of approximately 15 GFLops.    The research
              projects supported by the equipment include:    1. Astrophysics research in
              simulation of cosmic ray cascades.    2. Numerical simulations of strong
              nuclear interactions.    3. Molecular structure simulations.    4. Quantum
              chemistry.    5. Applied seismology.    6. Advanced materials including
              nanostructures and electronic properties of solids.    7. Atmospheric physics.
