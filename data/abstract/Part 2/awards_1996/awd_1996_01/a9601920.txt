Abstract    :
              Scheinkman  9601920    The high degree of variance of crime rates across space
              and across time is one of the oldest puzzles in the social sciences.   Under
              his previous NSF grant the investigator demonstrated that the variation of
              crime rates across U.S. cities with a population of at least 25,000, is too
              large to be explained by independent decisions across agents, even after
              considering a series of urban characteristics.  A model is developed where
              social interactions create enough covariance across individuals to explain the
              high cross-city variance of crime rates.  This model provides a natural index
              of social interactions which can compare the degree of social interaction
              across crimes, across geographic units and across time.  This empirical
              framework allows the decomposition of the gap between actual crime rates and
              the crime rates predicted using observable characteristics, into a portion due
              to omitted city characteristics, and a portion due to social interactions.  The
              empirical estimates of the index of social interactions gives similar results
              for different data samples, and suggests that the amount of social interactions
              are highest in petty crimes (such as larceny and auto theft), moderate in more
              serious crimes (assault, burglary and robbery) and almost negligible in murder
              and rape.  Part of the work continues research on understanding and measuring
              the role of social interactions in the determination of crime rates.   The
              index of social interactions is also applied to non-criminal choices such as
              teenage pregnancies and schooling choice.  The proposal also deals with dynamic
              models of social interaction with an aim to modeling and measuring the role of
              social interactions in the determination of the behavior of migration over time
              and in the distribution of migration across communities.
