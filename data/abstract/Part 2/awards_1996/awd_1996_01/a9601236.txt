Abstract    :
              This award provides stipends and other supporting services for scholars in
              one-year residence as Fellows of the Center for Advanced Study in the
              Behavioral Sciences, Stanford, California.  The objective of the project is to
              foster the advancement of knowledge generated by scholars conducting basic
              research in the behavioral sciences.  The Center's structure and procedures
              provide an environment that is conducive to scholarly productivity as well as
              interdisciplinary exchange and collaboration.  Fellows are chosen on the basis
              of their academic accomplishment and promise.  The research they conduct at the
              Center is of their own choice and design.  The Center organizes seminars,
              encourages the formation of informal groups, and plans common meals, all
              designed to promote intellectual interaction among Fellows.  The Center's
              environment is designed to promote full-time research, and to minimize
              distractions from and interruptions to productive scientific work.
