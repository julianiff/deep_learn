Abstract    :
              9601698  Quay       The PI requests funds for the purchase of a new Gas 
              Chromarograph-Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (GC-IRMS).  The PI presents three
              major reasons to support this request:  1) A GC0IRMS instrument, which uses a
              new technology  coupling a continuous flow gas chromatograph with a 
              traditional IRMS, and allows isotopic analysis on samples  that are a 1000x
              times smaller in size than the minimum  sample size required for their
              traditional static inlet; 2)  currently their sample output for isotope ratio
              measurements  is limited by available analysis time of their mass 
              spectrometer; 3) and the requested GC-IRMS and two automated  sample
              preparation devices will significantly reduce the  technician time required for
              isotope ration measurements.  The University of Washington is offering $234,950
              of  matching funds which represents a 49.7% cost share.  ***
