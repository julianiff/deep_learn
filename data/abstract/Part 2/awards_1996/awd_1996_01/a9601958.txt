Abstract    :
              9601958  Bernard  This Academic Research Infrastructure Award provides funds for
              a Silicon Graphics Inc. Power Challenge with 16 MIPS R10000 processors with 2
              Gigabytes of 8-way interleaved RAM, a 4-node HiPPI network switch, and a 21.3
              Gigabyte RAID disk. This high performance computing engine will be integrated
              with existing immersive environments and dedicated to the support of
              numerically demanding real-time simulations controlled from synthetic
              environments for engineering problem solving.     The equipment provided by
              this grant will make possible the development of an integrated environment with
              computational and immersive visualization capabilities to support research in
              intelligence amplification for engineering. Intelligence amplification enables
              engineers to immerse themselves in the problem or phenomena under study using
              haptic, visual and audio cues to support real-time communications between the
              user of the   environment and the numerical simulations. This will be a
              paradigm shift for engineering design and manufacturing. Engineers will be able
              to cost-effectively perform "what if" studies while obtaining immediate
              feedback. This environment also will have a significant impact on the engineers
              of the next century by providing graduate and undergraduate students of today
              with a unique research environment that will prepare them for leadership
              positions in a variety of careers involving the application   of these new
              technologies.  ***
