Abstract    :
              9601571  Henyey    This award provides partial funding (59% of total cost) for
              the  acquisition of Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and  ancillary
              equipment for installing 50 GPS stations of the Southern  California Integrated
              GPS Network (SCIGN).  Installation,  operation, and maintenance of the stations
              will be coordinated by  the University of Southern California.  The institution
              is  committed to providing the remaining 41% of cost of this project.   
              Geodetic techniques to measure crustal deformation have seen rapid  advances
              recently.  State-of-the-art GPS techniques are currently  capable of measuring
              displacements of a few millimeters.  The  continuously operating SCIGN network
              in the Los Angeles area will  be able to detect rates approaching 1 mm/yr and
              will be used to map  the regional strain pattern as it develops overtime in
              this  earthquake prone area.  ***
