Abstract    :
              9601603  Shapiro, Steven S.  Whitnell, Robert M.  Guilford College    Academic
              Research Infrastructure: Acquisition of computation and visualization tools for
              disciplinary and interdisciplinary research training of undergraduates in
              astronomy, chemistry, geology and physics.    This Academic Research
              Infrastructure award supports the acquisition of computation and visualization
              workstations.  The workstations are to be used for faculty and undergraduate
              research in computational science.    The research projects supported by the
              equipment include projects on astronomy and chemistry using spectral studies of
              galactic clouds; geology and physics using predictive techniques to determine
              mantle viscosity from rebound effects of the glacial age - this research also
              will involve GIS access and use;  interdisciplinary research involving novel
              uses of computational visualization.
