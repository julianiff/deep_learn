Abstract    :
              Among the central concerns of this project are such questions as: How is
              feminine technology  distinctive?  What do these distinctions tell us about
              technology and about women?  How have  Americans' cultural perceptions of
              gender differences shaped and been shaped by technological  change?  To explore
              such questions this project will examine seven `feminine` technologies, 
              meaning technologies associated with women either by virtue of biological
              difference or by  virtue of sex role prescription (especially through the
              division of labor).  Unlike other studies of  women and technology that focus
              on exceptional women using technologies that are  predominantly masculine in
              character, this project will ask what sorts of technological  knowledge common
              American women have historically possessed, how they have used that  knowledge,
              and why women's technological knowledge has been largely undervalued.
