Abstract    :
              9601006  Krimm  A new and systematic method has been developed for  optimizing
              potential energy functions for molecular  mechanics (MM) and molecular dynamics
              (MD) studies of  macromolecules.  By analytically transforming scaled ab 
              initio force fields of conformers of model systems, an MM  function is obtained
              that reproduces the structures,  energies, and vibrational frequencies of the
              ab initio  calculation.  This is called a spectroscopically determined  force
              field (SDFF), and the approach has been successfully  implemented for saturated
              hydrocarbons.  This proposal will  develop an SDFF for the polypeptide chain of
              proteins, based  on analogous ab initio calculations of  conformers of 
              dipeptides.  In this process, an explicit hydrogen-bond  component of the
              energy function will be developed.  This  SDFF will be applied to MM, MD, and
              spectroscopic analyses  of proteins.  ***  The availability of more accurate 
              energy functions for  proteins will have a major impact on areas from
              structural  molecular biology to biotechnology.  The significance of  this
              development is that one will be able to predict  physical properties of
              proteins with much greater confidence  in their reliability than is possible at
              present.  This  means that knowledge will be advanced of how proteins  interact
              with each other and with other molecules, which is  the  basis for
              understanding a wide range of biological  processes.  %%%
