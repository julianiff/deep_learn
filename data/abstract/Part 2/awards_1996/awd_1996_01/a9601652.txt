Abstract    :
              This project will develop a field-deployable instrument system for
              characterizing lightning discharges in thunderstorms.  Different U.S. research
              sites have an increasing need for such an instrument, and the system would
              bring together several techniques which have successfully been used to study
              lightning and thunderstorms.  The system will determine the three-dimensional
              structure and development of lightning within a storm, both of individual
              lightning discharges and of the overall sequence of lightning activity.  This
              is to be done using (1) a time-of-arrival (TOA) system for locating the sources
              of radio frequency radiation from the lightning discharges, revealing the
              structure and development of the lightning channels, and (2) time-resolved
              electric field change measurements, indicating the amounts of charge transfer
              along the channels, and therefore the strength of the discharge.  Additional
              measurements of the atmospheric electrostatic field will characterize the
              overall electrical state of the parent thunderstorm.
