Abstract    :
              9601146  Leustek  The proposal focuses on the mechanisms of sulfate reduction in
              higher plants.  Specifically in the focus are the two rate-limiting enzymes of
              this pathway, APS-kinase and PAPS-reductase. Data submitted with the proposal
              indicated a major breakthrough on the biochemical reactions that govern sulfate
              reduction - indicating a paradigmatic change in how we have to view this
              metabolic reaction in plants.   The major goal of this proposal is to fortify
              the preliminary data by an in-depth biochemical study of the enzymatic
              reactions. Cloned genes are available, encoding the kinase (APK1) and reductase
              (APR1) enzymes. They will be used to synthesize proteins for biochemical
              investigations. A major part of the proposal is to over-express the enzymes
              and/ or to use antisense expression to reduce enzyme amounts in plants.  One
              aspect which may be highly significant is that APR1 is different from its
              bacterial counterpart in that it has a thioredoxin domain attached - possibly
              indicating that this enzyme is controlled by the redox state of the cell. This
              significant new aspect of sulfate metabolism will be analyzed.       Sulfate
              reduction is an important plant metabolism. The reactions provide reduced
              sulfur for a number of essential plant processes,  best known may be
              sulfur-containing essential amino acids. Effectively reducing sulfate to a less
              toxic form is also crucial to, for example, trees because sulfate is the major
              damaging component of acid rain.
