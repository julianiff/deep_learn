Abstract    :
                This award supports the travel of 12 Americans from academe and industry,
              including four advanced graduate students and/or postdoctoral researchers, to a
              U.S.-European workshop on crystal growth modeling to be held in Durbuy,
              Belgium, October 1996.  The co-organizers are Jeffrey J. Derby of the
              University of Minnesota and Francois Dupret of Catholic University of Louvain,
              Belgium.  Other participants include university- and industry-based scientists
              from Europe as well as Japan.  The objectives of the workshop are to identify
              common priorities, exchange new ideas and promote future collaborative work
              among the participants.  Their focus is the development and application of
              mathematical modeling to crystal growth.  The growth of crystalline materials
              ranges from the one-time creation of single-crystal protein pharmaceuticals to
              the annual production of metric tons of electronic-grade silicon for industrial
              use.  Successful growth of a variety of crystals of exacting quality for broad
              applications may be addressed through mathematical modeling.  This workshop
              will advance understanding of the use of mathematical modeling for the growth
              of a variety of crystals.
