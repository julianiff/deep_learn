Abstract    :
              Efforts to increase the number of women in science have met unexpected
              difficulties, despite  great efforts and good intentions.  Why this failure?  A
              varied array of literatures has offered  tentative answers to this question,
              but conceptual and institutional rifts between approaches have  made it
              difficult to assemble ideas and findings into a consistent explanation.  For
              example,  historical studies have examined the lives of women scientists within
              the contexts of institutions  that have held them at arm's length; sociological
              studies have uncovered women's limited access  to the means of scientific
              production; research in the life sciences has shown how science has  studied
              women; feminist theories of science have examined how gender shapes science and
               science education; and natural scientists themselves have shown how gender
              analysis has yielded  new research insights.  To date these rich and suggestive
              fields of study have not been drawn  together into dialog with one another. 
              The central purpose of this project is to develop  such a dialog, within the
              framework of a book, and to illustrate how foundational questions from  the
              areas of study interact with one another.
