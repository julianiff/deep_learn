Abstract    :
              9601833  Petty    A combined Doppler anemometer (PDA) and digital particle image
              velocimetry (PIV) system will be purchased with the dedicated HP workstations
              for supporting the ongoing basic and applied research of four faculty and their
              students.  The measurement facility would (1) enhance the professional
              interactions of MSU researchers with their national and international
              colleagues;  (2) provide new understanding of process equipment performance in
              terms of underlying flow phenomenon; and, (3) increase the knowledge base
              needed to validate multiphase flow models, turbulent closure theories, and
              rheological constitutive models for viscoelastic fluids.      The specific
              research problems proposed for study during the three-year acquisition period
              two-and three-dimensional involve the-phase flows, reverse flows, secondary
              flows, flow transitions, and unsteady flows.  Thus, the PDA/PIV system should
              yield new understanding of specific flow structures encountered in
              hydrocyclones, in automotive cooling fans, in piston/cylinder engines, and in
              reaction injection molding processes.  ***
