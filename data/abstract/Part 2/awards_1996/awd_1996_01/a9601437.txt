Abstract    :
               This is a study of the social construction of the American electricity
              industry.  It will explore the theory that several defining features of the
              industry were not inevitable, and were in fact heavily contested.  These
              include: l ) separation of the production of generating equipment from that of
              electricity; 2) the provision of electricity by central stations, over long
              distances, as opposed to small-scale ("isolated") generation in each home and
              business; 3) dominance of the industry by investor-owned rather than
              municipally-owned companies; 4) the integration of generation, transmission and
              distribution in single companies -- in effect, merging wholesale and retail
              provision of the product; and 5) the development of huge holding companies,
              integrating the provision of electricity by many smaller companies, over large
              geographic areas.  The research will apply quantitative techniques of analysis
              to unexpectedly rich data discovered by the investigators, such as
              comprehensive annual and even quarterly directories of all utility companies in
              North America, detailed proceedings of the two trade associations' meetings,
              and as well as numerous sources on the thousands of individuals who were
              decision-makers in this industry.  Among the planned analyses are: studies of
              the evolution of interlocking directorates over time, coordinated with studies
              of how the industry reached its highly concentrated form; analysis of the role
              of equipment suppliers, to examine how they became clearly separated from
              producers of electricity; investigation of how this industry became a duopoly
              (General Electric and Westinghouse); network analysis of individuals in the
              industry, through information provided in trade association proceedings and
              other biographical sources; study of the movement over time of individuals
              among organizations, and how this movement enhanced consensus in the industry
              and shaped social networks.  %%   The aim of this project is to use data on the
              development of one particular industry to devel op new ideas about the social
              construction of industry boundaries and goals, thus producing a fresh
              scientific perspective that can be applied to a wide range of contemporary
              industries.  The data are probably the most comprehensive available on the
              inception and development of any major industry, and the study will therefore
              make a valuable contribution to methods and theory in the sociology of
              industrial organization.  It will provide scientists and industrial leaders
              with an improved understanding of the ways that a new industry is shaped not
              only by  technological and economic constraints, but also by the mobilization
              of resources by concerned individuals, operating through their network of
              colleagues and competitors.
