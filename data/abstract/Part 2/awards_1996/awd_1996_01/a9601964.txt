Abstract    :
              Abstract  McKinnon  9601964    The PIs have requested an Academic Research
              Infrastructure (ARI) program support for the development of a molecular
              beam/mass spectrometer (MB/MS) system in order to obtain measurements on high
              temperature gas-phase processes so that detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms
              can be elucidated, and also to measure high resolution electronic spectra of
              unstable species created in these processes.  The instrument consists of a
              reactor section, an ionizer section, and a mass analyzer section.  The reactor
              section, where the high temperature species are generated, will make available
              a low pressure burner, a flow reactor, and a shock tube as sources of these
              species.  The ionizer will employ both electron impact ionization and
              photoionization techniques, while the mass analyzer will make use of both
              quadrupole and time of flight methods. This instrumentation will be used
              primarily in the elucidation of the mechanisms of aromatics oxidation and to
              provide input to carry out detailed chemical kinetic modeling (DCKM) of these
              oxidation processes.  ***
