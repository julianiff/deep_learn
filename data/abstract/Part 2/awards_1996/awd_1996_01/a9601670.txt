              Research Infrastructure: Development of Specialized Communications and Terminal
              Equipment for Research in Information Technology and Education Technology   
              This Academic Research Infrastructure award supports the acquisition of a
              networked human factors experimental facility.    The projects supported by
              this equipment include:    1. Multimodal human-computer dialogue.    2.
              Computer sensor instrumentation and their integration.    3. Accessibility to
              large multimodal databases by novel query methodologies.    4. Experimentation
              with various virtual environments in collaboration with psychologists and
              educational researchers.    5. Experimentation and development of software
              engineering environments to support human-computer interaction software
              development and usability assessment.
