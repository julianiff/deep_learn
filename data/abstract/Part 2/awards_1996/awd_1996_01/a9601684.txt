Abstract    :
                      9601684  Mahdavi  This project is for equipment at the Center for
              Building  Performance and Diagnostics (CBPD), NSF I/UCRC (Industry-  University
              Cooperative Research Center) at the Carnegie Mellon  University (CMU), for
              measurement instrumentation to enrich and  continue significant research in the
              building science and  engineering domain, such as energy consumption,
              environmental  sustainability, economic growth, worker productivity, and public
               health; involving research, education, and demonstration to make  a
              significant impact on the current approaches and practices both  in the
              building science as well as in the building industry.    The equipment will
              provide for: a weather station, thermal  diagnostics, acoustics, visual
              diagnostics, sensing and control  components. and utility distribution models.
