Abstract    :
              9601257  Smith       This grant provides partial support of an international 
              Workshop on Tau Lepton Physics (TAU96), the fourth in a  series on that
              subject. Previous conferences were held in  France in 1990, US in 1992 and
              Switzerland in 1994.  About  100 particle physicists attend.  Results are
              presented from  recent experiments at LEP at CERN, SLD at SLAC, BEPC in 
              Beijing, and especially to be noted, at CESR, the facility  at Cornell
              University supported by NSF.  ***
