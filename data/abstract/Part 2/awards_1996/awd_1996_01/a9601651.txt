Abstract    :
              9601651  Shiflet    Equipment for the synthesis and characterization of bulk 
              amorphous and nanocrystalline metal alloys will be acquired by  the University
              of Virginia. The instrumentation includes an  oscillator power supply for use
              in melt-spinning and induction  melting for metal alloys, a furnace for
              mechanical testing at  high temperatures, a microhardness tester, upgrades and 
              attachments to a scanning force microscope, and parts for  building a machine
              for making cluster-assembled materials.  Research activities that will use the
              requested equipment  encompass the synthesis and characterization of metallic
              glasses  and nanocrystalline materials, studies of size and shape effects  on
              the coalescence of small-scale precipitates, and morphology  and corrosion of
              metallic glass alloys.  %%%  The research fills a national need for both
              research and  educational activities in the important area of new bulk metallic
               glasses and nanocrystalline materials. The properties of these  new materials
              have sufficient potential that a considerable  investment has been made abroad
              for their study. It is important  that a strong effort be maintained in the US
              as well.  ***
