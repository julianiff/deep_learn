Abstract    :
                    9601778  Hung  This Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) award is made
              to  partially support the development of a new shearography  instrument for
              measuring time dependent deformations.  The  shearography technique allows
              full-field and noncontact  measurements.  The new aspect is to extend the
              technique to the  measurement of time dependent deformations.  This new
              capability  will be particularly useful for noncontact and full-field 
              measurements of structural vibrations and for nondestructive  testing of large
              structures such as bridges.  An  interdisciplinary team of researchers has been
              formed which  includes experts in optics, sensors, mechanics, control and 
              computer and image processing.  An interaction with industry is  also likely.
