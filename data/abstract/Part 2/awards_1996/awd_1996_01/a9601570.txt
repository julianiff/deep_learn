Abstract    :
              9601570  Raad  The goal of the effort is to enable electronic designers to
              simulate thermal effects concurrently with electrical effects in the rapidly
              developing field submicron electronics identifying potential problems, and
              resolving them early in the design cycle in order to reduce design cycle time
              and to ensure device reliability through smart design.  The requested equipment
              will be used to create (1) a laboratory facility for the measurement of the
              measurement of the thermal properties of thin film materials used in
              high-power, high-density integrated circuits, and (2) a microwave performance
              evaluation facility to perform simultaneous measurements of electrical and
              thermal characteristics of microwave monolithic integrated circuits.  ***
