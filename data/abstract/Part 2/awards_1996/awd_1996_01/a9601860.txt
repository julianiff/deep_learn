Abstract    :
              9601860  Bobba    Instrumentation for in-situ characterization of
              electrochemical  and optical materials and for graduate education in materials 
              science will be acquired by Southern University. This includes  development of
              an ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscope,  upgrade of a Fourier
              transform infrared spectrometer, and  acquisition of ultraviolet-visible-near
              infrared and fluorescence  spectrometers. Activities that will be supported
              include research  on electrocatalysts and electrolyte membranes for methanol
              fuel  cells, solid electrolytes and intercalated cathode materials, and 
              photonic materials including rare-earth-doped glasses and  ferroelectric
              crystals. The instrumentation will also support  instructional courses at the
              undergraduate level and in the newly  created MastersO program in Physics.  %%%
               The acquisition of the new instruments and implementation of the  research
              will strengthen faculty instructional quality and  provide a strong
              experimental research base in the Department of  Physics. Over seventy minority
              undergraduate students, ten new  graduate students in Physics, and the faculty
              in the College of  Sciences and Engineering will benefit from use of the 
              instrumentation.  ***
