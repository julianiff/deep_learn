Abstract    :
                The proposed instrumentation is-a state of the art protein sequencing  system.
              A major advantage of the ABI 494 "Procise" instrument is its  greatly increased
              sensitivity, allowing for reliable and extensive  sequence assignments to be
              made on femtomole quantity samples.  Additional advantages are the capability
              of running up to four samples,  and operation of the instrument through an
              intuitive Macintosh  interface, thus providing the potential for its use as a
              facile  research and teaching tool.    The instrument will facilitate the
              research objectives of faculty  members in every department in the College of
              Natural and Agricultural  Sciences, and Agricultural Experiment Station at U.
              C. Riverside (see  descriptions of faculty research programs below). The
              existing  instrument at the UCR Biotechnology Instrumentation Facility was 
              purchased 10 years ago, and is very difficult to maintain operational  because
              of scarcity of spare parts and by the fact that the  manufacturer no longer
              offers maintenance services.    Investigators using the sequencer are engaged
              in a variety of  research topic, including the characterization of protein
              kinases, ion  channel toxins, developmental hormones, fertilization proteins, 
              pathogenic bacterial proteins, polyamine transporters, and cytokines.    A
              second motivation for acquisition of this instrument is the  commitment on the
              part of College to provide a means of training  students in current
              technologies of protein analysis. As recent events  have illustrated,
              opportunities for appropriately trained personnel are  becoming increasingly
              available in areas of medical technology,  agriculture, and forensics. UCR has
              the opportunity to provide courses  and outreach programs that would bring this
              technology to the student  population. Students attending our institution
              deserve the best  training possible, and this instrument will provide our
              graduates with  access to current technology and a consequent advantage in
              their  employment searches.
