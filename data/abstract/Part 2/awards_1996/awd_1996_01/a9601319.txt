Abstract    :
              Roland J. Benabou  New York University  SBR-9601319    This research seeks to
              explain the following set of facts with  one economic model:  1) countries vary
              widely in their  redistributive policies, 2) higher levels of income inequality
               are associated with lower subsequent growth rates, 3) there is no 
              relationship between inequality and the share of transfers in GDP  and 4)
              transfers appear to be positively associated with  subsequent growth.  The
              emphasis of the research will be  primarily theoretical, as opposed to
              empirical.  It will seek to  explain the above set of facts without making
              overly restrictive  assumptions about individuals' behavior.  The principal 
              investigator will also look at technology adoption as a response  to
              heterogeneity in workers' skills, the hypothesis being that  heterogeneity in
              workers' skills leads to heterogeneity in  technologies and increased wage
              inequality.
