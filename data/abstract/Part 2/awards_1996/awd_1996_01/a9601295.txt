Abstract    :
              This project will extend the Youth/Parent Political Socialization Study, a
              national survey of high school seniors and their parents that began in 1965 and
              was successfully repeated in 1973 and 1982.  The fourth wave will focus on the
              original youth sample, now nearing age 50.  Interviews will also be conducted
              with parents and offspring ultimately yielding a three generational data set
              measuring political attitudes and behaviors of Americans.    The fourth wave
              will gauge long-term levels of persistence and change in political
              orientations.  With the respondents having undergone important life course
              transitions -- marital instability, parenthood, aging children and aging
              parents, occupational changes and career advancement -- the study offers a
              unique opportunity to evaluate the implications of these transitions for
              political continuity and change.  It also offers the opportunity to examine the
              short and long run attitudinal and behavioral consequences of major
              socio-political events bracketed by 1965 and 1997 and to investigate the
              individual level dynamics of major trends in political attitudes and behaviors
              over this period.  A second major aim of the study is to use the parent-child
              pairs, the respondent-spouse pairs and other family combinations that are
              imbedded in the design to trace the dynamics of socialization and interaction
              within the family.
