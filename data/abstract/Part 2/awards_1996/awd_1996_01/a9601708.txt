Abstract    :
              This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist
              the Department  of Chemistry at  Boston University to acquire a mass
              spectrometer. This equipment will enhance  research in a number of areas
              including the following: (1)photoinduced electron transfer in  synthetic
              peptide reaction centers, (2)antifreeze polypeptides and mineral binding
              polypeptides,  (3)T-cell signalling proteins, (4) test of the feasibility of
              using estrogen receptor protein , (5)  synthesis of N-bearing aromatic
              heterocycles, (6) the structure and mechanism of function of  membrane and some
              other proteins, (7)the isolation and structure determination of new, 
              biologically active natural products, and (8) basic iron acetates in catalytic
              oxidation of  hydrocarbons and biologically-related substrates.       Mass
              spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and
              to obtain  the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic,bioorganic,
              and organometallic molecules.  The addition of the technique of electrospray
              extends the range of MS to proteins and nucleic  acid molecular weights far
              beyond any other technique. The use of electrospray ionization in  combination
              with high resolution provides the latest techniques available in mass
              spectrometry.  It affords the chemist one of the most powerful tools available
              for the characterization of  compounds. The acquisition of this capability in
              mass spectrometry is essential for the  prosecution of frontier research in
              many fields of chemistry.
