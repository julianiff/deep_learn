Abstract    :
              Serious damages in buildings were reported in the disastrous earthquake which
              occurred in Kobe, Japan on January 17, 1995.  Those damages has raised concern
              on the design of columns.  Specifically, the adequacy of the current design
              code in preventing brittle failure of columns is called into question.  This
              problem is not limited to the Japanese building code (AIJ 1989) but also
              extends to the US code (ACI 1995).  Both codes are constructed on similar
              fundamental concept, in which structural collapse is prevented by ensuring
              ductility in structures under excessive seismic load by means of closely
              arranged transverse reinforcement.  However, structural damage observed in Kobe
              revealed that transverse reinforcement does not necessarily provide the
              elements with sufficient ductility, and that further design consideration is
              necessary to enhance seismic safety.  The Advanced Material Research Laboratory
              at the University of Michigan has developed super ductile cementitious
              composites with ultimate tensile strain capacity over 5%.  These engineered
              cementitious composites (ECC) have been applied to shear beams and beam-column
              joints.  The initial experimental investigations demonstrated that ECCs
              contribute extensively to enhancing structural performance especially in terms
              of ductility.  It is reasonable to expect that the application of ECCs could
              lead to substantial improvement in ductility of columns synergistic with
              transverse reinforcement, resulting in the reduction of seismic risks.   This
              project is aimed at establishing the proper design of a ECC material
              specifically for use in weak columns.  The research involves analytic
              components on seismic design of structures with ECC columns, as well as
              experimental verification of ECC and ECC column response.  Applications of
              ductile cementitious composite and its design procedure to other critical
              structural elements for improved seismic safety of buildings and civil
              infrastructures will be investigated.  This is a project supported under the
              second year program of NSF initiative or `Composite and Hybrid Structures`,
              NSF-94-154.
