              Research Infrastructure: Acquisition of a High-Performance Computing Facility  
               This Academic Research Infrastructure award supports the acquisition of a high
              speed SMD computing system operating at a peak speed of approximately 15
              GFLops.    The research projects supported by the equipment include:    1.
              Computational materials science in the NSF funded Materials Research
              Laboratory.    2. Computational chemistry in crystal growth, zeolite
              properties, and surface chemistry.    3. The computational investigation of
              electronic microstructures.    4. Simulation of 3-D ground motion in earthquake
              simulations of the LA basin.    5. Quantum chromodynamics.    6. Fluid
              mechanics, geophysical fluid dynamics, and free and moving boundary problems.  
               7. Research at the Institute of Theoretical Physics, the National Center for
              Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, and the Alexandria Digital Library project. 
                8. Research in computer science, numerical mathematics, and general
              scientific computation for SMD architectures.
