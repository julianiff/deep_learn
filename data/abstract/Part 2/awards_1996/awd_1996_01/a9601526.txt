Abstract    :
              This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will   assist
              the Department of Chemistry at Wellesley College acquire a 360 MHz   NMR
              Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of   areas
              including the following: (1) metabolic studies of a nitrogen   storage polymer
              in cyanobacteria, and  (2)  synthesis and 13C and 1H NMR   characterization of
              alkanethiolate-gold cluster monolayers.   Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules.    It is used to identify unknown
              substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution.  Access
              to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR studies are useful
              in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
