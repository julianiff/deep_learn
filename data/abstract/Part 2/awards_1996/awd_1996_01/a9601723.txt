Abstract    :
              9601723  Reger  University of South Carolina Columbia  This award from the
              Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist the Department of
              Chemistry & Biochemistry at the University of South Carolina at Columbia
              upgrade the existing 500 MHz NMR spectrometer and aquire a graphics
              workstation. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including the following: (1) catalytic properties of high nuclearity mixed
              metal cluster complexes (2)  studies of the catalytic ring opening
              cyclooligomerization of sulfur-containing heterocycles by transition metal
              cluster compounds  (3) investigations of natural products, specifically the
              isolation of medicinally active compound(s) from four different trees from the
              Ivory Coast (4) structural studies of covalently cross-linked DNA hairpins (5)
              small-molecule DNA-binding agents, and (6) syntheses and metal NMR studies of
              model complexes.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
              molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to a state-of-the-art NMR
              is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results
              from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and
              in biology.
