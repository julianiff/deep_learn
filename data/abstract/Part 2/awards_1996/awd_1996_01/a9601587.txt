Abstract    :
              9601587  Bacon       The PIS request funding to acquire an Inductively  Coupled
              Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) and an isotope  ratio monitoring-Gas
              Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (irm-  GC/MS). They propose to operate both
              instruments as  institution facilities (`cost centers') with dedicated 
              managers for daily operations, maintenance and training of  new users.  The
              facilities will be under the supervision of  a scientific management committee
              consisting of  representatives from marine chemistry, paleoceanography, and 
              petrology.  Specific applications for the ICP-MS include  analysis of
              long-lived radionuclides, rare earths, platinum  group elements and other trace
              elements in water, sediment,  rocks and marine microfossils.  The irm-GC/MS
              will fulfill  two general needs  - compound specific isotopic measurements  of
              13C and 15 N and  microscale measurements of 13 C and 15  N and 34 S in bulk
              samples.  These measurements will be  applied to studies of the contemporary
              and paleo oceans.  WHOI will cost share $290,000,  which represents 47% of the 
              total funding for this project.  ***
