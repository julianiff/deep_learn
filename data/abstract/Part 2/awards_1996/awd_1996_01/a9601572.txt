Abstract    :
               University Park  This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI)
              Program will   assist the Department of Chemistry at the Pennsylvania State
              University   (PSU) acquire a widebore 500 MHz NMR spectrometer. This equipment
              will   enhance the solid-state chemistry and materials science research at PSU 
               in a number of areas including the following: (1) synthesis and   applications
              of novel boron-containing polymers (2) design, synthesis and   characterization
              of microporous, mesoporous, and macroporous materials   (3) atomic connectivity
              and local structure in a variety of lamellar and   microporous materials (4)
              amorphous alkali phosphates and   aluminophosphates, crystalline zeolites and
              aluminophosphates and   solid-state biomolecules (5) amorphous materials and
              surfaces (6)    characterization of catalytic materials, and (7) elucidation of
                mechanisms and intermediates in catalytic systems   Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists
              for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to identify
              unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in
              solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR
              studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
