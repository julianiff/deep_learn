              Research Infrastructure:  Acquisition of a High-Performance Parallel Computer
              for Computer Science Modeling Research    This Academic Research Infrastructure
              award supports the acquisition of a four node, high performance computer.   
              The projects supported by this equipment are the development of optimized
              parallel computational models of the dynamics and energetics of global scale
              atmospheric circulation and the development of formal methods and models for
              the specification and validation of software system requirements.
