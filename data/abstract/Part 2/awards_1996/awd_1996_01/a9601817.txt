              Academic Research Infrastructure:  Acquisition of a Grand Challenge Data
              Laboratory    This Academic Research Infrastructure award supports the
              acquisition of Grand Challenge Data Laboratory consisting of a high speed
              computational cluster, visualization equipment, fast disk storage, mass storage
              capability, and a high speed network interconnect.    The research project
              supported by the equipment include:    1. Aerospace engineering research
              involving clustered fields projects.  These projects have applications in the
              design of aircraft, the solution of three-dimensional superconductivity
              problems, and the solution of distributed control at Colorado.    2.
              Geophysical and astrophysical turbulence problems exemplified by the research
              of the Grand Challenge Application Group team funded at Colorado.    3. The
              development of multi-cluster computing algorithms using new mass stores and
              high speed networks.    4. Parallel tools and performance evaluation in a
              distributed computing environment.    5. Visualization of very large datasets.
