              CTS - 9601508  Lakshmi N. Sridhar  U of Puerto Rico Mayaguez    ABSTRACT    
              This project is concerned with the use of software like ASPEN PLUS, GAMS and
              ASCEND for the development of undergraduate design projects for students.  The
              department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Puerto Rico has over
              500 undergraduate students.  It is imperative that the students receive a
              modern computer-aided education that will enable them to use and interpret the
              results from the software available and prepare them for the design of
              processes and process equipment.  As a large majority of our students go to
              work in the chemical industry, such exposure to using software like ASPEN PLUS
              will be a tremendous asset for them.  At this time, the department suffers from
              lack of modern computational equipment like work-stations.  This project will
              provide the students with exposure to chemical engineering software like ASPEN
              PLUS, ASCEND and GAMS.  Two work stations will be hooked up to the personal
              computers.  The primary objective is to enable students to use the software and
              participate in the various computer aided design projects.  This project will
              provide a new, modern and a computer aided process design instruction and
              enable students to be better prepared for the rapidly developing automation in
              the chemical process industry.
