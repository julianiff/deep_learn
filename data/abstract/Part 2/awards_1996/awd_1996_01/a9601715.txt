Abstract    :
              9601715  Pingitore    This grant provides $111,126 as partial support of the
              costs  of acquiring an X-ray microfluorescence (XRMF) spectrometer.  This
              instrument is comparable to an energy dispersive XRF  but has a very narrow
              collimated X-ray beam which allows non-  destructive elemental analyses of
              geological and  archaeological samples at relatively high spatial  resolutions
              (~ 30 microns).  Although this instrument is  also comparable to an electron
              microprobe (EMP) in many of  its capabilities, the XRMF can handle much larger
              samples  and little to no sample preparation is required making XRMF  analyses
              relatively simple to learn and therefore amenable  to undergraduate student
              involvement.  This instrument will  be used for a variety of interdisciplinary
              research topics  at this largest Hispanic-majority institution in the U.S. 
              including, non-destructive compositional analyses of rare  archaeological
              artifacts such as pottery shards and bone as  indicators of source material
              locations and thus settlement  patterns and dietary habits of ancient
              civilizations,  analyses of the Sr/Ca ratio in growth banded corals as  proxies
              for paleo sea surface temperatures and the analyses  of plant tissues for toxic
              metals in environmental studies.  ***
