Abstract    :
              9601418  Just    Scholars have long recognized that the analysis of public
              opinion alone, cannot explain which campaign communications influence voters. 
              Likewise the study of campaign media cannot by itself explain how citizens
              respond to specific messages.  The objective of this research is to advance the
              study of media and elections by rigorously preparing, documenting, archiving ,
              and disseminating data from a wide-ranging content analysis of the 1996
              presidential campaign.  The accessibility of these data will help researchers
              to unite the study of the campaign at the macro level - - what happened and how
              it is reported and talked about in the mass media - - with the study of
              individual behavior at the micro level - - who uses which media, what they
              learn, and how they decide to vote.      A consortium of media scholars will
              undertake a wide-ranging content analysis of campaign media including
              traditional news outlets:  network television news (ABC, CBS, and NBC), the New
              York Times, a sample of newspapers.,  and news magazines, political
              advertising, speeches and debates, as well as newer forms of campaign media: 
              televised candidate interviews, talk radio and specialized cable programming. 
              The analysis uses a consistent instrument so that media can be rigorously
              compared and can be interfaced with the schedule of questions in the 1996
              National Election Studies survey.      A major portion of the work of the
              content analysis is already supported by grants from the Pew Charitable Trust
              and the Markle Foundation.  This part of the project is directed at
              facilitating the archiving and dissemination of this massive data set for use
              by the community os social science scholars.  ***
