Abstract    :
              9601721  Goodwin  This proposal is a request for funding for a magnetic 
              suspension balance system.  This equipment will be used for  two basic types of
              measurements: (1) sorption measurements  relating to environmental remediation
              and bioprocessing  problems, and (2) density and vapor pressure measurements on
               fluids and fluid mixtures.  A major initial focus for this  joint work will be
              on systems designed to elucidate the  fundamental mechanisms in bioremediation
              of soils  contaminated with volatile organics  and other toxic  substances.  In
              addition, bioprocessing applications include  measurements on protein
              ion-exchange systems and on drying  of foods and agricultural products.
