Abstract    :
              Gravitational waves are a potential new window to view the  universe.  The
              Michigan group will join the LIGO (Laser  Interferometer Gravitational-wave
              Observatory) team  designing, constructing, and using the LIGO facility.  Their
               initial effort would be to assist in the 40 Meter  Interferometer (the LIGO
              prototype-test bench) Research and  Development Program.  Gustafson would be
              substantially  resident at the 40 Meter, and become competent to run the 
              interferometer.  The goal would be to support the R/D  program, using the 40
              Meter as an operational device,  working within the framework of the current
              R/D test,  addition, or upgrade program.  They would keep the  interferometer
              active, dealing with the residual problems  and exploring operational
              realities.  Data collection, would  become a norm, and analysis attempted at
              the 10**-19 level  in sensitivity, with the spurious noise sources understood 
              and eliminated.  This activity would contribute to the LIGO Detector and 
              Facility effort, and to the `Advanced LIGO` concept.  All  actions would be
              deferential to the R/D program, mostly in  the mode of `diagnose, discuss, fix
              as agreed`.  This  program is an example of an operational working relationship
               between LIGO and the University user community.
