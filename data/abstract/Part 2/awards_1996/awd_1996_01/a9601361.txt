Abstract    :
                                              9601361  Kuo                                 
              This is a 24 month award proposed by Dr. T.T.S. Kuo, SUNY at  Stony Brook and
              T.S.H. Lee, Argonne National Laboratory; and  Dr. Yiharn Tzeng, Academia Sinica
              and Dr. S.Y. Tsay,  National Taipei Institute of Technology.  This proposal 
              requests funds for travel to Taiwan to work jointly with  Taiwan scientists on
              the dynamics of  hadron systems. The  research activities include two major
              components: (1)  calculation of a pion equation of  states at high density 
              and/or high temperature and (2) studies of hypernuclei with  three body forces.
              The scientists from the U.S. and Taiwan  will work together to see whether a
              mathematical model can  be developed which can better describe the results
              derived  from the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator (CEBAF) and  the
              Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) experiments.  This study is timely and
              relevant to the understanding of  the important experiments on the Continuous
              Electron Beam  Accelerator and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.  The 
              project is jointly supported by the Taiwan National Science  Council and the
              NSF.
