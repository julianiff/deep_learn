Abstract    :
              The State University of New York College at Fredonia prepares to  advocate the
              significant impact and findings of the nationwide  funded Summer Science Camps
              (SSC) by publishing the "Summer Science  Camp Accountability Document" and
              disseminating these findings to  local, regional, state and nationwide
              educational, scientific and  gubernatorial institutions and organizations to
              make the SSC  experiences widely useful and usable.  In view that the NSF sides
               with and encourages open scientific communication from research and 
              educational activities developed in their funding programs, hence  this
              proposal seeks to achieve these objectives:    To have the "SSC Accountability
              Document" available for potential  math and science project directors who want
              to know and find  projects to visit and to work in.    To make available the
              "SSC Accountability Document" to  congressional offices, foundations, private
              corporations, public  libraries, postsecondary institutions, and other agencies
              which  want to know what is being done for disadvantages students in 
              interesting them and guiding them toward the fields of math and  science as
              career avenues.    To offer the "SSC Accountability Document" to current
              project  directors who want to advertise and distribute their SSC programs  to
              funding agencies and by others as a source of data about their  nationwide math
              and science early intervention programs for  disadvantaged students.  ***
