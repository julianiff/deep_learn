Abstract    :
              9601478  Clayton    This grant, made through the Academic Research
              Infrastructure (ARI)  Program, provides $410,000 as partial support of the
              costs of  acquiring a high-resolution inductively coupled mass spectrometer 
              (HR-ICP-MS) equipped with a laser ablation microprobe for the  Department of
              Geophysical Sciences at the University of Chicago.   The primary use of this
              instrument will be for siderophile and  chalcophile trace elemental analyses of
              mantle derived rocks and  meteorites as proxies for their petrogenesis and
              indicators of  early planetary differentiation.  An accurate estimate of the 
              siderophile (i.e. Re, Os Ir, Pd, Pt, Au) elemental abundances and  their
              microspatial distributions in mantle materials will provide  clues to the
              formation conditions of the early Earth.  Other uses  of the HR-ICP-MS will
              include studies of paleo-redox conditions  through determination of the
              abundances of redox sensitive trace  elements in marine sediments.  ***
