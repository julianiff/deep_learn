Abstract    :
              9601357  Arjomand  This project investigates the long-term processes of
              sociolegal change set in motion by the meeting of the Western and the Islamic
              legal and political regimes.  It offers analytical descriptions and a
              typological classification of the forms of law and political organization in
              the Islamic Middle East before the impact of modern constitutionalism. It then
              focuses on the legal consequences of modernizing change and the undermining of
              constitutionalism in the legal and political traditions of the Islamic Middle
              East that resulted from these changes.  Public and constitutional law will be
              considered the critical link between political organization and the legal
              system. The modernizers' attempts at rational political reconstruction and
              legal reform invoked support, resistance and counter-proposals among different
              social forces and vested institutional interests which engaged in a political
              struggle that determined constitutional change at decisive turning points.  The
              method for this study is comparative, and uses a historically circumscribed
              typology to account for the variations, in time and across countries, of the
              constitutional outcomes and political regimes in the Islamic Middle East.
