Abstract    :
              Tsai  9601530    A high speed flow visualization and high resolution droplet
              imaging systems which will be purchased to support research and research
              training of both graduate and undergraduate students in engineering.  Major
              components of the systems are: an Oxford copper vapor laser strobe Model
              LS10-50 with pulse repetition frequency from single shot to 50,000 flashes per
              second, a CCD video camera, light sheet optics, an optical bench, Particle
              Image Velocimetry software, and a 100 MHz Pentium computer with an HP laser jet
              printer 5P.  The system will be used for research projects on atomization of
              slurry jets.     The requested instrumentation will be used to improve research
              and research training of both graduate and undergraduate students.  The
              Department started its graduate program four years ago and graduated five
              Master degree students last year; and it is among the top 15-20% in production
              of B.S. in Chemical Engineering in the Western United States.  ***
