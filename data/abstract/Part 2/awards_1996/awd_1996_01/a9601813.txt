Abstract    :
              9601813  Kevan    Instrumentation to characterize organic and inorganic solids
              and  polymers will be acquired by the University of Oregon. The  instruments
              are a gel permeation chromatography system, a cross-  polarization with magic
              angle spinning probe for solid state  nuclear magnetic resonance, and an x-ray
              powder diffractometer.  Research efforts that will use this instrumentation
              encompass the  areas of molecular self-assembly, polymer synthesis and 
              photodegradation, organic conducting materials, fabrication of  non-linear
              optical devices, and superlattices and nanostructured  materials. Students and
              faculty from the Department of Chemistry  and from the Materials Science
              Institute participate in the  research.  %%%  Organic and inorganic solids
              possess unusual optical, electronic,  and mechanical properties that are of
              fundamental and  technological importance. The instrumentation will allow for a
               detailed knowledge of the chemical composition and microscopic  structure of
              these solids that is key to understanding and  exploiting the properties of
              these materials in such fields as  superconductivity, catalysis, and
              semiconductor processing.  StudentsO experiences gathering and analyzing data
              with this new  instrumentation will strengthen their training in the area of 
              materials and surface science.  ***
