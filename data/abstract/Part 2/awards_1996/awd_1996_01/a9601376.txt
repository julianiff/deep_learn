Abstract    :
              9601376  Slemrod    This award supports participation of two US investigators, 
              Marshall Slemrod of the University of Wisconsin and Shi Jin  of Georgia
              Institute of Technology, in a cooperative  research project on relaxation
              models for dynamic phase  transitions with Zheng Songmu from Fudan University, 
              Shanghai, China and Wang Jinghua from the Institute of  System Science, Chinese
              Academy of Sciences, Beijing.  The  project will employ formal and rigorous
              mathematical  analysis, numerical analysis and scientific computation to 
              investigate dynamic phase transitions arising in many  important physical
              processes.  This research addresses an  important problem in modeling materials
              and processes.    Strengthening cooperation in mathematics and computation 
              sciences with China, which has a long tradition of  excellence in mathematics
              and a recent emphasis in  computational science, is important.  The Chinese
              Academy of  Sciences' Institute of Systems Science and the Mathematics 
              Institute at Fudan University are leading centers in China  in these fields,
              and collaboration among these researchers  should prove quite effective.
