              Research Infrastructure:  Acquisition of Research Equipment for High-Speed
              Computing and Networking Initiative    This Academic Research Infrastructure
              award supports the acquisition of a four high speed ATM networks for research
              in networking and high performance computing.    The projects supported by this
              equipment are:    1. High speed communications and networking research
              including architectures and algorithms for wireless and multimedia
              communications, VLSI implementation of ATM switch fabrics, low power
              communication systems, optoelectronic ATM switch design, and test vector
              generation.    2. Design and performance analysis of networked systems
              including design for dependability techniques and assessment and performance
              evaluation methods.    3. Distributed applications on high speed networks
              including distributed computing applications, networked laboratory
              applications, and network based collaborative engineering.
