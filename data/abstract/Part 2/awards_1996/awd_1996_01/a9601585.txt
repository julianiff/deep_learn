Abstract    :
                  9601585  Lambropoulos  This Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) award is
              to partially  support the acquisition of a nanoindenter/nanoscratcher that will
               be used to study near-surface material properties.  A Highly 
              interdisciplinary group of researchers will use this equipment to  study a wide
              range of topics including mechanical properties,  densification of silica,
              scratch testing of glasses, interfacial  surface energies, cohesive forces in
              particles and thin polymer  films.  There is a significant educational and
              training component  in the research activities that will use this equipment
              including  short courses for local industry.  ***
