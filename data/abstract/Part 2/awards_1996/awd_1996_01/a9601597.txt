Abstract    :
              9601597  Reckhow  This is an award to provide support for purchase of 
              analytical  equipment to be used in support of environmental engineering 
              research at the University of Massachusetts.  The equipment  to be  obtained as
              a result of this award will be used on research  to  chemically modify the
              structure of recalcitrant organic  compounds  in such a way as to render them
              more biologically  degradable.  While principally addressed to research on
              water treatment  processes, the equipment is also expected to contribute to 
              research on issues in air pollution control and  decontamination  of
              groundwater.  The proposal leading to this award was submitted in response  to 
              the National Science Foundation's Instrumentation  Development and  Acquisition
              Solicitation, NSF 96-8, Academic Research  Infrastructure (ARI) Program. 
              Results of this award are  expected  to improve the accessibility of modern
              research  instrumentation  for use by this institution's faculty in conducting
              research  on  important topics of environmental significance and in  educating 
              students.
