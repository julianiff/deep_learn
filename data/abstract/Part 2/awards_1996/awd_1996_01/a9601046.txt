Abstract    :
              This project is an investigation into some computational problems  that  arise
              in the physical mapping and sequencing of chromosomal  DNA.  The  goals  of 
              the  project are  (1)  to  investigate  new  strategies  for  certain  parts of
              these computations,  aimed  at  improving speed and/or reducing the amount of
              expert intervention  required, while preserving solution quality, and (2) to 
              add  new  capabilities  to  existing  mapping  and  sequencing  systems.  A 
              pervasive  theme  throughout the project is to take  experimental  error into
              account in the computations.    The  investigation into physical mapping
              concentrates largely  on  one method in use at the University of Washington's
              Department of  Molecular Biotechnology, namely Multiple Complete Digest
              mapping.  Within the map assembly stage of this method, new algorithms  are 
              being  investigated for identifying the clone fragment containing  the  cloning
              vector, determining which clone fragments arise from  identical  fragments on
              the target DNA being mapped,  determining  the  probability  of pairwise clone
              overlap,  and  other  related  problems.    In  addition, the project includes
              investigations into a  general  placement  problem  in physical mapping, a
              method  of  sequencing  without  mapping,  and  the  effects  of  experimental 
              error  on  molecular computation.    The   principal  investigators  will  use 
              their  experience   in  algorithm  design  and  analysis to  help  establish  a
               rigorous  foundation  for  the  computational aspects of  these  biological 
              problems.  This  may  in  turn result in  direct  impact  on  the  experimental
              methods used.
