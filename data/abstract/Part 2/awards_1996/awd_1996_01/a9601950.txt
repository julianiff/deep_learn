Abstract    :
              Abstract  9601950  Gaisser  This is an Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI)
              award to upgrade the instrumentation for the South Pole Air Shower Experiment
              (SPASE) and to provide analysis equipment for the home laboratory at Bartol
              Research Institute at the University of Delaware.  SPASE has three main
              scientific goals:  to search for sources of ultra high energy gamma rays; by
              working in conjunction with the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array
              (AMANDA), which is a detector buried deep in the ice below South Pole, to
              determine the elemental composition of very high energy cosmic rays; and to
              provide pointing calibration for AMANDA.  The equipment funded by this grant
              will be especially useful in the composition studies, an area of the highest
              priority in the cosmic ray physics community.    SPASE is a collaborative
              effort of Bartol and the University of Leeds (UK).  Funds for this award is
              being provided by both the Antarctic Aeronomy and Astrophysics Program and the
              Office of Science and Technology Infrastructure.  ***
