Abstract    :
              9601453  Zhang      This award supports continued development of a cooperative 
              research and education program between RPI and the Institute  of Physics,
              Beijing.  This recommended award is supplemental  to the PI's CAREER award
              through the Division of Electrical  and Communication Systems.    The research
              involves generation of intense terahertz  radiation that will open new research
              areas in the  characterization of electrical, optical, and optoelectronics 
              materials and devices. Applications are also likely in  characterization of
              biological materials for medical  applications. Many technical benefits are
              associated with  this cooperation with China.  The Chinese group has 
              acknowledged expertise growing and cutting the nonlinear  crystals which are
              essential to the research., and has state  of the art laser facilities,
              enabling them to carry out  significant parts of the experiments. Chinese
              scientists,  supported by Chinese funding sources, will be trained  further at
              RPI in ultrafast electronics.  The benefits to  both sides are substantial and
              equitable.    An important part of this program is the participation of 
              graduate and undergraduate US  students. Based on the  success of a one-year
              pilot program, the PI proposes to  extend the opportunity to up to sixteen
              students over the  next four years to participate in a research program 
              involving experiments conducted both at RPI and in China.
