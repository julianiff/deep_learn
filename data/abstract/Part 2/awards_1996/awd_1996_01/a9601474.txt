Abstract    :
              It is widely recognized that people are strongly motivated to maintain a
              positive conception of themselves and a consistent, meaningful conception of
              the world in which they live.  Until recently, however, little attention has
              been paid to the question of why these very basic human motives exist.  The
              current research is focused on a theoretical explanation for these motives. 
              The theory (Terror Management Theory) suggests that self-esteem and cultural
              worldviews serve the psychological function of protecting people from the
              terror they feel when they contemplate or become aware of their own inevitable
              death.  For this reason, it is proposed that people invest a significant amount
              of effort in maintaining faith in their own worldviews and belief in their own
              self-worth.  Accumulating experimental research, conducted in four different
              countries, provides support for this analysis.  The goal during the current
              funding period is to extend Terror Management Theory to better understand its
              domain of application, and to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying
              psychological processes that produce the documented effects.  A broad range of
              experimental methods will be used to examine such behaviors as stereotyping,
              helping, and efforts to persuade others.
