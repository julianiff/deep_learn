Abstract    :
                    9601164  Briggs  As sessile organisms, plants have evolved the capacity to
              respond to a wide range of environmental signals, one of the most important of
              which is light.  Indeed, virtually every phase of a plant's development is
              regulated by its light environment.  These collective responses are encompassed
              by the term photomorphogenesis.  Since Koornneef et al. first described the hy
              (long hypocotyl) mutants of Arabidopsis, mutants have been central to
              photomorphogenesis research.  The present award to study signal transduction in
              a blue light-activated system, phototropism, also relies heavily on the use of
              mutants.  Dr. Brigg's laboratory has recently isolated a number of severe
              phototropism mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana designated nph for non-phototropic
              hypocotyl.  They fall into four complementation groups, nph1-4.  All five
              alleles of the first group, nph1, are deficient in or lack the phosphoprotein
              but show normal gravitropism, and it is the NPH1 gene that is focal point for
              this proposal.  The working hypothesis is that NPH1 is the gene that encodes
              the phosphoprotein.  As the weakest allele(nph1-2) shows altered spectral
              sensitivity for phototropism, NPH1 may itself be the photoreceptor.      This
              research will contribute to extending our knowledge about the many ways in
              which light plays a role in plant growth and development.
