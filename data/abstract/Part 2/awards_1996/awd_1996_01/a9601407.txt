Abstract    :
                This dissertation enhancement grant provides partial support for a U.S.
              graduate student, Scott Johnston, working under the guidance of Dr. John
              Schwille, Assistant Dean of International Studies at Michigan State University,
              to perform a study on the construction of mentor roles in science education
              teachers in Zimbabwe.  Mr. Johnston will examine A-level science teachers in
              Zimbabwe participating in the Science Education In-Service Teacher Training
              project (SEITT) to determine how these teachers incorporate the pedagogy and
              concepts that they learn through SEITT into their own teaching styles and
              mentoring relationships.  The results of this project will provide important
              feedback on the effectiveness of SEITT which will allow the project leaders to
              revise the program while it is still in an early stage.  Staff members of the
              Science and Mathematics Education Department at the University of Zimbabwe will
              collaborate with Mr. Johnston on this project.  This study will make an
              important contribution to the understanding of the development and usefulness
              of mentoring roles for science education teachers.  The grant will also provide
              support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent
              research career.
