Abstract    :
              Quantum logic is the study of the deep structural properties of quantum
              mechanics, the  fundamental physical theory of matter and energy.  This project
              involves three aspects of  research in quantum logic and its applications: (1)
              the philosophical foundations of quantum  logic, (2) the use of situation
              theory to describe information transfer in quantum mechnical  systems, and (3)
              fundamental questions about the nature of computation raised by the possibility
               of quantum computers.  (A quantum computer is a quantum mechanical system that
              performs  abstract computations.  Some computations can run on quantum
              computers for significantly  lower cost than they run on physcial computers.)  
               The topics are linked in the following way.  Quantum logic supplies the
              algebraic structure  necessary for situation theory, which in turn offers a
              formal model of information transfer in  quantum mechanical systems.  Quantum
              logic underlies the logic gates of quantum computers,  much as classical logic
              characterizes the logic gates of classical computers.  Quantum situation 
              theory is useful for evaluating arguments about the non-local character of
              certain quantum  systems that may be used to send information faster than the
              speed of light.  Together, quantum  logic and quantum situation theory will
              allow the PI to address questions about the essential  nature of quantum
              computation and its relationship with classical computation.
