Abstract    :
              9601411  McGee  Mechanisms regulating enzymatic reactions on membranes will  be
              studied using membrane-dependent proteases as  experimental model systems.  The
              kinetics of these systems  will be analyzed under biologically relevant
              conditions by  tracer dilution techniques in continuously perfused cultures  of
              intact cells.   Effects of hydration and electrostatic  forces will be
              investigated under controlled osmotic stress,  ionic strength and temperature. 
              Available theoretical  treatments of reaction kinetics will be selected and 
              combined on the basis of experimental data, to arrive at a  general model
              equation.  This equation will incorporate  easily identifiable parameters and
              will have immediate  practical uses in membrane research.  %%%  The proposed
              studies will provide new and fundamental  information on the catalytic function
              of biological  membranes.  This information will serve to predict the role  of
              diffusion and the consequences of colloidosmotic  fluctuations on
              membrane-reactions in vivo.  The predictive  models, developed on the basis of
              this research, will be  applicable to a large group of physiologically
              important  protease pathways and will fill major gaps in the general 
              understanding of mechanisms controlling reactions on  surfaces.  ***
