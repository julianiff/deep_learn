Abstract    :
              9601658  Chamberlin  University of California Irvine  This award from the
              Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist the Department of
              Chemistry at the University of California at Irvine upgrade the existing 500
              MHz and 300 MHz  NMRs. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
              areas including the following: (1)  signaling mechanisms in the central nervous
              system  (2) new models for monodisperse silica-supported catalysts (3)
              strategies for the formation of peptide b-sheets  (4) new reactions and
              strategies that allow the efficient assembling of complex molecules with high
              stereo- and enantiocontrol (5) polyene macrolide antibiotics (6) synthetic
              methodology/natural product synthesis and polymer syntheses/materials chemistry
              (7) research of compounds which contain indole rings coupled at the 2 position,
              and (8) new reactions of silacyclopropanes.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to
              state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
              frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
              such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
