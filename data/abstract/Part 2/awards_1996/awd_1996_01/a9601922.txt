Abstract    :
              ***  9601922  Zhang  This grant will provide partial support for a high-power
              all  solid-state laser system for research in the Physics  Department of
              Georgia Southern University.  This system will  be tunable from the ultraviolet
              to the mid-infrared, will  have high power (10 GW), and will be ultrafast (200
              fsec).  The system will be used in the on-going research programs of  the
              Department, including  a study of the response of atoms  to ultrafast laser
              fields, and a study of laser induced  transparency in a gaseous medium.  ***
