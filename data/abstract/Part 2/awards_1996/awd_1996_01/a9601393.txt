Abstract    :
              This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
              from UCLA, studying the effects of political violence on the moral development
              of children.  The project will ask how and when moral proscriptions against
              violence are universally binding or context-specific, and whether children's
              moral rules are more similar to those of children from other cultures or those
              within their own culture, holding socio-economic class constant.  Thirty male
              and female children from 3 age ranges (5-7, 8-10, 11-13) in 3 subsamples (urban
              upper class, urban  middle class, rural poor) will be interviewed as well as 30
              male and female adults in El Salvador, as well as a US sample of children and
              adults in .  In each case a questionnaire consisting of 36 behavioral cases of
              `wrong` behavior will presented and the persons asked to comment on its
              morality in diverse contexts.  This project is important because it will
              advance our understanding of how children learn moral rules.  Testing the
              proposition that the development of such rule is culture-specific as opposed to
              cross-culturally stable will contribute valuable information to bear on this
              question.  At a time when many in US society bemoan the lack of values among
              the youth, a project such as this will provide valuable information on the
              source of and variation in moral values in children.
