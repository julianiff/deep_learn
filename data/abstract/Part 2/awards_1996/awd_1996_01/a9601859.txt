Abstract    :
                  9601859  LaBerge  This Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) award provides
               partial support for the purchase of a testing system for the  study of
              orthopaedic bearing surfaces.  The system consists of a  knee joint simulator
              permits the non-contact surface  profilometer.  The knee joint simulator
              permits the simultaneous  bench assessment of implant performance of up to six
              joints.  The  non-contact surface profilometer will be used in reconstructive 
              surgery.  The equipment will be used in an interactive academic  research
              program in orthopedic materials and tribology where both  undergraduate and
              graduate students are involved.  ***
