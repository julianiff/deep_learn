Abstract    :
              9601283  Kolesar    A high-vacuum, thin-film deposition system and a
              microelectronic integrated circuit (IC) photolithographic mask aligner with a
              sub-micron resolution capability will be purchased.  Both instruments are
              fundamental to the well established technology of microelectronic device
              fabrication and the emerging field of microelectromechanical sensors and
              actuators. The acquisition of these two instruments will facilitate
              accomplishing a long-term micosensor research thrust by the principal
              investigator, three senior faculty research personnel, and a team of
              engineering students who master their functionality in a related
              microelectronic device fabrication research oriented laboratory experience.   
              The scientific and engineering goal of this research project is to
              synergistically integrate the well-established technology of integrated circuit
              microelectronics with the emerging field of micromachining to design,
              fabricate, characterize, and optimize the performance of a complete
              microdynamical chemical analysis gas chromatography + dielectric and ion
              mobility spectroscopy (GC+D&IMS) system that is the microscale derivative of
              its conventional, large-scale, analytical chemistry, laboratory counterpart.   
              Successful accomplishment of this research will significantly advance the
              comprehensive goal of using autonomous microsensors to selectively detect and
              monitor the concentrations of a host of atmospheric environmental pollutants. 
              By leveraging the inherent cost-effective advantages of IC fabrication
              techniques, the micromachined GC system will emerge as an advanced analytical
              chemistry tool with numerous applications in environmental, commercial and
              military settings.  ***
