Abstract    :
              9601577  Brown    This grant provides $136,000 as partial support of  the costs
              of acquiring an inductively coupled  plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) for
              trace  elemental and isotopic ratio analyses for studies  in limnology and
              paleoclimatology at the  University of Minnesota - Duluth, Large Lakes 
              Observatory.  Specific research will focus on  anthropogenic influences on
              heavy metal  (particularly Pb and Cu) distributions and their  subsequent
              diagenetic remobilization in sediments  of Lake Superior and studies of redox
              sensitive  metals, trace metal ratios (i.e. Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca) in  ostracode tests
              and the Pb and Sr isotopic  variations found in lithic fragments from East 
              African Rift Lake sediments as proxies of climatic  and provenance changes over
              time.  This instrument  will provide a new regional capability for trace 
              elemental analyses of environmental samples and  will benefit undergraduate and
              graduate students  conducting limnological and geochemical research.  ***
