Abstract    :
              9601780  McGinn    A versatile state-of-the-art powder x-ray diffraction
              instrument consisting of 1) an x-ray generator, 2) a high precision
              multi-configuration goniometer, 3) a solid state detector 4) a position
              sensitive detector, 5) thin film attachments and 6) a high temperature furnace
              assembly, for multidisciplinary use will be purchased.    This equipment is
              intended to support research performed by 12 faculty from the Colleges of
              Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame.  The following
              capabilities will be made possible by the new system: 1) high temperature, 2)
              position sensitive detection for rapid data acquisition for studies of reaction
              kinetics, metastable phase formations, 3) a solid state detector for improved
              energy resolution and detection efficiency, 4) thin film capability for
              structural analysis of various film geometries 5) improved powder diffraction
              sensitivity, resolution and analysis, supported by a computer work station
              software for modeling and using cutting edge analytical algorithms.  Whether it
              be structural characterization of heterostructures, or the kinetics of chemical
              reactions, the proposed equipment is crucial for the continuation of the
              research and teaching efforts in Structural Characterization a t the University
              of Notre Dame.    The acquisition will have significant impact on the research
              programs of the four principle investigators.  Equally important is that the
              user base of the X-ray characterization facility and the number of trained
              users will quickly grow (as will result from this funding.  ***
