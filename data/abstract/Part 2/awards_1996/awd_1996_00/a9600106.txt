Abstract    :
              9600106  Dade    This grant supports the research of Professor E. Dade to work
              on problems in the representation of the finite groups. In particular he wants
              to work on a conjecture about the number of characters in a block of a finite
              group. He will complete work on reducing this conjecture to the case of
              covering groups of the finite simple groups. He will then try to directly
              verify cases of this conjecture using this reduction.     This is research in
              the field of group theory. Group theory can be thought of as the study of
              symmetry in the abstract. As such, this area has direct applications to many
              areas of physics and chemistry. Moreover, within the last 30 years, many
              connections to problems in data transmission have been solved using techniques
              from group theory. There are also direct connections to the error correcting
              codes that are vital for modern computing such as working with CD-ROM's.
