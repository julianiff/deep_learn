Abstract    :
              9600260  Fowler      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour  months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. James E. Fowler to work with Professor
              Michel  Barlaud at the University of Nice - Sophia Antipolis.  Their  project
              is entitled, "Wavelet-Based Subband Coding for Video  Using Adaptive Vector
              Quantization."        The use of digital computers in multimedia applications 
              demands efficient coding techniques for storing and  transmitting digital
              video.  Dr. Fowler and Professor  Barlaud plan to develop a new algorithm for
              video coding,  based on an integration of two image coding techniques: 
              adaptive vector quantification (AVQ) and wavelet based  subband coding.  They
              believe that this algorithm is better  suited for packet based video than the
              established Motion  Picture Experts Group (MPEG) standards.        ***
