Abstract    :
                   The aim of this project is to collect data on the Narpa  language, data
              that will be used by the Principal Investigator to  prepare for publication a
              grammar, dictionary, and a collection  of texts. Narpa is a member of the
              Tamangic group within the  Bodic branch of Tibeto-Burman. It is spoken in the
              Manang  District of Nepal by about 800 people. While the language is  still the
              principal medium of communication in two villages, the  small size of the
              population, the relative poverty of the people,  and their bilingualism in
              Nepali, the national language, all  point to the fact that the language could
              cease to be spoken  rather quickly. A couple of short word lists apart, there 
              currently is no published documentation on the Narpa language.       The
              grammar will be produced in a relatively  non-theoretical, descriptive
              framework so as to be of maximum  utility to Sino-Tibetanists, anthropologists,
              and general  linguists of various theoretical persuasions. The grammar and 
              dictionary will contain copious illustrations from both elicited  and textual
              material. The texts will be chosen to exemplify  several discourse types and a
              variety of cultural situations, and  will be accompanied by
              morpheme-by-morpheme glosses as well as  translations into idiomatic English.
              All three components    grammar, dictionary, texts   will be keyed to each
              other.
