Abstract    :
              9600366  Weibel    The PI will conduct a planning visit to Buenos Aires and  La
              Plata, Argentina to establish a collaboration with G.  Cortinas of Universidad
              de La Plata and O. Villamayor of  Universidad de Buenos Aires in the area of
              Hochschild and  cyclic homology.  The PI has already published with  Cortinas
              and will seek new directions with Villamayor and  his "BACH" group within their
              overlapping interests. One  conjecture of interest to all three is whether the
              trace  map from the algebraic K-theory of a Q-algebra to its  Hochschild
              homology preserves the decomposition given by  Adams operations; another,
              attributed to Berger, deals  with the module of Kaehler differentials over a
              regular  ring.    The collaborators conduct active research programs in the 
              proposed areas and the questions addressed are important  ones to the field. 
              The visit will provide the opportunity  to establish a clear plan to take
              advantage of the  combined efforts of the three researchers.      ***
