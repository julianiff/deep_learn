Abstract    :
              INT 9600518  Sen        This U.S-Czech mathematics project between Dr. Pranab
              Sen of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and Dr. Jana Jurechova of
              Charles University, Prague, will examine higher-order asymptotic properties of
              robust statistical procedures in the linear model and in more sophisticated
              contexts, such as models for longitudinal data.    The researchers intend to
              build upon their experience in nonparametric methods and asymptotic theory to
              refine procedures for several related areas: 1) k-step M-estimation in linear
              models; 2) second order robust estimation of regression parameters; 3)
              relations between r-estimators and regression rank scores estimators; and
              4)second order representations for statistical functionals.  Results are
              expected to lead to choices of estimators based on computational complexities
              that will be useful in situations when samples are of moderate size.  The
              researchers expect to apply their findings in the development of new
              statistical procedures with special emphasis on tests of hypotheses and on
              non-standard models that arise in biomedical and environmental applications.   
              This project is statistics and probability fulfills the program objective of
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the Unites States and
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence.      ??
