Abstract    :
              There are important questions which refer to gravity on very  tiny
              scales--scales where quantum gravity reigns--and  therefore they implicitly
              raise the prior question whether  spacetime is ultimately continuous or
              discrete.  No matter  what the answer here, discrete models of spacetime are 
              needed for practical reasons: for the computer simulations  which will tell us
              how to interpret the data coming from  gravitational wave telescopes like LIGO.
               This research would address the following specific topics  within this broad
              framework.  The methods would be both  analytic (paper and pencil computations
              and derivations) and  numerical (computer simulations).       properties of
              black holes: does the surface of the  black hole (its `horizon`) possess a
              `fractal` structure, as  Newtonian analysis indicates?       discrete
              spacetime: further development of Regge  Calculus as a practical tool for
              solving the Einstein  equations numerically; further development of causal set 
              theory, focusing on the issues of locality and the  cosmological constant.     
               spacetime topology and topology-change: what are the  properties of
              topological geons and what happens when they  are created and destroyed?      
              quantum cosmology: what are the observational effects  of the time varying
              cosmological constant indicated by  causal set theory?       sum-over-histories
              approach to quantum mechanics: how  can we continue to make predictions with
              quantum mechanics  in the presence of gravity?
