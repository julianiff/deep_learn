Abstract    :
              9600364  Fisher      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-  four months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions.    This award will support a twenty-one month
              postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Brian L. Fisher to work with Dr.  Hamish G.
              Robertson at the South African Museum in Cape  Town, South Africa.  Funding for
              this project is being  provided by the U.S.-South Africa Program.        Dr.
              Fisher will perform a systematic review of three groups  of endemic ants on
              Madagascar.  Ants are well suited for  analyzing historical patterns.  Because
              the elevational and  regional distributions of many ant species are restricted,
               they are ideal for determining patterns of endemism and  vicariance.  This
              study will provide important data on the  subject species and on the historical
              biogeography of the  region.  ***
