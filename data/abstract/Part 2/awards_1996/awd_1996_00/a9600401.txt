Abstract    :
              9600401  Huebner  Stutts    This award supports a 6 month National Science
              Foundation  Dissertation Enhancement Award for Mr. James R. Friend at  the
              Tokyo Institute of Technology (TIT), Tokyo, Japan.  Mr.  Friend, will work with
              Dr. Sadayuki Ueha, senior scientist  at TIT, on a research project entitled,
              "Analytical Modeling  of Ultrasonic Traveling Wave Motors".    The main
              objective of the research is to both perform  analytical modeling of ultrasonic
              traveling wave motors and  construct working prototypes of the models. 
              Piezoelectric  traveling wave motors provide promise for replacing  fractional
              horsepower motors in a wide variety of  applications.  The primary investigator
              has created a  theoretical model of a piezoelectric motor that, while  slower
              than those currently being developed in Japan, is far  more accurate in its
              prediction of the physical behavior of  the motor's operation.  Cooperation
              between scientists in  the United States and Japan on a project involving
              mutually  compatible theories would allow the development of more  effective
              models as well as the design, assembly, and  operation of actual working
              motors.  ***
