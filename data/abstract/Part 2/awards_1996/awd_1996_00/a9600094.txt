Abstract    :
              9600094  Feeny    This  project  combines the approaches  of  systematics  and 
              chemical ecology to investigate the factors controlling  the  number of host
              species attacked by wasps of the genus Trogus  (family  Ichneumonidae),  all
              species  of  which  parasitize  caterpillars of the butterfly family
              Papilionidae.    The  systematics  of  Trogus  and  related  genera  will  be 
              investigated  to  identify trends in the evolution  of  host  associations.  
              To  identify  mechanisms  of   host-finding,  behavioral  experiments  will be
              conducted  with  the  North  American species Trogus pennator.  By comparing
              the chemical  compounds used to locate host caterpillars on different food 
              plants,   this  research  will  test  the  hypothesis   that  taxonomic  
              restriction   in   host   range   results   from  conservative  responses to
              chemical  cues  shared  by  these  plants.    Parasitic wasps are the single
              most important natural  enemy  of  crop  pests.  Better understanding of their
              biology  may  suggest new ways to manipulate parasitoids and agroecosytems  for
              improved pest control and reduced use of insecticides.
