Abstract    :
                                              9600492  Eliel                                 
              This is a 12 month award proposed by Dr. Ernest Eliel,  American Chemical
              Society and Professor Tai-Shan Fang,  National Taiwan Normal University.  This
              proposal requests  funds to convene a U.S.-Taiwan symposium on innovations in 
              undergraduate education in chemistry.  This symposium will  be modeled after
              the U.S. Gordon Conferences; eight U.S.  educators and seven Taiwan educators
              will present lectures.  Twenty college chemistry  educators and students from
              the  U.S. will be invited to attend.    Innovation in undergraduate education
              in chemistry is an  important topic in the development of  human resources in 
              science and international research infrastructures.    This  topic is
              particularly opportune, since chemistry education  in Taiwan has been
              undergoing a major change.  The Ministry  of Education has spent a billion
              dollars remodeling the  chemistry laboratories at 20 universities during the
              last  ten years.  The experience gained from this renovation will  be useful to
              share with chemistry educators in the U.S. The  meeting will be held at the
              University of California at San  Diego on December 15-18, 1996 and is jointly
              supported by  the Taiwan National Science Council and the NSF.
