Abstract    :
              9600433  Gaffney  This grant will provide partial support for the XVIIth
              International Conference on Magnetic Resonance in Biological Systems (ICMRBS),
              to be held in Keystone Colorado, August 18-23, 1996.    The meeting will focus
              on a broad range of magnetic resonance methods as applied to studies of
              biological processes.  This biennial meeting has become the major venue for
              discussion of advances in NMR studies of the high resolution structure and
              dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids and of the role of magnetic resonance
              (both NMR and EPR) in structural biology.  NMR studies of protein structure
              often rival those by x-ray crystallography, but NMR also provides unique
              information on the dynamics of macromolecules - an area that will be emphasized
              in the scientific program.  In vivo NMR spectroscopic and imaging results to be
              presented will shed light on metabolic processes and on their cellular
              ramifications.  Other sessions will cover new magnetic resonance methods,
              advances in magnet design, and improvements in instrumentation for spectroscopy
              and imaging.  Considerable effort has been made to plan symposia in such a way
              as to stimulate cross-fertilization of ideas among the communities expert in
              high resolution NMR, solid state NMR, EPR, in vivo spectroscopy and magnetic
              resonance imaging.  The conference is built around 12 plenary lectures and 27
              parallel sessions with a total of 81 invited talks and 27 short contributions
              selected from poster abstracts.  Three poster sessions of up to 200 posters
              each round out the program.    The funds provided by NSF will provide partial
              support for travel of 75 younger scientists (graduate students, postdoctorals,
              beginning faculty).  Funds are also being sought from industry and other
              government agencies.  By permitting more younger scientists to attend, the
              grant will be particularly beneficial in promoting the active participation of
              female and, to some extent, minority investigators, who tend to be
              disproportionately represented in the younger gro up.  %%%
