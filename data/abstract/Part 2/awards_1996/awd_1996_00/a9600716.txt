Abstract    :
              9600716  Eliseev    This Americas Program award will support cooperative 
              research between Dr.  Alexey V. Eliseev of the State University of NY, Buffalo,
               and Dr. Anatoly Yatsimirski  of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico
              (UNAM).  The  investigators  intend to work on two approaches to the creation
              of new  molecular receptors and  host-guest systems based on the search for
              potential  molecular hosts among  compounds generated during chemical
              self-organization and  natural evolution, as  opposed to the designed synthesis
              of these compounds.    This joint effort will involve the complementary skills
              of  two research groups and  the shared use of facilities.  The results of this
               collaboration may lead to finding new  examples of supramolecular systems and
              discovering new  properties of naturally  occurring compounds.  ***
