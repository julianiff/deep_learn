Abstract    :
              9600108.  HAIRSTON   Organisms have a wide range of adaptations to life in a
              changing environment.  Among fish, jaw morphology  is often related to diet,
              which varies between seasons and populations.  Linking environmental variation
              with morphological variation can provide insights into the causes of character
              variation observed in nature. In research funded by this award, killifish
              (Cyprinodon variegatus) populations  on mangrove islands in Florida Bay will be
              studied to assess the ways in which temporal and spatial variation in diet
              produce and maintain differences in jaw shape and size.   Environmental
              variation in food resources and food utilization by populations of killifish
              inhabiting two distinct habitats (bay and island pools) will be documented.
              Variation in feeding morphology among  these populations will then be assayed
              to elucidate the environmental and genetic contributions to morphological
              variation. In a related study,  the developmental basis of diet-specific
              feeding efficiency  will be assessed.  The research will shed light on a
              longstanding issue in population biology, how morphological variation is
              produced and maintained in a changing environment.  Because such variation
              provides the fuel for species to cope with environmental change, the research
              has implications for conservation biology and habitat management.
