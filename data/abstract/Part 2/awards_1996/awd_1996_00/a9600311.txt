Abstract    :
              9600311  McFadden      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour  months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit for Dr. Christopher F. McFadden to work with
              Professor  Nicholas D. Spencer at the Swiss Federal Institute of  Technology in
              Zurich, Switzerland.        This project will focus on investigating the
              ability of  chiral adsorbed organic species to provoke the formation of  screw
              dislocations in a metal overlayer.  The objective is  to characterize via
              various surface spectroscopies, the  structure of metals deposited onto chiral
              organic  substrates.  The hope is to produce heterogeneous catalysis  materials
              selective for the synthesis of chiral molecules.  ***
