Abstract    :
              Clive W. Granger  University of California - San Diego  SBR-9600674   
              Forecasting is a widely used tool in policy analysis.  The P.I.  will apply
              recent developments in nonlinear time-series models to  improve forecasting
              models.  Among the areas to be investigated  include error-correction models
              and duration models.  Error-  correction models will be generalized to include
              nonlinear forms.   Duration models, which relate to the time period "news" has 
              effect on a market, will be investigated to determine their  relevance for
              forecasting.
