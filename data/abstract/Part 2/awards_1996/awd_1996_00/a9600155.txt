Abstract    :
                   Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will  focus on the
              recently discovered top quark and on the `Higgs`  particle predicted to exist
              as part of the mechanism which may  explain the origin of mass.  Analyses will
              be done which will  make it possible to determine the properties of the top
              quark  (especially its mass) from experimental studies despite the  complex
              relation between these properties and the experimental  observations.  Analyses
              facilitating the determination of the  properties of the Higgs particle from
              future experiments will be  done as well.  Learning the properties of the top
              quark and of  the Higgs particle is centrally important to our learning more 
              about the nature of the elementary particles and their  interactions, and about
              the origin of mass.       The project will also have an educational component
              in which  an effort will be made to make physics more accessible to 
              introductory students.  An effort will also be made to increase  the
              participation of women in physics by providing teaching  internships for
              undergraduate women, and by the principal  investigator serving as a role model
              for women.
