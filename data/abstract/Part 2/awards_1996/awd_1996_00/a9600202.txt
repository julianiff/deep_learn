Abstract    :
              Research will be carried out in experimental nuclear physics  and new tools will
              be developed for teaching nuclear physics  at the graduate level.  The central
              research activity is a  series of experiments designed to elucidate nuclear 
              structure contributions to weak interaction processes in  complex systems.  The
              decays of unstable nuclei are driven  principally by the weak interaction.  The
              proposed  measurements are very precise in nature and will address  small
              effects which limit our detailed understanding of the  weak interaction. 
              Specifically, measurements will be  carried out aimed at improving the
              understanding of the rare  double beta decay process, of isospin symmetry
              breaking and  the complexities it introduces in extracting the weak 
              interaction strength using weak probes or hadronic probes,  of possible effects
              of meson exchange currents on weak  interaction strengths, and of possible
              small scalar parts of  the weak interaction (which is predominantly
              vector/pseudo-  vector in nature).  Integration of education and research is 
              an equally important facet of the proposed activity.  The  experiments will be
              carried out at the Notre Dame tandem Van  de Graaff, and at several particle
              accelerators in Europe.  Graduate and undergraduate students will work on all
              aspects  of the proposed research to broaden their research training  and
              develop their research skills.  Relating explicitly to  the teaching part of
              this PI's overall academic activity, a  new set of problems in nuclear physics
              will be developed  which will provide a more contemporary basis for teaching 
              nuclear physics at the graduate level.
