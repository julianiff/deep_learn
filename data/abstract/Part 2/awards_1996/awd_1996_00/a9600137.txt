Abstract    :
              9600137  Xin     The PI proposes to study a class of nonlinear partial
              differential   equations arising from Continuum Mechanics and other branches of
              natural   sciences, which includes the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations for
              both   compressible and incompressible, inviscid and viscous fluids, the
              equations   of electro-magneto field dynamics for electrically conducting
              compressible   viscous fluids, the equations of elasticity, nonlinear Boltzmann
              type   equations in kinetic theory, and equations for combustion, multi-phase  
              flows, etc. The main goal is to gain understanding of the dynamics and  
              interactions of basic nonlinear waves such as shock waves, expansion waves,  
              solitons, diffusive waves, vortex sheets, and boundary layers, which play  
              important roles in the study of the general flows. In particular, it is  
              proposed to analyze the effects of the small scale dissipation or relaxation  
              processes on large scale physical quantities and their motions. Other  
              questions such as global existence of both strong and weak solutions,  
              nonlinear stability of basic wave patterns, uniqueness of weak entropy  
              solutions, layer behavior of solutions, numerical methods for the computation  
              of discontinuous flows, and fluid-dynamic limit for kinetic models are also  
              to be explored. It is planned to continue the current effort to expand the  
              existing techniques and to develop new tools for studying some of these  
              problems. One of the main idea is to refine the conventional methods designed  
              to study smooth flows or unrelaxed systems by taking into account more  
              internal structures of the underlying discontinuous flows, and study these  
              problems both theoretically and numerically.    %%%   Nonlinear evolution of
              partial differential equations arising from   physical balance laws govern many
              of the most widely encountered phenomena in   nature. Solutions to these
              nonlinear systems remain a central topic in the   study of wave propagations
              and are fundamental to the understanding of basic    physical phenomena ranging
              from compressible and incompressible fluids,   acoustic waves and
              electromagnetic scattering to wave propagations in   nonlinear composite
              materials, in reactive gas mixtures, in fiber optics,  as well as in
              magnetohydrodynamics and general relativity. In this project,   It is proposed
              to study some of the basic questions for these nonlinear   systems, which are
              motivated directly by important applications to many fields   such as image
              processing, aeronautics, composite material, sonar, radar,   medical imaging,
              geophysical exploration, weather prediction, oil reservoir   simulations etc..
              For example, the proposed study of design of high resolution  
              multi-dimensional numerical methods for calculating sharp fronts for mixed  
              type partial differential equations is extremely important for the oil  
              reservoir simulations, design of composite materials, imaging processing,   and
              propagation of pollutants such as oil in water and air; the proposed   study of
              boundary layer theory is one of the key ingredients in the   understanding of
              turbulence, and the design of supersonic aircrafts, etc..   Thus the
              accomplishment of this project should be of considerable importance   in the
              improvement and new development of technologies in the above mentioned  
              fields.  ***
