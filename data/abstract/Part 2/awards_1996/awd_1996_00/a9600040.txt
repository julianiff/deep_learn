Abstract    :
                This project will develop and implement procedures that will enhance
              communication between investigators who report results and their audience
              (i.e., other investigators, decision makers, and students).  These
              user-friendly procedures will enable clients to alter investigators' priors,
              examine alternative posterior moments, and combine models.  Software will be
              developed with standard file structures to facilitate control between it and
              user software.  This software will enable clients to evaluate the accuracy of
              reweighted output, plot corresponding posterior densities, and average across
              models to obtain posterior moments unconditional on models.  It is expected
              that this project will have two significant impacts in the social sciences. 
              First, it will place within the reach of all quantitative social scientists
              many of the inherent advantages of Bayesian analysis by removing the
              unreasonable computational demands that have previously been required.  Second,
              it will enable clients to rework investigators' analyses by modifying their
              priors, examining alternative posterior moments, and updating samples, in less
              time than is required to read a typical research report.  Together these
              impacts should greatly encourage analysis of the robustness of policy
              recommendations with respect to assumptions and accelerate the application of
              new research to policy problems.
