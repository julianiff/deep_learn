Abstract    :
              9600346  Marr      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-  four months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions.    This award will support a twenty-four month
              postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Kendrick L. Marr (under the  sponsorship of
              Dr. Richard I. Ford) of the University of  Michigan to work with Professor Pei
              Sheng-Ji at Kunming  Institute of Botany in Yunnan, China.  Funding for this 
              project is being provided by the U.S.-China Program.        The purpose of this
              project is to investigate the  ethnobotany, domestication and genetic
              variability of  Momordica charantia L. (bitter-melon) and various other 
              species such as the wax gourd and the loofa.  The edible  fruit are harvested
              from the wild, swidden farms, or home  gardens, by the Xishuangbanna people. 
              These species belong  to the Cucurbitaceae (Squash family), one of the most 
              important plant families in China for fresh vegetables as  well as medicinal
              plants.  The luffa and bitter-melon are  important because they have a thick
              wax coating which  protects them during the hot summer months and allows them 
              to be stored for up to a year and a half.  Documentation of  indigenous
              knowledge of crop plant varieties is important  not only to maintain genetic
              diversity, but because this  knowledge encourages rational regional development
              policies  in rural areas.    ***
