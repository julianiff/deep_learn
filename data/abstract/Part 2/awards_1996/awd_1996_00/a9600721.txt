Abstract    :
              This award supports the research of a cultural anthropologist studying the
              process of women's aging in the Middle East.  The aim of the project is to
              measure the prevalence and determinants of menopausal symptoms, and to
              investigate patterns of health care use among women in Casablanca, Morocco and
              Beirut, Lebanon.  The perceptions and meanings of menopause among women and
              health professionals will be studied as well as government policies which
              affect the definition and management of the condition in the two countries. 
              Methods will include in depth interviews with a sample of women to design an
              appropriate survey questionnaire, which will be administered to a random sample
              of 300 women in each country.  The aim will be to measure the discomfort and
              incapacitation experienced by the women as well as the factors which influence
              the symptoms, their reasons for seeking both biomedical and traditional health
              care, as well as their general notions of reproduction, aging, and health. 
              Interviews and observations will also be carried out in doctors' offices.  This
              research is important because it will advance our understanding of this
              condition of aging which affects an increasing proportion of society's
              population given the fact that people in many societies are living longer.  The
              regional comparison will suggest rich hypotheses for studying what part of
              menopause is culturally conditioned and what part biologically given.  The
              study seeks to understand the multiple meanings of menopause, explore the
              forces that shape the extent to which it is medicalized, and gain insight into
              underlying ideas about health, gender and aging across these two societies and
              ultimately, to advance theory covering the world's population.
