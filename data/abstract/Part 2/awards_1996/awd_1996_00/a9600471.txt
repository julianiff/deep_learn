Abstract    :
              This award supports the participation of ten U.S. graduate students and recent
              PhD's in an Trans-Atlantic mathematics workshop to be held in Pontresina,
              Switzerland, in June 1996.  The workshop is co-organized by Professor Diane
              O'Leary of the University of Maryland and local host organizers Walter Gander
              and Martin Gutknecht of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich,
              with the assistance of a program committee comprised of several other European,
              US and Canadian experts.  The topic of the meeting is recent advances in
              numerical algebra, with particular attention to applications in signal
              processing and control, parallel computation, image processing and various
              industrial problems.    The purpose of the meeting is to bring together some of
              the world's most active researchers in the theoretical as well as applied
              aspects of numerical algebra, together with promising newcomers, in order to
              foster close personal interaction and exchange of ideas at the leading edge of
              the field.  Graduate students will be included among those invited to talk
              about their work.  Meeting organizers emphasize the creation of an informal
              atmosphere in an isolated location in order to facilitate small group and
              personal discussions among the participants.  Ensuring the participation of
              promising junior US researchers in this dynamic field through this NSF award
              will enable them to establish personal contact with leading minds in the field
              outside of the US, and gain international contacts that should prove to be
              professionally valuable in their careers.
