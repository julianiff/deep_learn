Abstract    :
                     This is a project submitted under Small Grants for Exploratory Research
              (SGER).  It is designed to obtain public opinion data prior to the 1995 Russian
              legislative election during a period of rapid social change in Russia and the
              potential emergence of new obstacles to democratization. The research will make
              significant substantive and theoretical contributions to our understanding of
              how major social changes, including the creation of new institutions, lead to
              social dislocations and rising tensions related to regional, urban/rural, and
              ethnic and religious cleavages.  It is a follow-up of a survey conducted around
              the 1993 election, enabling the researchers to measure changing public
              perceptions and levels of discontent.  Analysis is based on a national survey
              of 4,000 respondents.  %%%   This research will contribute to sociological
              understanding of the process of democratization and its effects on diverse
              population groups.  An examination of public reactions to rapid social changes
              and to the opportunities for expressing political choices will demonstrate the
              ways in which the Russian situation is similar or different from that of other
              countries undergoing a transition to democracy.  In addition to the scientific
              gains from this research, the project will encourage scientific ties with
              researchers in Russia.
