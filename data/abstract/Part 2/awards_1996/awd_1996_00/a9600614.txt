Abstract    :
              9600614  Becker    Recent research on human cognition suggests that students'
              conceptual  understanding of a subject does not occur by reception of
              information and explanations but through a "construction of meaning" that comes
              from a thoughtful reconciling of new information and prior beliefs.    This
              research project examines to what extent beliefs and teaching practices
              consistent with constructivist theory are both affecting and, in turn, being
              affected by the availability of new computer technologies in schools,,
              including CD-ROM databases, hypertext and multimedia authoring environments,
              worldwide digital communications, desktop publishing software, and laboratory
              instrument probes.  Specifically, the project will...    * determine the
              prevalence of different uses of computer technology by teachers and their
              students;  * determine the prevalence of constructivist perspectives and
              constructivist-compatible instructional practices among those teachers;  *
              determine the relationship between the extent and types of teachers' computer
              use and their instructional beliefs and practices;  * specify the differences
              in school contexts and personal backgrounds between technology-using teachers
              with a constructivist perspective and other teachers-including those who teach 
              with an understanding of constructivism, but without technology supports,  and
              those who use technology but without a constructivist approach;  * specify the
              temporal order between changes in teachers' orientation towards constructivist
              goals and methods and changes in their use of technology, and  * develop and
              validate methods for using self-report survey instruments to investigate
              teacher beliefs and practices.    The above purposes will be addressed through
              a national survey of elementary and secondary teachers in mathematics, science,
              social studies, and other subjects.  The survey includes a national probability
              sample of 900 schools and more than 3,100 teachers and two targeted samples of 
              schools and their teachers-210 high- end technology-using schools and 210
              schools that are known for their involvement in educational reform activities.
              Including some teachers included through principal nomination, approximately
              4,000 teacher surveys are expected to be completed. A separate validation
              sub-study will be conducted with 92 teachers from 23 schools in which survey
              responses are compared with extensive classroom observation and personal
              interviews with the teachers.    If we are to know the value of computer
              technology for accomplishing instructional reform, it is not sufficient to know
              whether carefully designed computer-based activities can result in
              constructivist teaching in carefully monitored settings taught by exemplary
              technology-using teachers. It is equally important to document to what extent
              current technologies are being exploited by constructivist-oriented teachers
              operating in more typical circumstances and to learn how much those
              technologies are helping those teachers change how they teach.  ***
