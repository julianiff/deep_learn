Abstract    :
                      Abstract  9600390  Storm      The  Gordon Research Conferences are held
              every summer to discuss  recent findings and current thinking in various areas
              of science.  Although participation is limited, the attendees usually  consist 
              of  established  scientists, young investigators who  are  making  important 
              contributions  in  these  areas,  and  post   doctoral  fellows.  They  are 
              usually held in small isolated  New  England  towns away from other
              distractions and are conducive to the  free  exchange of ideas. These
              conferences have a recognized value  for  presenting  the  latest advances in
              research and also  indicating  the future trends which are likely to be most
              productive.    ***
