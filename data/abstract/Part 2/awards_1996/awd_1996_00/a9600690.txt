Abstract    :
              This project investigates epidemiological, hormonal, demographic, and cultural
              variables  pertaining to pregnancy-related sickness in rural Bangladeshi women.
               Data were collected from  a prospective reproductive survey of 708 women in
              Bangladesh in 1993.  Twice weekly  interviews and urine specimens collected
              across gestation from 203 pregnant women will be  used to 1) examine the
              prevalence, maternal age pattern, and gestational timing of  pregnancy-related
              sickness: 2) determine the relationship between hormone profiles (estrogen, 
              progesterone, and human chorionic gonadotropin) and the presence/absence and
              gestational  timing of pregnancy-related sickness: and 3) determine the
              relationship of pregnancy outcome  (live birth vs. miscarriage) with
              pregnancy-related sickness, while simultaneously controlling for  the effects
              of maternal age, hormone profiles, and parity.  Immunoassays will be used to
              quantify  hormonal concentrations across gestation.  Descriptive statistics and
              event history analysis will  be used to examine the relationships among
              pregnancy-related sickness and the variables  discussed above.  This work will
              be used to evaluate hypotheses on the etiologic, ecological and  evolutionary
              bases of pregnancy-related sickness.
