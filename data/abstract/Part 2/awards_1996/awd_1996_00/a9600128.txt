Abstract    :
              DMS-9600128  McLaughlin    The proposer continues his research in the theory and
              application of  nonlinear dispersive waves, in the specific areas of chaotic
              nonlinear  waves, waves which occur in the interaction of the atmosphere with
              the  ocean, and topics in liquid crystal nonlinear optics.  His work on the 
              mathematical theory of chaotic nonlinear waves will focus upon the  persistence
              and consequences of homoclinic orbits for partial differ-  ential equations. 
              In the project he develops geometric singular  perturbation methods for partial
              differential equations, including  including invariant manifold fibrations and
              normal forms.  He then  combines these methods from dynamical systems theory
              with Melnikov  analysis to prove the persistence of homoclinic orbits. 
              Consequences  of these orbits for  nonlinear wave systems are then investigated
               numerically.  Such modern methods in the mathematical theory of  nonlinear
              dispersive waves are  applied to topics in atmosphere ocean  physics and  to
              nonlinear optics.  %%%  Atmosphere ocean interactions and laser propagation in 
              nonlinear optics  are two of the  most natural areas in science for the
              occurence of  nonlinear dispersive waves.  The proposer will develop modern
              mathe-  matical theory of these waves, and apply it to these areas of science. 
              Chaotic and irregular behavior, which occurs in the temporal evolution of 
              these nonlinear wave systems, is just becoming understood mathematically.  The
              proposer will study the effects of such nonlinear and irregular  behavior on
              oscillations  of the sea surface temperature, on the  prediction and evolution
              of storm tracks, and on the propagation of laser  light through liquid crystal
              materials.  Methods for this scientific  study include mathematical theory,
              formal perturbation theory, and  scientific computation.    ***
