Abstract    :
                This three-year award supports U.S.-United Kingdom cooperative research in
              software programming languages between J. Eliot Moss of the University of
              Massachusetts and Ron Morrison of the University of St. Andrews in Fife, United
              Kingdom.  The objective of their research is to extend main object space
              algorithms for use in collecting persistent object databases.  This so-called
              garbage collection scheme will locate, and organize for reuse, memory
              containing data which is no longer accessible in databases.    The project
              brings together two compatible and complementary research groups in persistence
              research.  The algorithm extensions will be designed jointly, and then
              implemented, evaluated and integrated into each team's existing database
              systems. The project will advance our understanding of the management of huge
              amounts of data in object databases.
