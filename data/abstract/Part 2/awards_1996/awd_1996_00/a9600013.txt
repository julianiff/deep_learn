Abstract    :
                This two-year award will support dissertation research on the effects of
              elevated atmospheric CO2  on native ecosystems by Cara Hinkson at San Diego
              State University in cooperation with Dr. Franco Miglietta at the CNR Institute
              of Agrometeorology and Environmental Analysis for Agriculture in Florence,
              Italy.  The main objective of the research is to determine the effects of
              elevated CO2 on the plant-soil-microbe nutrient dynamics and carbon allocation
              patterns, and to determine how these factors collectively affect native forest
              productivity.  The dissertation project will take place in a native coppiced
              mixed-oak forest community in Tuscany, Italy, where a natural CO2 spring has
              enriched CO2 concentrations for several hundreds to thousands of years.   CO2
              springs provide an opportunity to compare effects from naturally enriched
              communities to those from previous short-term manipulations using seedlings 
              and saplings in controlled environments and to observe changes over different
              times scales and spatial scales.  The research will benefit from the work of
              the Italian institute on Italian CO2 springs and from the Principal
              Investigator's work on the effects of elevated CO2 and climate change on
              Mediterranean-type ecosystems in such areas as California, South Africa,
              Australia, Chile, and the Mediterranean Basin.
