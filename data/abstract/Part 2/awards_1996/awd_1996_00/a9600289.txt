Abstract    :
              9600289  Kirkpatrick      The International Research Fellow Awards Program
              enables  U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour  months
              of research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twenty-four-month
              postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. R. Craig Kirkpatrick to work with 
              Professor Ren Renmei at Beijing University.      Dr. Kirkpatrick and Dr. Renmei
              will investigate changes in  the group size of a Sichuan snub-nosed monkey, 
              (Rhinopithecus roxellana), in relation to seasonal use of  food resources. 
              They will document these changes by  systematic, direct observation.  Data from
              vegetation  transects, phenology plots, and nutritional assays will be 
              combined to estimate food patch size and quality across food  species. These
              data will provide direct tests of hypotheses  derived from ecological theory
              that relates group size to  food characters.  An advantage of this study is
              that the  same animals will be used in different environments, with  seasonal
              change providing a natural experiment.    ***
