Abstract    :
              9600360  Blaumueller      The International Research Fellow Awards Program
              enables  U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour  months
              of research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit which will support Dr. Christine M. Blaumueller to
               work with Dr. Marek Mlodzik at the European Molecular  Biology Laboratory, in
              Heidelberg, Germany.    Dr. Blaumueller's project is to identify targets of the
              AP-1  transciption complex by: 1) Performing a preliminary genetic  screen for
              modifiers of a phenotype produced by the  expression of a constitutively
              activated Jun mutant in  Drosophilia photoreceptor recursors, 2) Characterizing
               mutant phenotypes/genetic interactions of these modifiers,  3) Genetically and
              molecularly mapping modifier genes, and  molecularly cloning the most
              interesting of these genes, and  4) Characterizing any molecular/biochemical
              interactions  between modifier genes and Jun.  ***
