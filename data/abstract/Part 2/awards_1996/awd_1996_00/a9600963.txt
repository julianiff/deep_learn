Abstract    :
              9600963  McLane    The details of how specific molecules imbedded in nerve cell 
              membranes (molecular receptors) mediate the signaling of  nervous systems are
              still not fully understood.  One  particular molecule, the nicotinic
              acetylcholine receptor  mediates neurotransmission in skeletal muscle, in the 
              autonomic nervous system, and in many areas of the brain.  It is known that
              there are many different nicotinic  acetylcholine receptor subtypes in the
              brain, but their  function remains elusive because subtype-specific probes are 
              not available.  The goal of the research project funded by  this grant is to
              isolate artificial, subtype-specific  peptide toxins that can be used to study
              the function of  different nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes. These 
              peptides will be selected from random peptide libraries  using phage display
              technology.  This new technology allows  the simultaneous selection of peptides
              that are displayed on  the surface of bacteriophage particles, which also
              contain  the DNA encoding the peptide sequence.  Peptides displayed  on phage
              will be selected for binding to nicotinic receptor  subtype-specific sequences.
               In addition, this grant helps  support a new laboratory course in molecular
              neurobiology.    The research funded by this grant is expected to provide 
              important insights into the molecular function of neurons  and to lead to new
              tools for further research into the  molecular biology of neuronal receptors. 
              The laboratory  course to be developed under this grant is expected to  provide
              a novel approach to teaching molecular neurobiology.
