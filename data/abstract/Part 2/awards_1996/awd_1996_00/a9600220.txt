Abstract    :
              9600220  Lawson    This U.S.-Brazil workshop will bring together an array of 
              leading American and Brazilian geometers.  The workshop, to  be held at IMPA in
              Rio de Janeiro from July 8 to 19 will  provide an intensive working period with
              presentations of  current results, problem sessions, and  periods for informal 
              discussions.  Led by Blaine Lawson of SUNY Stony Brook and  Manfred do Carmo of
              the Institute of Pure and Applied  Mathematics (IMPA) in Rio de Janeiro, the
              workshop will  include topics in minimal submanifolds and hypersurfaces of 
              constant mean curvature, global theory of minimal surfaces  in Euclidean space,
              Gauge field theory, and isometric  immersions.    IMPA has a world reputation
              as a center of mathematical  research, and the invited Brazilian participants
              have all  made significant contributions to the areas or research to  be
              represented in the workshop.  From the contacts in the  workshop should issue
              new collaborations in the area of  geometry which can significantly impact the
              field.    ****
