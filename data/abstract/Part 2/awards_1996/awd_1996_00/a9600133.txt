Abstract    :
              9600133  Brenner       In the application of finite element methods to problems
              in  computational mechanics, difficulties such as the phenomenon of  locking,
              the incompressibility constraint, cracked domains and  higher order equations
              are encountered.  By combining the  techniques of nonconforming elements, macro
              elements, singular  functions and mixed formulations, robust finite element
              methods  that employ relatively few numbers of unknowns can be developed  to
              overcome these difficulties.  The  investigator develops  multigrid and domain
              decomposition algorithms for such finite  element methods.       Multigrid
              algorithms compute the solutions of systems of  equations at a cost
              proportional to the number of unknowns and  therefore are the most efficient
              methods for solving large  systems.  Domain decomposition algorithms distribute
              the  computation over different parts of the physical domain and hence  are
              very suitable for parallel computers.  They are currently two  of the major
              ideas in high performance computing.  The results  from this project can lead
              to fast solvers for problems in  elasticity, plasticity, plates, beams, shells,
              and fluid  mechanics.  In particular, a new multigrid method is developed for 
              the computation of stress intensity factors, which are important  quantities in
              the study of the macroscopic phenomena of materials  such as fatigues and
              fractures.  These problems arise in the  design of structures such as
              buildings, bridges, planes, and  ships, and in the analysis of how structures
              perform.  Hence the  project provides tools for solving problems of
              manufacturing and  of monitoring and renewing civil infrastructure.
