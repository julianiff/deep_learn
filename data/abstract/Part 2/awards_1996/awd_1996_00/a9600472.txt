Abstract    :
                9600472  Chien        A new international collaborative research program on
              the  magnetic properties of nanostuctured materials between the  Johns Hopkins
              University and Nanjing University  in China is proposed.  The studies include
              both the magneto-  optical effect (Kerr and Faraday effects) and giant magneto-
               transport properties on three classes of nanostructured  materials:
              multilayers, arrays of nanowires,and granular  solids, which are exciting
              fields of fundamental and  technological importance.  In parallel to this
              proposal, the  Chinese scientists are also submitting a proposal to the 
              National Natural Science Foundation of China for their  portions of the
              research expenses.    Nanostructured materials allow many possibilities for 
              probing fundamental physical interactions.  Future advances  in use of such
              materials will be important in rapidly  expanding industrial sectors such as
              data recording or  sensors.
