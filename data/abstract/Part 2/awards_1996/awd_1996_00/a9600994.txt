Abstract    :
                This award to the University of Wisconsin supports the research of a cultural
              anthropologist studying an indigenous Andean form of historical record-keeping.
               In pre-Hispanic times the Andean peoples recorded information through the
              medium of knotted cords, called khipus.  The investigator has discovered a
              remote highland community of Quechua Indians who still maintain a set of
              khipus, which they use as ceremonial objects displayed in order to validate
              possession of local political office. The investigator has conducted
              ethnographic research on usage and has photographed these objects,  and will
              analyze the internal structure of the knots, comparing them to other similar
              objects; computerize the data, perform radio-carbon tests to establish the age
              of the objects, and carry out numerical and statistical analysis by experts.  
              This research will document a unique and endangered dataset for Andean studies
              and for the social science of numbers and record-keeping.  By studying how
              present day people use this sort of object to record important information, the
              study can help shed light on the pre-Hispanic patterns of use and advance our
              understanding of indigenous, pre-literate record-keeping systems.  The new
              knowledge to be generated from this project could help shed light on the
              meaning of similar archaeologically recorded speciments.
