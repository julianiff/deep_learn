Abstract    :
              9600046  Sanders    This U.S.-Brazil collaborative research project will study 
              the time duration of highly deformed configurations of  lighter nuclei that are
              formed in heavy-ion fusion  reactions.  Together with Alejandro Szanto de
              Toledo of the  Nuclear Physics Department of the Universidade de Sao Paulo, 
              the PI's, Stephen Sanders and Francis Prosser at the  University of Kansas, 
              will use the Pelletron at Sao Paulo  and the Argonne National Laboratory ATLAS
              facilities to  perform an extended series of sensitive tests to deduce 
              compound nucleus lifetimes from the fluctuation measurements  of fission
              fragments. Fine-step excitation functions of  these fission yields will be
              obtained to evaluate the  autocorrelation function. It is expected that the 
              measurements will be effective for lifetimes between 7x10^-  22 sec and
              7x10^-21 sec.    The projected series of tests will make excellent use of the 
              lower-energy facilities in Sao Paulo, where more beam time  is available than
              would be possible in the US labs.  Higher energy experiments will be carried
              out at Argonne  in the US.  The proposed work forms a coherent collection  of
              experiments in an area where little data is available  and capitalizes on the
              expertise and facilities of the  two countries. A graduate student will also
              travel to Sao  Paulo to participate in the work.    ***
