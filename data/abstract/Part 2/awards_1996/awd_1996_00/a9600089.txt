Abstract    :
              Kleiman  Kovacs  9600089    This awards supports the research of Dr. S. Kovacs
              as a  post-doctoral associate of Professor S. Kleiman to work on  problems in
              complex algebraic geometry. He hopes to find a  construction for the relative
              De Rham complex for non-smooth  morphisms. He also hopes to study log flips of
              complex varieties  and to try to confirm Kollar's conjecture that certain
              Abelian  surfaces blown-up at a single point give cones which decompose  into
              non-trivial finitely generated part and a non-trivial  nowhere locally finitely
              generated part.     This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of
              the  oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to  the point
              where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems  that have stood for
              centuries. Originally, it treated figures  defined in the plane by the simplest
              of equations, namely  polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from
              algebra,  but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is 
              extensively used in those fields.  Moreover it has proved itself  useful in
              fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer  science, cryptography,
              coding theory and robotics.
