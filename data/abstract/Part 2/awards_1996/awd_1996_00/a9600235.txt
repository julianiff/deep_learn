Abstract    :
              9600235  Ehrlich      This proposal is a request for funds for a conference on 
              "Calcium and Cell Function", to be held this summer.  It will  focus on the
              biochemistry, molecular biology,  structure/function, and physiology of calcium
              as a molecule  that affects all primary biological cellular activities.  This 
              meeting will bring together a diverse group of scientists  working an all
              phases of calcium and its role in cell  function.  This is a long standing
              conference focusing  entirely on calcium and covers the sprectrum of calcium 
              research.  The format and location of the meeting encourage  discussion and
              interaction among the participants and the  meeting will serve as a stimulus to
              future research.    ***
