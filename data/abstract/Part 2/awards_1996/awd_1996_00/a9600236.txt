Abstract    :
              9600236  Roberts      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour  months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit which will support Dr. Matthew A. Roberts to work
              with  Dr. Hubert Girault at the Ecole Polytechnique Federal de  Lausanne in
              Switzerland.        The objective of this project is to 1) produce a 
              microfabricated liquid handling device with an  interdigitated array (IDA)
              electrochemical (EC) detection  cell and 2) to utilize IDAs for EC detection of
              immunoassays  within the proposed microfabricated liquid handling device.  The
              production of this miniaturized chemical analysis system  device will be able
              to monitor environmental pollutants in a  truly field-portable fashion.
              Analysis times of less than  five minutes are expected which could be used for
              the rapid  analysis of priority pollutants and quick mapping of  contaminant
              mobility at remediation sites.  This technology  will help reduce
              characterization and overall remediation  costs at sites associated with
              national Superfund programs  due to these advantages.  ***
