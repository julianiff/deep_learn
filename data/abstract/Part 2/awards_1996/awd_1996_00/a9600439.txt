Abstract    :
              96004339  Snyder  The program will consist of nine scientific platform sessions,
              one keynote address, one Methods and Technologies workshop and two poster
              sessions.  The scientific sessions will cover nuclear architecture, DNA
              replication (origins and biochemistry), cell cycle control, telomeres and
              position effects, centromeres and their interacting proteins, components of the
              mitotic spindle apparatus, microtubule motors and meiotic chromosome
              segregation.  Six or seven speakers will present talks in each session for a
              total of 65 talks.  The  workshop will cover recent technologies in yeast
              chromosome and genome research (e.g. use and analysis of GFP fusions, creating
              mutations and epitope tagging yeast genes by PCR, fine structure electron
              microscopic analysis of the mitotic spindle apparatus, accessing yeast genome
              information).  The poster sessions will cover all areas of yeast chromosome
              research.  Finally, ample time will be available in the afternoons and after
              the evening sessions to allow extensive discussion among researchers.  ***
