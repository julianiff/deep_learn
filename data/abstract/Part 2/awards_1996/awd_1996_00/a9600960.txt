Abstract    :
              9600960  Dawson  This award renews support of a collection of deer mice 
              (Peromyscus) used by government and academic researchers  across the US.  The
              collection includes 6 species and about 30  mutants and inbred lines. 
              Peromyscus is important in a  diverse set of areas of biological research,
              including  ecology, animal behavior, and  population biology.  Because  the
              deer mouse is the usual host for the hantavirus in nature,  the collection has
              been of significant use for research into  human transmission of the virus
              since the Four Corners  outbreak in 1993. The virus has become common in wild 
              populations of Peromyscus, and use of the collection  has  increased as this
              threat to human health posed by the use of  wild-caught animals has become
              appreciated.
