Abstract    :
              ***  9600400  Goldberg  Support will continue for a broad-ranging research
              program  at the Santa Fe Institute.  The focus of the research is the  study of
              complex adaptive systems in different areas of  science, ranging over the
              biological, social, physical,  mathematical, and computational sciences. 
              Researcher from a  number of institutions and areas of study will conduct 
              collaborative research both at the Santa Fe Institute and at  their home
              institutions.  In addition, partial support will  be provided for the annual
              Complex Systems Summer School.  ***
