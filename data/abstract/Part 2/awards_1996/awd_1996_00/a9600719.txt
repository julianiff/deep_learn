              9600719  McLerran       This grant award covers expenses incidental to the 
              participation of young scientists in the Moriond Conference  no XXXI in Les
              Arcs, Savoie, France.  The annual Moriond  assemblies provide an opportunity
              for close interaction  among physicists who share interests in different
              aspects of  particle physics.  The sessions are organized around  presentations
              for one week in Electroweak Theory and Unified  Theories one week in QCD and
              High Energy Hadronic  Interactions.  ***
