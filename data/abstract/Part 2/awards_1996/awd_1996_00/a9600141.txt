Abstract    :
              Abstract  Wu    The principle investigator proposes to study two problems: one
              is a generalized "homogenization" problem; another is the two dimensional water
              wave and Euler equations.  Homogenization is an effective method used to study
              the micro-structure   of materials. The mathematical method used to tackle the
              problem is the weak convergence method; 2-D Euler equations and 2-D gravity
              waves arise in the naval study and applied physics. The objective of the
              proposed works is to continue the line of research initiated by Coifman, Lions,
              Meyer and Semmes; and Tartar and Murat, and many others, to understand the link
              between weak continuity, cancelation property and Hardy spaces for multilinear
              operators and nonlinear operators, to find sufficient   conditions for the weak
              continuity of nonlinear operators; and to continue the work of Nalimov,
              Yosihara and  Walter Craig and solve the existence and uniqueness problem for
              2-D water waves.     The long term objective of the proposed works is to
              develop more machinery on the weak convergence of nonlinear operators and to
              apply the result and methods to solve open problems in nonlinear partial
              differential equations and applied sciences; and to develop a complete
              understanding of the motion of water waves, both two dimensional and three  
              dimensional, and to develop a method which could be used in the study of other
              areas in the mathematical theory of fluid dynamics.  The methods to be used are
              from harmonic analysis, complex analysis, the theory of nonlinear partial
              differential equations.
