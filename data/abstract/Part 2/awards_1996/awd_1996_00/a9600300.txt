Abstract    :
              9600300  Normark      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour  months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Benjamin Normark to work with Dr. Roger L. 
              Blackman at the Natural History Museum in London, England.        Dr. Normark
              and Dr. Blackman will conduct a program of  research into the molecular and
              genomic evolution of  obligately parthenogenetica aphids, focusing on the tribe
               Tramini.  This work will build on Dr. Normark's ongoing  research into the
              molecular evolution of the aphid tribe  Tramini and on Dr. Blackman's ongoing
              cytogenetic research  into Tramini and other aphids.  A central goal will be to
               synthesize molecular-biological and cytogenetic techniques  to progress
              towards an integrated view of the evolution of  aphid genomes in the absence of
              sexuality.  They will focus  on the Trama troglodytes complex and on the tribe
              Tramini of  which it is part.  ***
