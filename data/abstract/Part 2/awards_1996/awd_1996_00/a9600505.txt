Abstract    :
                        INT-9600505  Schilling    This U.S.-Polish Cooperative Research award
              is to support research on "Starch Additives for Plastic Shaping of Ceramics." 
              The principal researchers are Dr. Christopher Schilling of Iowa State
              University and Dr. Piotr Tomasik of the Hugon Kollataj Academy of Agriculture
              in Crakow, Poland.  The researchers plan to develop a variety of new, modified
              starches that can serve as environmentally safe plasticizers and binders in the
              powder processing of advanced ceramic materials.  By developing a better
              fundamental understanding of the chemical interactions between ceramic powders
              and the new starches, the collaborators hope to establish an improved
              scientific basis for ceramic manufacturing in an industry where Edisonian
              approaches are typical.    This research in materials research fulfills the
              program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Poland
              to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of
              benefit.    ***  ??
