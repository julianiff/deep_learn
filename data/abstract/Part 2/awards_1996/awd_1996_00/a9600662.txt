Abstract    :
              9600662  Schubiger    Regeneration is a process necessary for survival.  Some
              tissues like the epidermis continuously regenerate while others, like the bone,
              only after injury.  Many aspects of regeneration are similar in different
              organisms.  For example, upon wounding in both Drosophila imaginal discs and
              amphibian limbs a blastema of dividing cells is generated.  Blastema cells
              divide rapidly and regenerate the missing structures.  There are indications
              that the same or homologous gene products are involved in the regeneration
              process.  Dr. Schubiger already has defined the role of the protooncogene
              wingless in stimulating regeneration and transdetermination.  Thus, we have a
              molecular entry point on regeneration. He plans to define how wingless
              interacts with decapentaplegic (dpp) in inducing regeneration and
              transdetermination.  Also a genetic screen will be initiated that will isolate
              mutations whose normal gene products interact with wingless in the regeneration
              process.      Dr. Schubiger study regeneration in imaginal, discs of the fly
              Drosophila because this system is accessible to a molecular genetic approach. 
              Dr. Schubiger also anticipates that many genes that function in the
              regeneration process are evolutionarily conserved.
