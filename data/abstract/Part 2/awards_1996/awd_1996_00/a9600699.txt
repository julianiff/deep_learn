Abstract    :
              9600699  Morton  This award renews support of the International Culture 
              Collection of Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhyzal fungi (INVAM)  at West Virginia
              University.  The collected organisms are soil-  borne organisms that grow in
              beneficial symbiosis with the  roots of most higher plant species.  154 species
              of such fungi  have been identified; 64 are represented in the collection, 
              along with 44 as yet unidentified strains.  Because of their  intimate
              association with plants, such fungi are likely to  play an important role in
              development of sustainable  agriculture practices and, potentially, in
              bioremediation.  The award provides partial support for the INVAM's efforts in 
              maintaining and distributing over 1000 strains now in the  collection as  well
              as the continued accession of new species  and geographic isolates.  In 1995,
              over 1000 samples were  distributed to users world-wide.  The INVAM receives 
              additional support from the University and from fees charged  to users.  ***
