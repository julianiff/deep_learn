Abstract    :
              9600628  Richey    This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative 
              research project between Dr. Jeffrey Richey, University of  Washington, Seattle
              and Dr. Jorge Quintanilla, Instituto de  Investigaciones Quimicas, Universidad
              Mayor de San Andres,  La Paz, Bolivia, and Dr. Carlos Llerena, Universidad 
              Nacional Agraria La Molina, Lima, Peru.  They will  investigate the
              biogeochemistry of natural flowing waters in  the Amazonian regions of Bolivia
              and Peru.  The goals of the  research are to characterize the chemistry and
              hydrology of  these little studied regions and to synthesize these data  with
              data already collected in the Brazilian portions of the  basin.  They will try
              to determine where are the key  "setpoints" of river chemistry in the Andean
              source regions  of the Amazon River system.  To meet these goals, the  project
              will carry out collaborative field expeditions along  transects of key Andean
              drainage basins, conduct field and  laboratory analyses at the participating
              institutions and  integrate results with basin characteristics.    The project
              will bring together, for the first time, a team  of U.S. biogeochemists and
              scientists with similar interests  from Peru and Bolivia and will directly
              address the needs of  all countries involved.  U.S. scientists will benefit 
              substantially from the input from those experts in the  region and the access
              to base laboratory, field stations,  vehicles, and human resources.  ***
