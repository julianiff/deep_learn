Abstract    :
              9600018  Stewart    Research on the political economy of party support long has
              been characterized by conflicting theoretical perspectives and sharp empirical
              disagreements about the significance of various explanatory variables.  In
              particular, two long-standing debates have focused on the roles played by
              egocentric as opposed to sociotropic, and retrospective versus prospective,
              evaluations in the formulation of party support decisions.  Intertwined with
              these debates is a general disagreement over whether the evaluation which
              exerts the largest effect can be interpreted within a rational choice
              framework.  Recognizing that comparative investigations can point in the
              direction of resolving these controversies, this research continues the
              administration of three Consumer Confidence questions in monthly British Gallup
              surveys (N=1,000).  Since the series were to be terminated in August, 1995,
              this research gathers data for 20 consecutive months (until April, 1997).  Also
              on a monthly basic, the data will be provided to the principal investigator and
              reported in the Gallup Political  and Economic Index for the purposes of many
              other scholars interested in the development and testing of a variety of
              alternative models relevant to the subjective economy of party support.  These
              data will be amenable to advanced, aggregate level econometric modeling
              procedures and sophisticated individual-level techniques.  This is a data
              resource that will be widely used by the social science research community
              interested in the topic.  ***
