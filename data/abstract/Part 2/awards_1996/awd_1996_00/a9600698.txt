Abstract    :
              9600698  Cox    This U.S.-Brazil collaborative research project is led by    Ted
              Cox of Syracuse University and Pablo Ferrari of  Universidade de Sao Paulo,
              Brazil.  The objective is to  bring together many of the U.S. and Brazilian
              leaders in  probability theory, and in particular the theory of  interacting
              particle systems, to work together in small  groups over a three-year period. 
              Rather than workshops,  the collaborations will be achieved through a series of
               trips by individuals of both countries:  NSF will fund the  U.S. scientists,
              while a counterpart grant from CNPq in  Brazil will fund the Brazilian
              scientists.  The main theme  of investigation will be systems with many
              interacting  components that evolve with time, including problems in 
              biological and spin models, spatial point processes,  metastability and
              quasi-stationary distributions, and  hydrodynamic behavior of particle systems.
                 The interactions promoted through this project will  stimulate new
              directions in an important and active research  field. They will also promote
              new links in the international  community and provide opportunities for
              graduate students at  the institutions involved.    ***
