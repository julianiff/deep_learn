Abstract    :
              9600124  Kleshchev    This grant supports the research of Professor A. Kleschev
              to work on problems in the modular representation of the finite groups. In
              particular he wants to find the mutiplicities of some composition factors of an
              irreducible representation of the symmetric group of order n. He also want to
              study branching rules for Hecke algebras via the theory of quantum groups and
              the study of irreducible representations of the alternating group and
              irreducible Specht modules.     This is research in the field of group theory.
              Group theory can be thought of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As
              such, this area has direct applications to many areas of physics and chemistry.
              Moreover, within the last 30 years, many connections to problems in data
              transmission have been solved using techniques from group theory. There are
              also direct connections to the error correcting codes that are vital for modern
              computing such as working with CD-ROM's.
