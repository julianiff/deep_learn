Abstract    :
              9600176  Covault       This proposal intends to create the first step in  making
              a ground-based air Cherenkov detector for  astrophysical gamma rays in the
              energy interval from 20 to  200GeV.  It intends to adapt and utilize a portion
              of the  very large solar and to install a receiving device (PMT's)  in the
              existing solar furnace tower.       The educational project portion also seems
              attractive  and sensible.  He will involve a graduate student and  several
              undergraduates in the research on what seems like a  sensible time scale and at
              appropriate levels.  Additionally, there is a classroom/laboratory component to
               his proposal.  Building on the work of others (most notably  Eric Mazur) he
              intends to introduce the "rapid feedback"  lecture method of Mazur's
              "Classtalk" into a course for non-  science students he will be teaching.  This
              idea has been  successful in several places but would be new to Chicago.  It
              requires some hardware, installation and shakedown use  but he has accounted
              for that (see below).  He is also  proposing to introduce CCD "photography"
              methods into the  Chicago advanced undergraduate labs.  Both of these projects 
              seem valuable in advancing instruction there and to be of  manageable scope.   
                 The proposer has had experience appropriate to this  work from both a
              particle physics and astrophysics  perspective.  He has worked in both
              astronomy and in  particle astrophysics and has been an active participant in 
              the preliminary work for STACEE.  ***
