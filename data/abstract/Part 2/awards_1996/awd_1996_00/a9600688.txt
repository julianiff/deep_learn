Abstract    :
              9600688  Shapero       Support is provided to the Board on Physics and 
              Astronomy of the National Research Council to conduct an  assessment of
              Elementary Particle Physics status and options  for its long-range future.  The
              study will be carried out by  a committee of 12 physicists over a period of 2
              years.  They  will review progress made in the last 2 decades and identify  key
              objectives for the next 2 decades.  The study is part of  a broad survey
              entitled Physics in a New Era.  ***
