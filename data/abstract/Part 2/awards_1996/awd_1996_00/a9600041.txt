Abstract    :
                After an initial buildup in the number of firms, new industries  commonly
              experience a ~shakeout~ in which the number of firms  declines sharply. 
              Shakeouts reflect an abrupt change in market  structure, and thus explaining
              them promises to illuminate the  forces shaping market structure.  Following a
              long tradition of  theorizing about the connections between market structure
              and  technological change, recent theories featuring technological  change have
              been proposed to explain shakeouts.  This project  focuses on the development
              and test of a new theory of shakeouts  featuring technological change that has
              quite different  implications regarding firm survival than the competing
              theories.    A preliminary version of the new model is developed and its 
              distinctive implications concerning firm survival are derived.  These are
              contrasted with the firm survival implications of the  competing theories.  In
              order to test the alterative theories,  data are collected on the entry and
              exit dates of all the  producers of five products that were subject to
              considerable  innovation and experienced severe shakeouts: autos, tires, 
              televisions, typewriters, and penicillin.  In addition to  studying products
              that experienced severe shakeouts, two  technologically progressive products
              that have not yet  experienced shakeouts are analyzed: lasers and petrochemical
               styrene.  Hypotheses are advanced for why these products have not  experienced
              shakeouts and a plan is laid out to test these  hypotheses using detailed data
              on entry and firm survival for  lasers and styrene.
