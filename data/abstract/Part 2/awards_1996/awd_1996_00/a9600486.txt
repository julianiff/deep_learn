Abstract    :
              9600486  Hession      This is a project requesting funding for a planning visit
              to  Mongolia by Dr. William Hession, the Academy of Natural  Sciences of
              Philadelphia.  The purpose of this planning  visit is to evaluate whether he
              can include integrated  spatial analyses and GIS activities in the study of
              Lake  Hovsgol.  The use of GIS in the analysis of environmental  changes is
              important for understanding the relationships  between biodiversity, landscape
              features, and human and  natural stressors.  This information can allow an
              integrated  analysis of natural resources and research planning in the  Hovsgol
              Nuur watershed.
