Abstract    :
              9600611  Nowak    This U.S.-Poland Workshop on Concrete Structures will be 
              conducted by Dr. Andrzej Nowak of the University of Michigan and  Professor
              Michal Knauff of the Politechnika Warszawska (Warsaw  University of
              Technology).  The objective of the workshop is to  review the current
              analytical methods and technology in analysis,  design, evaluation, repair and
              rehabilitation of concrete  structures used in Poland and identify the most
              suitable topics  for joint research projects.  The major areas to be covered 
              include: (1) development of load and resistance models for  reinforced concrete
              and prestressed concrete structures; (2)  advanced materials (high
              strength/high-performance concrete,  composites, fiber-reinforced concrete);
              (3) diagnostic procedures  (tests, performance monitors, nondestructive
              techniques, signal  processing, integrated sensor systems, microwave, acoustic
              and  optical techniques); and (4) materials and techniques for repair  and
              rehabilitation of concrete structures (reinforced and  prestressed concrete,
              new composite materials).  Accordingly the  workshop will attempt to review
              state of the art summary of main  topics as viewed in each country,  identify
              the research needs,  in particular topics for cooperative projects; and derive
              some  recommendations that reflect the needs in manpower, technology  transfer
              and education for the near future.      This workshop in civil engineering
              fulfills the program  objectives of bringing together leading experts in the
              U.S. and  Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas  of
              strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of  equality, reciprocity,
              and mutuality of benefit.  ***
