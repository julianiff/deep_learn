Abstract    :
              9600386  Cody      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-  four months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Jason A. Cody to work with Professor Jean 
              Rouxel at the Institut Universitaire de France in Nantes,  France.  Their
              project is entitled, "Synthesis,  Characterization, and Theoretical Band
              Structure  Calculations of the New Misfit-Layer Selenides   USe m NbSe2 n
              1.0<m<1.25; n=1,2 ."        Dr. Cody plans to focus his research on the
              hydrothermal  synthesis and characterization of new transition-metal 
              chalcogenides.  There will be a strong interaction with  theoretical
              band-structure calculations in an effort to  understand the physical properties
              of the new compounds.  The vast array of naturally occurring chalcogenide
              minerals  provides a starting point for this research.  The Rouxel  group
              brings their theoretical and computational expertise  together with Dr. Cody's
              experience in solid-state  synthesis.  This collaboration will help Dr. Cody
              add  theoretical calculations to his offerings as a research  advisor.  He
              plans on conducting research with  undergraduates as a professor of chemistry
              at Lake Forest  College, a small liberal arts college in Illinois.        ***
