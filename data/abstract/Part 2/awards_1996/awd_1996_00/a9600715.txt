Abstract    :
              9600715  Cox     Cilliates possess two nuclei, a vegetative macronucleus and a
              germline micronucleus. The macronucleus is produced from the micronucleus by a
              programmed series of fragmentation events of the germline chromosomes, deletion
              of some sequences and amplification of the remaining DNA. There is only limited
              information about the mechanisms involved in this process as well as the
              biological function of the deletion reactions. An in vitro system for two of
              these developmentally programmed DNA deletion reactions will be developed, the
              M and R region deletions from the ciliate, Tetrahymena thermophila. Previous
              work from this laboratory has suggested a likely deletion pathway and a
              protocol is envisioned in which new DNA substrates are first tested in vivo and
              then assays are carried out to detect individual steps of the projected
              recombination process in vitro. To facilitate the purification of any relevant
              enzymes detected,  methods to produce large-scale cultures of synchronously
              mating cells will be developed. The ultimate goal is a complete molecular
              description of the deletion pathway derived from studies of an in vitro system
              reconstituted from purified enzymes and substrates.  %%%  Programmed DNA
              rearrangements are not only a normal part of mammalian genome mechanisms (i.e.
              immunoglobulin genes) but also of aberrant genome phenomena (i.e.
              tumorogensis). An understanding of the biochemistry of genome restructuring in
              simple one-celled organisms such as Tetrahymena can give insight into the
              mechanisms utilized by more advanced organisms such as humans.  ***
