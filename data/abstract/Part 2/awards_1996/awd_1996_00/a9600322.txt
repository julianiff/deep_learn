Abstract    :
                   This proposal will provide necessary R&D for a group of  Universities
              participating in the CMS collaboration at the  LHC.       The University of
              California at San Diego group, will  address design a trigger and data
              acquisition (DAQ)  electronics; Johns Hopkins will be concerned with the 
              silicon pixel and strip tracking devices and with  computation and software
              design; the University of Illinois  at Chicago will be concerned with the
              signal transmitting  fibers of the scintillator-tile hadron calorimetry;
              Nebraska  will participate in development of the luminosity monitor; 
              Northeastern will be concerned with developing improved  avalanche
              photo-detector (APD) devices to convert optical to  electric pulses from the
              calorimeters, microstrip gas  chamber trackers, and computing and software;
              Notre Dame  will design devices to couple transmission optical fibers  from the
              hadron calorimeters to their readout; Virginia Tech  will participate in
              testing photodetectors.  All groups  will, as appropriate, will produce
              prototypes and engage in  beam tests.
