Abstract    :
              9600229  Han    This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Daxing Han  of
              Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of  North Carolina at
              Chapel Hill and Dr. Shoji Nitta at Faculty  of Engineering of Gifu University. 
              Project funding will  enable Dr. Han to spend three months in Japan, resident
              at  Gifu University, in order to study the structure disorder  parameter in
              semiconductor fullerene films.  Dr. Han has  previously studied the structure
              disorder in non-crystalline  semiconductors.  Dr. Nitta has been investigating
              the  optical absorption of semiconductor fullerene film.  Dr. Han  will combine
              her expertise with that of Dr. Nitta to study  the correlation between
              structure disorder and conducting  properties in semiconducting fullerence.   
              This proposal brings together research scientists from two  countries working
              in the area of fullerence.  Fullerence and  related materials have attracted
              great interest in recent  years because of their unusual properties and
              potential  applications.  The U.S. scientist will have the opportunity  to
              become familiar with fullerene film preparation, research  techniques, and
              facilities at Gifu University while  contributing to the overall research
              effort.  Therefore,  this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in
              its  exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an  international
              collaboration.  ***
