Abstract    :
              PI: Fefferman  DMS-9540525    The PI will investigate analytic problems which
              arise in differential geometry.  One project is concerned with semilinear
              elliptic equations on simply connected domains in Euclidean 4-space.  The
              domain is viewed as the universal cover of a complete conformally flat
              manifold.  The second project will be the study of coupled elliptic-parabolic
              equations.  By coupling an elliptic equation to Hamilton's Ricci flow, one can
              impose control on the scalar curvature, so that if the scalar curvature is a
              negative to begin with, then it remains so at least for short time.    Partial
              differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical
              world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the
              equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about
              the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness,
              smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for
              approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these
              approximations.
