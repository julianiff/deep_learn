Abstract    :
              9600342  Sheaff    This Americas Program award will support collaborative 
              research between Dr. Marleigh Sheaff of the University of  Wisconsin, Professor
              John Cumalat of the University of  Colorado,  Professor Hector Mendez and
              Professor Gerardo  Herrera of CINVESTAV-IPN in Mexico, in experimental 
              elementary particle physics.  Specifically, the researchers  intend to
              concentrate on a charm photoproduction experiment  (E831) to be performed at
              Fermilab, in order to conduct high  precision studies of varied charmed meson
              and baryon states.    The researchers intend to conduct a systematic study of
              the  lifetimes and other properties of charmed baryons and will  work on
              upgrades to the existing Wide Band Photon Lab  Spectrometer that will
              significantly extend the physics  reach of the E831 experiment.  Responsibility
              for  maintaining the detectors during data taking and the  analysis of the
              collected data will be shared by both sides.  The project will contribute to
              the internationalization of  large science projects; its emphasis on student
              involvement  will help to promote future collaborations.    ***
