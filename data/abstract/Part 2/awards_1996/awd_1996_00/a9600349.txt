Abstract    :
              9600349  West    This Americas Program award will fund travel and related 
              expenses for Dr. Douglas X. West and two students from  Illinois State
              University, to travel to Mexico to  collaborate on a research project with Dr.
              Jesus Valdes-  Martinez, of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico 
              (UNAM).  They will conduct studies to synthesize and  characterize a series of
              macrocyclic and polynuclear metal  complexes.  The study of these complexes
              will present  interesting chemical challenges as well as the possibility  of
              biological activity.    The project will allow for a strong complementary 
              interaction between the two researchers and their students.  The Mexican side
              will bring to the collaboration their  expertise in crystal structures and
              solid state information,  while the U.S. group will provide organic ligands, 
              spectroscopy data, and interpretation of the Mexican  compounds.  ***
