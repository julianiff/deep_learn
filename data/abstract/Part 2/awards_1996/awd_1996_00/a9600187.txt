Abstract    :
              9600187  Reskin    This doctoral dissertation improvement proposal examines the
              effects of organizational and environmental factors on employers' investments
              in employee training.  It is hypothesized that the amount of training hours and
              the number of training courses offered/ taken are positively related to
              affiliate size, environmental complexity, labor market competition, and
              profits.  The investigator will study a large for-profit corporation, its
              affiliates, and 500 employees within these affiliates.  The diverse and
              geographically dispersed affiliates of this organization will permit the
              investigator to explore how affiliate-specific organizational characteristics
              affect the process and outcomes of training.  The three basic questions that
              will be investigated are:  (1) What effect does an organization's environment
              and structure have on the amount of employee training the organization
              provides?, (2) How do these features influence the structure of the training
              department? and (3) What is the relationship between the organizational
              structure, environment, characteristics of individual employees and the amounts
              and type of training that employees with different characteristics receive? 
              This research will inform theoretical and empirical debate in the sociology of
              organizations as well as orgnizational and governmental training policies.  %%%
               Data will be collected through surveys of individual employees, in-depth
              interviews, archival sources, and participant observation.  Organizational- and
              individual- level data will be analyzed using multi-level statistical
              techniques.
