Abstract    :
              INT 9600473  Yarmoff      This U.S.-Czech materials research project between
              Jory Yarmoff of the University of California, Riverside, and Zeenek Sroubek of
              the Czech Institute of Radio Engineering and Electronics, Prague, will feature
              investigations of the physics of electronic excitation processes induced in
              solids by particle bombardment. Efforts will involve measurements of the
              scattered ion energy spectra, neutral fractions, and angular distributions,
              along with measurements of the associated electron emissions during low energy
              particle scattering and sputtering.  The researchers will consider these
              excitations in metals, semiconductors and insulators and draw upon theoretical
              analyses including molecular dynamics with the use of clusters and
              pseudopotentials, as well as complete quantum mechanical models.  Results have
              potential bearing in modern particle-beam technologies.    The project in
              material research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
              knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to
              combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong
              mutual interest and competence.   ??
