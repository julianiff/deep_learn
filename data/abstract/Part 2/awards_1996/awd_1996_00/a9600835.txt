Abstract    :
              96-00835  Graham         Eukaryotic cells consist of functionally distinct 
              membrane-delimited compartments called organelles. Of these,  the endoplasmic
              reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex form an  integrated system of membranes
              called the secretory pathway.  Proteins are targeted to the ER, modified, and
              are packaged  into membrane-bound vesicles that are themselves targeted to  the
              cis face of the multi-compartment Golgi complex.       The Golgi complex acts
              as a sorting center for proteins  as well as for lipids in the secretory
              pathway. The Golgi  complex contains porters that import sugar and sulfur 
              nucleotides into the lumen of the cisternae of the Golgi  compartments.
              Transferases within the Golgi complex catalyze  the assembly of these
              components into a diverse menagerie of  glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and
              glycolipids. Once  assembled, the glycoconjugates are sorted and packaged into 
              vesicular carriers for export to specific subcellular  destinations. The
              cisternae of the Golgi complex are  organized into stacks that are divided into
              a cis face (ER  proximal), medial, trans, and trans Golgi network. It is 
              presumed that vectorial transport between the cisternae  occurs through
              membrane bound vesicles.       While lipids and proteins flow through the Golgi
               complex, the Golgi complex itself must maintain its  integrity. How this is
              achieved is poorly understood.  Budding of vesicles from the Golgi complex
              requires a small  guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding protein ADP- 
              ribosylation factor (ARF). ARF is posited to associate with  membranes and aid
              in the recruitment of vesicle coat  components. Two classes of vesicles coat,
              clathrin and COP  I, apparently require ARF for membrane binding. By analogy 
              to other small GTP-binding proteins, several effectors  should modulate ARF
              activity in vivo. These effectors for  ARF are as yet unknown.       The PI
              will use genetic techniques developed in  Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify
              effectors that interact  with ARF. In addition, this  technique may allow for
              the  discovery of genes whose products are required for the  proper functioning
              of the Golgi complex. Previous genetic  screens for mutants defective in
              secretion (sec) have  uncovered very few mutants effecting protein transport 
              through the yeast Golgi complex. The genetic screen for new  mutants and their
              characterization will be carried out as  part of an undergraduate laboratory
              exercise in genetics.  This course will be designed to allow the students to 
              experience the excitement of probing the unknown and of  discovering unknown
              genes, while learning techniques in  screening mutants and in testing for
              complementation.  %%%       Eukaryotic cells consist of functionally distinct
