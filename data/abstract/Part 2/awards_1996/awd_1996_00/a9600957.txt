Abstract    :
                                              9600957  Williams                               
                This is a 24 month award proposed by Dr. Stanley Williams,  Arizona State
              University   and Dr. Raymundo Punongbayan,  the Philippine Institute of
              Volcanology and Seismology.  This project is to understand the eruption that
              produced the  extensive Scoria Flow (SFL)  at Taal Volcano, the  Philippines. 
              It  requests funds for travel for the P.I. and  his graduate student, and the
              field cost to collect sediment  samples from Taal Volcano, which is located in
              Batangas  Province, southern Luzon Island, Philippines.  This project  will
              collect information on geological, petrologic and  geochemical characteristics
              of  Scoria flow.   This is an  important project involving  at one of the
              world's more  dangerous volcanoes.  The data collected will lead to a  better
              understanding of  whether the eruption in this region  is a gradual build up or
              a short, instantaneous one.  Results are important for evaluating and assessing
              the  extended natural hazards from future volcano eruptions in  this region.
