Abstract    :
              9600398  Murthy      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour  months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of ulique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Srihari Murthy to the laboratory of
              Professor  Hannes Lichte at the Technische Universitat Dresden in  Dresden,
              Germany.        Dr. Murthy and Professor Lichte propose to employ high 
              resolution electron holography to systematically obtain  structure images of
              individual gold and silver nanocrystals  in various crystallographic
              orientations, and from this to  obtain three-dimensional morphologies of these
              nanocrystals  with atomic-scale detail.  They will also obtain structure 
              images of the thiolate layer (which is made up of light  atoms) and hence not
              imaged by conventional high resolution  techniques on gold/silver nanocrystal
              surfaces using high  resolution electron holography.  These studies will serve
              to  significantly extend our understanding of the structure of  these important
              new materials.  ***
