Abstract    :
              Fulton    The research in this proposal concerns a variety of topics in
              algebraic geometry and related fields, including:  topology of algebraic
              varieties;  degeneracy loci and classical groups;  configuration spaces; 
              curves on Calabi-Yau threefolds; compactifications of moduli spaces; 
              intersection theory, Chow groups, and relations with K-theory; p-adic Hodge
              theory;  representation theory, including Langlands dual group; group
              cohomology and Koszul algebras; conic bundles and Mori fibrations.    Algebraic
              geometry has a long and important history in mathematics, particularly because
              it interacts with so many other fields of mathematics, such as topology,
              analysis, algebra, and number theory.  It has flourished during the last half
              of the twentieth century, especially in this country.  The recent interactions
              with physics have brought a new energy to the field, since we have learned that
              very classical problems - like counting the numbers of plane curves passing
              through a given set of points - are intimately related to ideas like mirror
              symmetry in modern physics.  This is another example of a problem that seemed
              to be of purely theoretical interest in mathematics that has turned out to have
              unexpected connections with another subject, to their mutual benefit.  At its
              simplest and most fundamental level, algebraic geometry studies sets defined by
              polynomial equations; such sets arise in many problems in computer science and
              robotics, and there is increasing interaction between algebraic geometry and
              these fields.
