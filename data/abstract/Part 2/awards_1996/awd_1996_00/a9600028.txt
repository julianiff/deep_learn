Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9600028  Hilary S. Lackritz  Purdue University      Funds are
              requested for travel support of overseas and academic speakers in the symposium
              entitled "Polymeric Thin Films for Photonic Applications" to be held at the
              National ACS meeting, Orlando, Florida, August 25-30, 1996 under the Division
              of Polymer Chemistry (Poly) and the Division of Polymeric Materials:  Science &
              Engineering (PMSE), of the American Chemical Society (ACS).  The optical
              Society of America (OSA) is cosponsoring this symposium.    The principle
              objective in organizing this symposiums to promulgate the science of nonlinear
              optical polymers (NLOP) which has emerged as an important and exciting area for
              research.  This symposium is designed to bring together chemists and optical
              scientists to discuss polymer science capabilities and photonic device
              requirements so that their combined efforts will to lead to new advances.  We
              will have scheduled detailed tutorials on Sunday, August 25, to introduce NLO
              theory, optical characterization techniques, physics of glassy polymers, thin
              films waveguide fabrication, and promising applications, which will provide the
              researchers with a solid basis from which they may direct their research
              programs.
