Abstract    :
              This research is on the numerical study of strongly  gravitating systems with
              special emphasis on the properties  of the gravitational waves they generated
              in dynamical  evolutions.  This uses supercomputers for fully numerical 
              treatments, and semi-analytical methods closely coupled to  the numerical
              treatments, to study highly non-linear and  dynamical astrophysical events,
              like the inspiral  coalescence of compact binary systems consisting of neutron 
              stars and/or black holes.  One of the focuses of the research is on the
              accurate  numerical constructions and analyses of 3D black hole  spacetimes. 
              Instead of the traditional approach of using  time slicings to avoid the
              singularities inherent in black  hole spacetimes, Prof. Suen's group will
              develop an approach  in full 3+1 numerical relativity which uses the apparent 
              horizons as inner boundaries in dynamical evolutions.  This  apparent horizon
              boundary condition approach is expected to  have major impact on the numerical
              study of black hole  spacetimes.  Apparent horizons and event horizons are 
              important characteristic of black holes.  The PI is  developing routines to
              determine their existence and  locations, as well as tools for analyzing their
              properties,  in a numerically constructed 3+1 dimensional spacetime.  These
              routines, to be available to the numerical relativity  community soon, will
              have impact on the study of black  holes.
