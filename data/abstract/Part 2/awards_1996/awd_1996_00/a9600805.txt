Abstract    :
              Hurley  9600805      The cells of the hypothalamic region of the brain produce
              small  protein hormones called peptide releasing- and release-inhibiting 
              factors which act on the pituitary gland to regulate the synthesis  and
              secretion of the peripherally active hormones derived from this  tissue.  While
              it is clear that the hypothalamic releasing- and  release-inhibiting peptides
              bind to receptors on pituitary cells,  and alter intracellular levels of second
              messengers such as cyclic  AMP or calcium, the downstream events that link the
              intracellular  messengers to alterations in gene expression are presently
              unclear.   Dr. Hurley is characterizing a newly discovered intranuclear 
              factor, Zn-15, that may prove to be one of the important links  between the
              second messenger systems and regulation of gene  transcription.  He is
              determining the mechanisms involved in the  physiological regulation of the
              expression of Zn-15 and the ability  of Zn-15 to control expression of
              pituitary hormone genes. These  investigations will result in novel information
              concerning the  regulation of the function of the neuroendocrine axis, and 
              organismal growth and development.  In this CAREER proposal, the  educational
              component includes the development of novel  computer-assisted learning program
              for basic biochemistry and  expansion of the use of this powerful tool into all
              levels of  higher education.  In addition, significant integration of research 
              skills with computer tutelage is to be used to foster undergraduate  interest
              in biochemical neuroendocrinology.  These endeavors will  provide the students
              with unique educational and research  opportunities intended to develop new
              generations of researchers  and educators.
