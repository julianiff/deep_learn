Abstract    :
              9600964  Scholl  This award to Ohio State University renews support for the 
              Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC), a collection of  Arabidopsis
              thaliana seeds and DNAs.  The collection includes  seed of a large number of 
              known mutants, large sets of seed  obtained from plants mutagenized through
              several means, and a  similarly large variety of isolated individual genes,
              genomic  libraries and cloned DNA copies of messenger RNAs.  For a  modest fee,
              the ABRC provides samples of its collection on  request, primarily to
              researchers in the US, but also to  investigators in foreign countries. 
              Through a subcontract to  Michigan State University, the award includes support
              for  further development of the Arabidopsis Information Management  System
              (AIMS), an online database and forms-based ordering  system that facilitates
              access to the ABRC.  In recent years,  the ABRC has provided over 35,000 seed
              samples, and 8000  samples of DNA on an annual basis.  Because of its role as a
               central repository, the ABRC plays a crucial role in the  coordinated
              international effort to sequence the Arabidopsis  genome.
