Abstract    :
              9600974  Naegele  Understanding the cellular and molecular processes that lead
              to the formation of precise connections in the nervous system  is one of the
              major tasks of  neuroscience.  This  proposal is directed to one key aspect of
              the general  problem: the role of neuronal activity, competition and  cell-cell
              competition in the embryonic brain.  Remodelling of the initial connections
              made in the embryo is an important part of the process by which the functioning
              brain circuits are refined  during development.  Few studies have addressed the
              role of the immune system in these processes.  This proposal  seeks to explore
              the role of  special cells, the microglia that typically act as scavengers ,
              attacking diseased or damaged cells.  The working hypothesis for this proposal
              is that the microglia and associated immune system molecules may play a part in
              the refinement of neural connections during development.   This research
              program, as a Career award, will  involve undergraduate participation in the
              laboratory.
