Abstract    :
              9600288  Beatrice      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-  four months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit which will support Dr. Pamela Beatrice to work
              with  Professor Costas G. Vayenas at the University of Patras in  Greece for
              six months and then return to the United States  to work with Professor Wayne
              L. Worrell at the University of  Pennsylvania for six months.        Solid
              oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have potential for  simultaneous operation as both a
              generator od electrical  power and a chemical reactor for several industrially 
              important catalytic oxidation processes.  This project will  evaluate the
              electrocatalyic and catalytic properties of the  mixed electronically and
              ionically conducting yttria-titania-  zirconia materials which show great
              promise as an anode  material in SOFCs.  The materials have been developed and 
              evaluated for their ionic and electrical conducting  properties at the
              University of Pennsylvania under Professor  Worrell.  The study consists of two
              parts:  the first is the  electrocatalytic and catalytic evaluation to be made
              at the  University of Patras, with the help of Professor Vayenas,  and the
              second is a microstructural characterization to be  done at Penn with Professor
              Worrell.    ***
