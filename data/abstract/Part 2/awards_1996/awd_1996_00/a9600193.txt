Abstract    :
                   A program of both research and teaching in physics will be  carried out. 
              The research, theoretical in nature, will pursue in  a variety of ways the
              possibility that the dark matter in the  universe-matter which is known to
              exist because of its  gravitational effects but which does not emit any light
              that  would make it visible - is composed of elementary particles  different
              from those already discovered in the laboratory.  Extensions of existing theory
              that may point to such new  particles will be pursued.  Methods for detecting
              the new  particles will be explored.  Models of the universe which contain  the
              new particles and/or other novel features will be studied.  The teaching will
              entail a number of innovations.  These include  allowing students in an
              introductory physics course to hone their  problem-solving skills by applying
              concepts they learn in class  to mechanical systems which they analyze, design,
              and build.  Also included is the creation of videotaped lectures for 
              distribution to universities in third-world countries.       The question of
              the nature of the dark matter is one of the  central issues in astrophysics, so
              the research addressing this  question will be very important.  Creative
              innovations in the  teaching of science to university students, both here and
              abroad  are of great importance to the healthy future of science and  society.
