Abstract    :
              9600411  Sculli       This grant supports research in elementary-particle 
              physics by three NYU faculty, 2 postdoctoral research  associates and a
              graduate student.  Two disparate research  activities are supported.  First is
              the continued study of  collisions of antiprotons with protons at 2 TeV in the 
              Tevatron collider at Fermilab as members of the DO  collaboration.  The group's
              analysis focuses on  determination of the W boson mass; its contribution to the
               detector upgrade is to the new fiber-tracker front-end and  trigger
              electronics.  As members of the team constructing  the MILAGRO cosmic gamma-ray
              detector at the Los Alamos  National lab site, they are preparing to study
              cosmic-ray  energy distributions and search for sources of photons in  the
              high-energy interval from 1 to 100 TeV.  ***
