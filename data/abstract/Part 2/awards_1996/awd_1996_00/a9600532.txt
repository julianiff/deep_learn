Abstract    :
                    9600532  Brusslan  Undifferentiated cells of the plant meristem contain
              proplastids.  When leaf development is initiated, proplastids develop into
              chloroplasts, the site of photosynthesis and carbon fixation.  Although
              numerous mutations that alter the chloroplast have been isolated from a large
              number of plant species, none so far have led to a clear understanding of the
              molecular events involved in chloroplast development.  Arabidopsis thaliana
              offers an opportunity to understand this process because genes identified by
              mutation can be cloned.  Virescent mutants that display a delay in greening and
              hence a delay in chloroplast development, have been isolated in the model plant
              Arabidopsis thaliana.  The goal of this research is to characterize these
              mutants biochemically and genetically in order to determine which mutants are
              likely to be defective in the signal transduction pathways that regulate
              chlorplast development.  A second goal is to analyze the pigments and proteins
              of the light harvesting complexes (LHCs) of all mutants, regulatory or
              non-regulatory.  The assembly of the LHCs has not been regorously investigated
              on a genetic level in higher plants.    Chloroplasts are essential for life on
              earth because photosynthesis produces oxygen and consumes carbon dioxide.  A
              clear understanding of the development of the organelle that performs this
              important function is important for agriculatural and global warming research.
