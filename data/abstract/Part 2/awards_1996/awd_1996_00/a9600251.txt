Abstract    :
              9600215  Brillinger    This U.S.-Brazil collaborative research project between 
              David Brillinger of the University of California Berkeley  and Pedro Morretin
              of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil  will develop statistical aspects of
              wavelet techniques for  different stochastic models with application to some
              new and  practical situations using economic, biological, and  physical data.
              Autoregressive processes, state space models,  linear systems, seasonal effect
              schemes, Markov chains,  point processes and generalized linear models will be 
              studied.    The proposed research will create a new collaborative link  between
              statisticians in Berkeley and Sao Paulo, including  the active participation of
              graduate students on both sides.  The Brazilian side will be funded by CNPq,
              the Brazilian  federal science funding organization.    ***
