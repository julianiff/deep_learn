Abstract    :
              9600266  Olson      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-  four months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Martin D. Olson and Dr. Randy Thaman of the
               University of the South Pacific in Suva, Fiji.        The purpose of this
              project is to investigate the  differences between environmental policies and
              practices in  various historical, geographic, ecological and political 
              contexts within Fiji, focusing on governing institutions,  their forms and the
              ways in which they are politically and  socially constituted, the evolution of
              their policies and  interrelations at various levels of local, state and 
              regional authority, and their influence in shaping what  people do in land and
              sea.        ***
