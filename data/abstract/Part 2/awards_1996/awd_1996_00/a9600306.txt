Abstract    :
              Does the general public experience sharp discontinuity in their attitudes and
              behavior as a result of political changes initiated at the elite level?  The
              possibility that mass attitudes are quite stable during periods of tumultuous
              change can have two very different implications for the success of political
              and economic transitions.  In one instance, mass attitudes might be perfectly
              consistent with the success of the new institutions.  In this case, education
              and diffusion of information produce a citizenry well-versed in the norms of
              democratic capitalism.  On the other hand, mass attitudes could be out of synch
              with the political and economic revolution, in which case attitude stability
              may well undermine the changes in the long run.    This project evaluates the
              role played by attitude change in the transition from communist societies to
              democracy and free markets.  Specifically, the project will examine attitudinal
              change and stability in Hungary between 1989 and 1996.      To answer these
              questions about the public's role, analyses of survey data along with
              macro-level social and economic indicators collected previously will be
              subjected to secondary analysis.   Based on this work, the principal
              investigator together with his Hungarian collaborators will develop and field a
              national probability survey of current attitudes.  The final phase of the
              project will bring together Eastern and Western scholars investigating
              democratic transition in a series of conferences to examine the state of
              knowledge about transition processes.
