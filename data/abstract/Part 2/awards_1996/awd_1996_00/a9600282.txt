Abstract    :
              9600282  Moore    This U.S.-Argentina collaborative research project will 
              explore conditions under which photochemical reactions of  carotenoids
              (pigments found in living organisms) can be  elicited.  In nature, they play a
              role in photosynthesis,  but in solutions they are not photochemically
              reactive.  The  Argentine collaborators, Leonides Sereno and Juana Silber at 
              the Universidad Nacional de Rio Cuarto in Cordoba will bring  to the
              collaboration both the laboratory facilities and the  expertise for the
              electrochemical experiments, while the  PIs, Ana Moore, Thomas Moore, and J.
              Devens Gust at Arizona  State University, will carry out the synthesis of new 
              carotenoids and spectroscopic work.    A number of students and post doctoral
              researchers in both  countries will be involved in the studies.  The grant will
               include support for some of these younger people to travel  to Argentina with
              a PI.  Support for the Argentine  scientists will be provided by CONICET in
              that country,  including travel to the U.S.  ***
