Abstract    :
              9600578  Kenagy    This Americas Program award will support a collaborative 
              research project between Dr. George Kenagy, University of  Washington, Seattle,
              and Dr. Francisco Bozinovic, Pontificia  Universidad Catolica de Chile.  The
              objective of the  proposed  project is to characterize the profile of energy 
              expenditure for breeding in the degu, a rodent belonging to  a South American
              group, the Caviomorpha.  This group  undertakes a lengthy gestation leading to
              birth of highly  precocial young requiring only a brief period of suckling. 
              The study will seek to identify the peak demand and  expenditure of energy and
              to see how these correspond  to  the maximal performance capacities of the
              selected species.  Stable isotope technology will be used to measure rates of 
              energy expenditure.  An initial assessment will be made of  the link between
              energetics and the mode of life history  that has evolved in caviomorph
              rodents.     Life history theory has produced the idea that for  iteroparous
              animals an increase in current reproductive  output should have a negative
              impact on future reproductive  potential and survival.  Evidence from genetic
              correlations  and individual variation in performance continues to lend 
              support to the possibility that energy relations are indeed  a link between
              organismal performance and fitness.  This  study will address the role of
              energy in shaping life  histories by providing insights into the process of
              energy  use in a natural mammalian population and its relation to  maximum
              energetic capacities of females during gestation or  lactation.  This will
              include the mammalian maternal  strategy of producing precocial young.    ***
