Abstract    :
                   This proposal centers around nuclear theory and its  application to issues
              of importance in astrophysics and  particle physics. Traditionally, the atomic
              nucleus is  viewed as a system of neutrons and protons -- the nucleons.  The
              interactions between nucleons lead to a variety of  collective properties,
              involving neutrons and protons moving  coherently.  Projects to understand why
              many nuclei exhibit  collective behavior typical of an enharmonic vibrator and
              to  assess the role of proton-neutron collective pair  correlations in nuclei
              near the proton drip line are  proposed.  Despite the enormous success of the
              traditional  picture, there is now great interest in going one step  deeper, to
              obtain a consistent picture of nuclei directly  from the quark constituents of
              the nucleon.  Baryon mappings  have been suggested as a practical approach for
              realizing  this goal.  Several issues related to implementation of this  method
              will be investigated, followed by detailed  applications to real nuclear
              systems. Nuclear physics also  plays an important role in efforts to extract
              information of  fundamental importance in astrophysics. Two such  applications
              will be considered -- a study of the response  of a proposed iodine detector to
              solar neutrinos and a  treatment of the beta decays associated with r- and p- 
              process nucleosynthesis.
