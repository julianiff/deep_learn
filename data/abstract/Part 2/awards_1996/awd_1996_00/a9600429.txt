Abstract    :
              9600429  Mohapatra       The particle theory group of the University of Maryland
              will  host the Fourth International Conference on Supersymmetry,  Supergravity,
              and Superstrings, SUSY `96, from May 29, 1996  through June 1, 1996.      
              About six sessions covering theoretical developments in the  areas of the
              minimal supersymmetric model and its tests,  supersymmetric grand unification
              and attempts to understand quark  and lepton masses, supersymmetric QCD and
              duality, and neutrino  masses and cosmology are being planned.  An additional
              two to  three sessions will deal with experimental results from existing 
              searches for supersymmetry, data on top quarks, searches for  neutrino masses
              and dark matter.  ***
