Abstract    :
              9600914  Ciuffetti  Research:  This is a CAREER Award.  A major goal of modern
              plant biology is a molecular definition of factors that regulate plant-microbe
              interactions.  The PI is investigating a disease called tan spot of wheat which
              is caused by the fungus, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis.  This fungus is
              pathogenic because it produces the host-selective toxin (HST) called Ptr toxin.
               Unlike all other HSTs, Ptr toxin is a protein and the direct product of a
              single gene.  Thus, pathogenicity in this fungus is regulated by a single gene
              for toxin production.  Also, genetic evaluation of sensitivity to Ptr toxin has
              demonstrated that the wheat response to the toxin and consequently,
              susceptibility to the pathogen, is controlled by a single dominant gene.  The
              research component of this award is composed of four specific objectives which
              encompass a diversity of approaches including an immunological, biochemical,
              and genetical approach to the identificaiton of the site-of-action of Ptr
              toxin:    Objective 1. IDENTIFICATION AND GENETIC CHARACTERIZATION OF     
              DIPLOID WHEATS SENSITIVE TO PTR TOXIN.  Objective 2. PRODUCTION OF LABELED
              DERIVATIVES AND      BIOCHEMICAL IDENTIFICATION OF THE SITE-OF-   
              ACTION/RECEPTOR OF PTR TOXIN.  Objective 3. GENETICAL ANALYSIS OF INTERACTIONS
              BETWEEN THE    TOXIN AND ITS SITE-OF-ACTION/RECEPTOR USING     THE YEAST
              TWO-HYBRID SYSTEM.  Objective 4. IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION OF THE
              SITE-OF-   ACTION/RECEPTOR OF PTR TOXIN.    Education:  Development of an
              effective academic career in the plant sciences requires integration of both
              research and education.  Oregon State University and the Department of Botany
              and Plant Pathology are committed to this integration.  In keeping with the
              mission of the University and the Department toward graduate and undergraduate
              training, the recruitment of underrepresented individuals into science, and
              outreach to the community, the education career plan is composed of four main
              objectives:    Objective 1.  INCORPORATION OF VIDEOM ICROSCOPY, COMPUTER    
              ENHANCED IMAGING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES    IN TEACHING UNDERGRADUATE
              PLANT SCIENCES.  Objective 2.  TRAINING GRADUATE STUDENTS TO BE MORE     
              EFFECTIVE EDUCATORS IN THE PLANT SCIENCES.  Objective 3.  COMMITMENT TO WOMEN
              AND TRAINING OF      UNDERGRADUATES FOR A CAREER IN THE SCIENCES.  Objective 4.
               SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY.    This PI's research projects provide the
              underlying scientific subject for the education activities.
