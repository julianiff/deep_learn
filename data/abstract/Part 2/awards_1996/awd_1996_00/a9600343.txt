Abstract    :
              INT-9600343  Monteiro    This U.S.-Brazil collaborative research project between
               Renato Monteiro at Georgia Institute of Technology and the  Brazilian
              researcher Alfredo Iusem of IMPA in Rio de Janeiro  will utilize proximal
              interior point methods (PIP) for  solving constrained optimization problems. 
              Issues to be  addressed include superlinear convergence, convergence of  the
              generated dual sequence in linear and convex quadratic  programming,
              characterization of the limit of the primal  sequence, and study of continuous
              trajectories and  approximate versions of PIP algorithms. The development will 
              parallel recent developments in classical interior point  methods.    The
              proposed research will create a new collaborative link  between mathematicians
              in Georgia Tech and Rio de Janeiro.  The proposed effort, by bridging two areas
              so far treated  independently, should provide better understanding and new  and
              more effective methods for an important class of  problems.    ***
