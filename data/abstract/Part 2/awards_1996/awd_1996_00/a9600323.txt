Abstract    :
              9600323  Oyama    This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Ted Oyama of 
              the Department of Chemical Engineering at Virginia  Polytechnic Institute and
              Dr. Yasuhiro Iwasawa of the  Department of Chemistry at the University of
              Tokyo.  Project  funding will enable Dr. Oyama to spend one year in Japan, 
              resident at the University of Tokyo, in order  to study the structure and
              adsorption properties of single  crystal molybdenum carbide.  Dr. Oyama has
              previously  studied the catalytic properties of molybdenum carbide in  the form
              of supported and unsupported powders.  The  collaboration with Prof. Iwasawa
              will allow fundamental  studies of the system using advanced physico-chemical
              tools  available in Prof. Iwasawa's laboratory.  These include  ultra-high
              vacuum spectroscopies and scanning tunneling  microscopy.    This proposal
              brings toeether research scientists from two  countries working in the area of
              new materials and  catalysis. The U. S. scientist will have the opportunity to 
              become familiar with research techniques, equipment, and  facilities at the
              University of Tokyo while carrying out the  research mission.  This proposal
              thus fulfills the  objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of 
              scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***
