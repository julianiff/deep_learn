Abstract    :
              INT 9600462  Raikhel        This U.S.-Czech research project between Dr. Natasha
              Raikhel of Michigan State University and Dr. Bretislav Brzobohaty of the Czech
              Institute of Biophysics, Brno, will examine plant hormones that mediate
              features of plant development.  Specifically, the researchers intend to study
              the role played by subcellular compartmentation in regulation of phytohormone
              activity.  This will be done by reversible conjugation, using a cloned maize
              cytokinin glucosidase (cDNA, Zm-p60.1).  The extent of the cytokinin release
              will be determined in the process and the observed physiological responses
              caused by the released cytokinins will be analyzed.  Initial findings will
              contribute to the research team's efforts to construct and molecularly
              characterize transgenic plants that express accumulations of Zm-p60.1 in
              various subcellular compartments.    The research is expected to improve our
              fundamental understanding of the cytokinin role in the developmental switch in
              plants from the vegetative to the reproductive phase.  New knowledge of various
              effects of released cytokinins on activities such as floral transition, root
              development, seed production, and photosynthetic capacity may lead to results
              that permit control of some agriculturally important traits in crops.    This
              project in plant cellular science fulfills the program objective of advancing
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in
              areas of mutual interests and competence.          ??
