Abstract    :
                This three-year award, which supports U.S.-France cooperative research in
              molecular biology, involves Maria Tasayco of the City University of New York's
              City College and Michel Godlberg and Alain Chaffotte of the Institut Pasteur in
              Paris, France.  The objective of their research is to study the protein folding
              problem.  Specifically, they will investigate pathways by which fragments of E.
              Coli thioredoxin reconstitute the original structure of macromolecules. 
              Through the study of the function of thioredoxin, they propose to elucidate
              structure and the protein folding pathway.  The U.S. investigator brings to
              this collaboration expertise in structural studies and approaches.  This is
              complemented by the French investigators' expertise in kinetic studies of
              protein folding.  The research will advance our understanding of the
              relationship between structure and function in biological macromolecules.
