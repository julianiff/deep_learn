Abstract    :
              9600923  de Hostos       The objective of this project is to define the function
              of the protein coronin.  The Principal Investigator discovered coronin as a
              component of a complex of actin and myosin prepared in vitro from a cytoplasmic
              fraction of Dictyostelium discoideum.  The protein is associated with the
              cortical actin cytoskeleton of Dictyostelium cells.  It contains a sequence
              motif known as WD-40 repeats (or beta-transducin), which was first identified
              in the beta-subunits of trimeric G-proteins.  Mutants lacking coronin are
              impaired in their ability to undergo cytokinesis and ameboid locomotion.  A
              similar protein was subsequently identified by a Japanese group from human and
              bovine sources, suggesting that the significance of coronin extends beyond
              merely the biology of slime molds.   Dictyostelium is an ideal model system for
              studying coronin, because the cells perform a variety of actin-based motile
              processes, and they are amenable to molecular genetic manipulations.  Mutant
              cells will be examined by immunofluorescence, video, and electron microscopy in
              order to more precisely formulate a hypothesis that coronin is involved in the
              dynamics of extension or retraction of cortical processes during locomotion. 
              In addition, the coronin mutants will be used to investigate the function and
              structure of the WD-40 repeats and to attempt to clarify the role of this
              sequence motif in general.  These repeats are being found in a growing number
              of proteins and are thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions. 
              The ability to genetically manipulate coronin expression in Dictyostelium cells
              makes this a particularly good system in which to investigate this problem.
