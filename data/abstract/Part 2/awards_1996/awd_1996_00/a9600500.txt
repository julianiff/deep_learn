Abstract    :
              9600500  Trautmann  The 1996 Nuclear Chemistry Gordon Research Conference will 
              provide an international community of nuclear scientists with a  forum for the
              exhibition of the newest development at the  forefront on nuclear reactions
              initiated by heavy-ion beams.  The  discussions will emphasize reaction
              mechanisms including low-  energy fusion, incomplete fusion, deep-inelastic
              reactions,  multifragmentation, the formation and decay of hot and/or 
              compressed hadronic matter, and particle production in  relativistic and
              ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions.  ***
