Abstract    :
              9600383  Reynolds    This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. William 
              Reynolds of the Department of Materials Science and  Engineering at Virginia
              Tech and Dr. Kazuhiro Hono of the  Computational Materials Science Division of
              the National  Research Institute for Metals (NRIM). Project funding will 
              enable Dr. Reynolds to spend one year in Japan, resident at  NRIM, in order to
              study the interfacial chemistry of  precipitates in metals using atom
              probe/field ion  microscopy.  Dr.  Reynolds has previously studied 
              thermodynamic and crystallographic aspects of phase  transformations in metals.
               Dr. Hono has applied atom  probe/field ion microscopy to study the chemistry
              of  aluminum alloys, ferrous alloys, and magnetic materials at  the atomic
              scale.  Dr. Reynolds will combine his expertise  with that of Dr. Hono to study
              the influence of atomic-scale  chemistry on precipitate growth and  stability. 
                This proposal brings together research scientists from two  countries working
              in the area of physical metallurgy and  phase transformations.  The U.S.
              scientist will have the  opportunity to become familiar with research
              techniques,  equipment, and facilities at NRIM while contributing to the 
              overall research effort.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills  the objectives of
              the Program in its exchange and transfer  of scientific knowledge through an
              international  collaboration.  ***
