Abstract    :
              9600460  Mumby    This grant is for support for a FASEB summer conference on 
              protein phosphatases.  This conference includes sessions on  phosphatase
              structure, phosphatases in signal transduction,  genetic studies, and the role
              of phosphatases in cell  adhesion.   The addition and removal of phosphatases 
              are  important in many signaling pathways, but the research  emphasis has been
              greater on the phosphorylation studies.  This is one of the few meetings
              devoted to phosphatases, and  the topics are  current and address new
              interactions.   The  format of the meeting is conducive to interchange of ideas
               among participants.  ***
