Abstract    :
              9600016  Ellis    Donald Ellis and John Ketterson of Northwestern University
              will  collaborate with workers at the Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Fisicas 
              (CBPF), led by Elisa Baggio-Saitovitch. They will use state-of-the-art 
              computational and experimental techniques at each institution to model  and
              perform in situ experimental studies of the magnetic response of  thin metallic
              films and multilayers.  The exceptional characteristics of  synchrotron
              radiation will be exploited to study the evolution of the  overall magnetic
              response of thin magnetic layers and multilayers as a  function of their local
              and global environment.  As part of the  investigation, the technique of
              synchrotron Moessbauer spectroscopy will  be developed and applied, perfecting
              a new and speedy technique for  materials science at large.      This
              international collaboration builds on over 10 years of cooperative  effort and
              research, moving through several phases of theoretical and  experimental work. 
              CBPF has in the last few years received funding to  build a Magnetic Film
              Laboratory, now providing extensive capabilities  for vapor deposition of
              ordered and amorphous films, x-ray  characterization, and Moessbauer, NMR and
              perturbed angular correlation  spectroscopy.      ****
