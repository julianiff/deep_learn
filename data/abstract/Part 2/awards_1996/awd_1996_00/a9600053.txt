Abstract    :
              Stacey  96-00053  The International Symposium on Molecular Plant-Microbe
              Interactions will convene for the eighth time in 1996.  The meeting will be
              held in Knoxville, Tennessee from July 14-19, 1996.  The Symposium is being
              held under the auspices of the International Society if Molecular Plant-Microbe
              Interactions (ISMPMI).  The faculty of the Center for Legume Research at the
              University of Tennessee is serving as the local organizing committee.  A
              program is being developed in conjunction with the officers and board of the
              ISMPMI, as well as a distinguished International Advisory Board.  This
              symposium held on a biennial basis is generally considered the premier meeting
              in which to present research results pertaining to the molecular biology of
              plant-microbe interactions.  Funds are requested to offset speaker costs and to
              provide fellowship money for  graduate students, scientists from developing
              countries, and faculty and students from Historically Black Colleges and
              Universities.
