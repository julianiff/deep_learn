Abstract    :
              9600165  Mark    This three year award supports collaboration on novel 
              polymeric materials between James Mark, University of  Cincinnati, and Pham Huu
              Ly, Institute of Chemistry,  National Center for Natural Science and
              Technology, Hanoi,  Vietnam.  The proposed research will investigate the 
              reinforcement of natural rubber, a common substance in  Vietnam and therefore
              of great interest to researchers  there.  The proposed research is of
              fundamental and  practical interest to the US as well. The primary general 
              goal is to apply some of the latest processing technologies  to natural rubber,
              and to other natural resources, to  produce modern, high-performance materials.
               The potential  for producing more environmentally benign materials is an 
              important implication of this research. This mutually  beneficial choice of
              research topics seems well-suited for  the early stages of cooperation with
              Vietnam.    The National Center for Natural Science and Technology in  Vietnam
              is the premiere research arm of the government..  Because natural rubber is so
              important to Vietnam, there has  been a relatively well-funded research effort
              in polymer  science at the Institute of Chemistry.  This proposal draws  on
              experience gained by the PI in earlier interaction with  Dr. Ly, on common
              research interests, and on complementary  expertise. Plans call for training of
              a Vietnamese  researcher at the University of Cincinnati, and for  exchanges of
              research visits.
