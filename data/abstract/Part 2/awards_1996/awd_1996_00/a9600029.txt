Abstract    :
              9600029  Dixon  Alternation between explosive and non-explosive eruptive modes
              at Mt. Pelee provides an excellent natural example to study the relationship
              between volatiles and eruptive mechanism.  Accordingly, this project will test
              quantitatively the hypothesis of Smith and Roobol (1990a), which state that the
              main control on eruptive style of Mt. Pelee is not magma composition but gas
              content:  volatile-rich magma generate explosive Plinian activity and
              volatile-poor magma generates Pelean activity.  This will be accomplished by
              measuring the contents of pre-eruptive volatiles (H2O, CO2, Cl, F, and S) using
              microinfrared spectroscopy and electron and secondary ion mass spectrometry
              microscopy (ion probe) on juvenile glasses and melt inclusions in phenocrysts
              from both Plinian and Pelean deposits of Mt. Pelee.  Trace elements will be
              measured using an ion microprobe.  The evolution and degassing history of the
              volatiles will be interpreted within a framework of fractional crystallization
              models based on major and trace elements and open versus closed system
              degassing models.
