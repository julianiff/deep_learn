Abstract    :
              INT 9600679  Bansil        This U.S.-Czech materials research project between
              Dr. Rama Bansil of Boston University and Dr. Cestmir Konak of the Institute of
              Macromolecular Chemistry will examine microphase separation phenomena in
              several copolymer systems, including block, graft, random, and random
              multiblock copolymers.  To do so, the researchers intend to combine techniques
              of time-resolved small angle light scattering (SALS) with time-resolved small
              angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) to perform a systematic examination of microphase
              separation kinetics and structure in block copolymers. Their objective is to
              determine which features of the phase separation process are universal and
              which depend on specific chemical interactions.  Findings should improve our
              basic understanding of the relationship between the structure of polymers and
              their specific interactions with solvents.  Results may have technological
              applications in areas such as adhesives, emulsifiers, and barrier materials.   
              This project in polymers research fulfills the program objective of advancing
              scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Eastern
              Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas
              of strong mutual interest and competence.       ??
