Abstract    :
              9600017  Macek       A number of projects involving the correlated motion of 
              three particles of arbitrary mass and charge will be undertaken.  The mode of
              attack is based on a recently developed integral  expression which has been
              evaluated using complex variable  theory.  Emphasis is on the confrontation of
              theory and  experiment to test the physical pictures of correlated motion 
              which have arisen in diverse fields such as ion-atom  interactions, electron
              impact and photon processes.  ***
