Abstract    :
              9600275  Iuliucci      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour  months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit which will support Dr. Robbie J. Iuliucci to work
              with  Professor B. H. Meier at the University of Nijmegen in the  Netherlands. 
                    The aim of this project is to study the 3D structural  aspects of
              molecules and their interaction in the solid  phase via Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR).  The most useful  NMR interactions for this purpose in spin
              1/2 systems are  chemical shielding and dipolar interactions.  Dr. Iuliucci's 
              background is in chemical shift anisotropy and Dr. Meier's  expertise is with
              polarization transfer experiments.  Together they will advance the
              understanding of solid state  NMR.  The University of Nijmegan's lab had two
              new solid  state NMR spectrometers working at 400 MHz and 300 MHz and  has
              access to a 180 MHz solid state spectrometer and a 500,  600 and 750 MHz Bruker
              spectrometers with solids  capabilities.  In addition, they have numerous NMR
              probes,  including high spinning speed double and triple magic angle  spinning,
              probes, high field static cross polarization,  probes, a double rotation,
              probe, and a dynamic angle  spinning, probe, that enable most solid state NMR 
              experiments.  ***
