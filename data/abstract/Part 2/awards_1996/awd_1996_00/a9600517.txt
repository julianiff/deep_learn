Abstract    :
              9600517  Lavernia    This Americas Program award will support collaborative 
              research between Dr. Enrique Lavernia of the University of  California at
              Irvine, and Dr. Jose Luis Estrada of the  Instituto Politecnico Nacional (IPN)
              in Mexico. The project  objective is to conduct research in the development of
              AlSi  alloy metal matrix composites (MMCs) with combinations of  mechanical
              properties suitable for structural applications.  Many of these applications
              are of interest to the aerospace  and automobile industries.    The proposed
              work will involve a novel synthesis approach,  spray deposition, that will be
              used to prepare the MMCs.  The collaboration will involve the extensive
              facilities and  expertise of the Mexican side pertaining to the 
              microstructural characterization and mechanical testing of  MMCs, with the
              comprehensive characterization and modeling  resources related to the
              processing of MMCs of the  University of California group.  ***
