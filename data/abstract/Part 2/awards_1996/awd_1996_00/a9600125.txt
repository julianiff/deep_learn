Abstract    :
              9600125  McBay    This project will continue to provide experiences in the
              Federal  sector for five undergraduate students.  Participating students  will
              spend 10 weeks in the Washington, DC area during the summer of  1996 and return
              to their home institutions for additional  experiences during the academic
              year.  Experiences for the students  during the summer include: a two-day
              pre-internship placement; and  a two-day post-internship reflection period. 
              During the nine-week  period, interns will be guided by their mentors in the
              work  setting.  The post-internship period will take place at the QEM  offices
              and will involve students and their mentors.
