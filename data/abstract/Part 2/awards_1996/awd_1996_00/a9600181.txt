Abstract    :
              9600181  Smith    This U.S.-Brazil collaborative research project is led by 
              Ross Smith and Manoranjan Mitra of the University of Nevada  Reno in
              conjunction with  Jorge Rubio Rojas of the Federal  University of Rio Grande do
              Sul in Brazil.  The two groups  will unite their expertise to focus on the
              problems of  contamination of waters and soils by heavy metals, including 
              radio nuclides, oils, and other waste, making use of the  experience in
              phytoremediation for heavy metals of the U.S.  group and the use by the
              Brazilian group of hydrophobic  aquatic plants for removal of oils.  Mechanisms
              contributing  to metal ion or oil uptake will be studied in detail.  New 
              floatation techniques centering around variants of tall  column devices will
              also be expanded.    The work takes advantage of overlapping areas of expertise
               in the two countries and will contribute significantly to  the development of
              graduate students who will participate.  The support for the Brazilian team is
              provided by CNPq as  part of a bilateral U.S.-Brazil agreement.    ***
