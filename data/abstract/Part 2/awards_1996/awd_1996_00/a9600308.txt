Abstract    :
              9600308  Campbell    This award supports a 12 month Japan Society for the 
              Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr.  David Campbell at
              the Institute for Social Science,  University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. Dr.
              Campbell will work  with Dr. Masahiro Kawai, professor of economics, on a 
              research project entitled, "The Wealth and Income  Distribution of Saving: A
              Comparative Study of Japan and the  United States."    The proposed research
              will identify the socio-economic  groups which drive aggregate saving in Japan
              and the United  States and assess how these groups acquired their wealth. 
              Substantial empirical evidence exists that suggests that the  wealthy dominate
              aggregate saving in the United States and  that much of this wealth results
              from inheritances.  If this  result can be generalized to Japan  it would
              represent a  major difference in how we view aggregate saving.  Using 
              micro-data from the two wealth surveys previously conducted  in Japan, Dr.
              Campbell will compute the wealth and income  distributions of saving for the
              period 1988 to 1994 and  undertake a comparative analysis of the results with
              those  from the US.  The results of the analysis will provide  insight into
              current economic theory as it relates to saving  and practical suggestions for
              the creation of institutional  structures that encourage higher saving rates.
