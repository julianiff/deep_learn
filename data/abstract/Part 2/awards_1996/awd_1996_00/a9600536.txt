Abstract    :
              Abstract  9600536  Tyson      The cell division cycle is the periodic repetition
              of a sequence of events, including DNA synthesis, mitosis and cytokinesis, that
              transform a single cell into two daughter cells.  Control of the sequence and
              timing of these events is complex.  The major events are triggered by
              cyclin-dependent kinases, a family of enzymes whose activity depends on binding
              to the cyclin proteins, phosphorylation and binding to inhibitory proteins.  So
              far characterization of this regulatory system has been reductionistic;
              breaking the nnetwork into parts and examining how they interact.  This project
              will develop mathematical methods by which the parts can be put back together
              into a model of an intact, functional regulatory system.  By comparing the
              behavior of the model to experimental observations, the credibility of the
              model can be judged.  The goal is to develop realistic models of cell cycle
              control in frog embryos, yeast cells and mammalian cells.  The experimental
              tools to dissect this control system are well developed, but the theoretical
              tools necessary to put the pieces together are still largely untested and
              underappreciated by cell biologists.  This projects aims at developing
              appropriate mathematical tools, applying them to current data, and
              communicating the power of modeling the to the experimental community.   ***
