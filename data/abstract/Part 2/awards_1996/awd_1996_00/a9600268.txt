Abstract    :
              9600268  Wu    This award supports a 12 month Japan Science and Technology 
              Agency (STA) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Honglu Wu at  the National
              Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba,  Japan.  Dr. Wu will work with Dr.
              Y. Furusawa, head of Space  and Particle Radiation Research Group, on a
              research project  entitled, "Heavy Ion-Induced Chromosome Aberrations".    The
              proposed research will make use of the Heavy Ion Medical  Accelerator in Chiba
              (HIMAC) to study chromosome aberrations  in human cells, particularly human
              fibroblasts.  The major  objectives of this study are to analyze chromosome 
              aberrations using state-of-the-art techniques and to  investigate the effect of
              shielding in reducing biological  damage.  Results of the investigation will be
              useful for  NASA and the Japanese space agency to determine guidelines  for
              radiation protection in space missions, as well as for  understanding cancer
              incidence and cancer treatment with  heavy ion beams.  ***
