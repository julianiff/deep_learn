              This award supports research-agenda-building, research-coordination, and
              dissemination activities of one site of the National Center for Geographic
              Information and Analysis for a three-year period.  Substantively, activity will
              focus on three scientific areas, each of substantial importance to geography
              and the ability to analyze geographic data.  The first, cognitive models of
              geographic space, entails a set of research efforts to advance our
              understanding of how people conceptualize geographic spaces.  Such research is
              critical if we are to optimize the utility of computer technologies to
              represent and manipulate geographic data.  The second area, computational
              implementations of geographic concepts, aims to allow researchers to build
              computational models of geographic spaces and of the social and environmental
              processes which operate in them.  The third research area is called geographies
              of the information society, and entails conceptualization and investigation of
              the effects of emerging information and communications technologies on the
              geography (location and interaction) individuals, organizations, and societies.
               Activities will center on the development of targeted research topics, calling
              of specialist meetings, solicitation of proposals for very small seed grants
              for the development of larger research proposals, and dissemination of agendas,
              results, and educational materials.  The Center will remain a focal point for
              research and curricular development in geographic analysis.
