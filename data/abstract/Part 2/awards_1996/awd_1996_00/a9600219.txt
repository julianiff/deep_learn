Abstract    :
              This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              the University of Georgia.  The student will study the ethnobotanical knowledge
              of a forest-dwelling group in the Venezuelan Amazon, and will document the ways
              the community exploits, cognizes, and constructs symbolic and spiritual
              meanings for the vegetable resources in their environment.  The hypothesis to
              be tested is that the predominantly foraging communities have a less developed
              knowledge of their botanical environment than do fully horticultural peoples.
              The reasons advanced in the literature are that the increased knowledge
              functions as insurance against crop failure; that more sedentary residence
              allows greater knowledge; and that human disturbance actually augments local
              biodiversity.  The project will examine these hypotheses through this test
              case, and the degree of ethnobotanical knowledge of this group will be compared
              against that of other native Amazonian groups in the literature.  This project
              is important because it will add to our knowledge about the rapidly
              disappearing tropical forest of this region, as well as advance our
              understanding of how people construct cultural images and understandings of the
              natural world.  In addition it will add understanding of this important region
              of the world to our nation's knowledge base.
