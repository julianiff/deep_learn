Abstract    :
              9600387  Austin      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour  months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Amy T. Austin to work with Professor
              Osvaldo E.  Sala at the Universidad de Buenos Aires in Argentina.  Dr. Austin
              and Professor Sala will be doing research on  controls on biogeochemical
              processes.  They will establish a  set of experiments along a Patagonian
              precipitation gradient  in the range from 100 mm to 2000 mm annual rainfall at
              the  latitude of 45 degrees S at Rio Mayo.  They will establish  five sites in
              the different vegetation types of desert,  steppe, grassland, open and closed
              forest.  In each of the  sites they will measure the above ground net primary 
              productivity (ANPP), decomposition, and soil nutrient  availability, in an
              effort to understand the effect of  changing water availability on carbon and
              nutrient cycling.  An understanding of the effect of the processes could be a 
              fundamental step toward ameliorating human-induced  desertification.    ***
