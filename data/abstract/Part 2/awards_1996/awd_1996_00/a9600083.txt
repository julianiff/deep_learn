Abstract    :
              The number field sieve is the latest algorithm for factoring  integers into
              primes. The investigator will continue his research  into the speed of the
              number field sieve. The plan is first, to  study the precise distribution of
              certain vectors constructed in  the number field sieve; second, to  develop
              tools to analyze the  probability that vectors chosen from a  non-uniform
              distributimn  will be independent; third, combine these results to sharpen the 
              known heuristics for the time taken by the number field sieve.  The
              investigator will also consider various problems in  multiprecision arithmetic
              from a geometric viewpoint.  This  research falls into the general mathematical
              field of Number  Theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the study
              of  the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing  with the
              divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is  among the oldest branches
              of mathematics and  was pursued for  many centuries for purely aesthetic
              reasons. However, within  the  last half century it has become an indispensable
              tool in diverse   applications in areas such as data transmission and
              processing,  and  communication systems.
