Abstract    :
              9600468  Candel    This Americas Program award will support cooperative 
              research between Dr. Albert Candel, University of Chicago,  and Dr. Raul
              Quiroga Barranco of the Escuela Superior de  Fisica y Matematicas, Instituto
              Politecnico Nacional, (IPN),  in Mexico.    The goal of this project is to
              study homomorphisms of  specific topological spaces with various differential 
              geometry properties.  Specifically, the researchers are  interested in foliated
              manifolds for which there are  geometric structures either along the leaves or
              in the  transverse direction.  A compact foliated manifold with such 
              structures can be considered an adequate candidate to extend  various theorems
              concerning rigid geometric structures,  establishing, in the process,
              Mostow-Margulis type rigidity  results for foliations.  In these
              considerations, the  fundamental group and the stretch of a foliation will play
               an important role.  ***
