Abstract    :
              9600217  Lipschutz        This proposal requests travel funds to support a joint
               research project concerning computation in finitely  presented groups between
              Seymour Lipschutz, Temple  University, and Shi Wujie, Southwest China Normal 
              University.  Plans include participation of US students in  the research visits
              to China.    This research is aimed at improving the computational 
              infrastructure for science and engineering.  China has  emphasized
              computational algebra and it is expected that  this joint research will advance
              US interests in an  important area of computation research.
