Abstract    :
              9600232  Redner    This Americas Program award will support collaborative 
              research between Dr. Sydney Redner, Boston University, and  Dr. Francois
              Leyvraz, UNAM, Cuernavaca, Mexico, on the  dynamics and resulting spatial
              organization of dilute  inelastic gases.  The project has three distinct parts:
               development of qualitative methods to understand the  dynamics and clustering
              phenomena of inelastic gases,  studies of the spatio-temporal behavior of a
              simple  exothermic reaction model, and introduction and  investigation of
              simple models of cooperative and  competitive behavior that may lead to
              analytic advances.    The problems to be studied are relevant to current
              studies  in the theory of complex, non-linear systems.  The research  will lead
              to significant increases in our understanding of  important technological
              processes and involves novel models  that are of interest and potential
              relevance to the social  sciences as well.  ***
