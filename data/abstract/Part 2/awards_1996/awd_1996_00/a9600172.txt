Abstract    :
                This three-year award supports ongoing U.S.-U.K. research  collaboration in
              neutron scattering studies of quantum  liquids between Paul Sokol of
              Pennsylvania State University  and W. G. Stirling of the University of Keele. 
              The  objective of their research is to conduct neutron scattering  studies of
              microscopic statics and dynamics of quantum  liquids and solids in a variety of
              different environments.  Energy inelastic, quasi-elastic and elastic neutron 
              scattering techniques will be applied to quantum liquids and  solids,
              particularly liquid helium.  The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration
              expertise  in high energy neutron scattering, spallation sources, and 
              numerical simulations of instrumental resolution.  This is  complemented by the
              British investigator's experience in the  measurement of collective excitations
              and with instruments  at reactor sources.  Measurements will be carried out at 
              neutron scattering facilities in the U.S. and Europe,  including the ISIS
              Spallation Source at Rutherford Appleton  Laboratory in the United Kingdom and
              the Institut Laue  Langevin in France.
