Abstract    :
              9600348  Daughton      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour  months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Alan R. Daughton to work with Dr. Henri 
              Waelbroeck at Instituto de Ciencias Nucleares, UNAM in  Mexico City, Mexico.   
                  Dr. Daughton has been invited to visit the Department of  Gravitation and
              Field Theory of Universidad Nacional  Autonoma to establish a collaboration in
              the field of  discrete quantum gravity.  That department is pursuing three 
              different lines of research:  the interpretation problems,  specifically the
              "problem of time"; the mathematics of  quantum groups and their implications as
              to the structure of  spacetime; and discrete models of quamtum gravity.  The 
              institute has a Sun system built around a Sparcsystem 1000.  In addition to Dr.
              Waelbroeck, Dr. Daughton will be working  with Professor Rafael Sorkin, who
              will be working on a  causal set program.      ***
