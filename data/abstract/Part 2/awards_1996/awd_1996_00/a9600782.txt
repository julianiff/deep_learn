                                   PI:  Koenig  Proposal Number:  9600793    Support is
              requested for young American scientists who would like to attend the
              International Society for Behavioral Ecology (ISBE) meeting to be held in
              Canberra, Australia, 29  September-4 October 1996, hosted by Andrew Cockburn
              and the Australian National University.  This biennial conference is open to
              all those interested in behavioral ecology.  It is held in alternate years from
              the International Ethological Conference (IEC) and is the primary international
              gathering of scientists focusing on the ecological correlates of behavior in an
              evolutionary framework.  The meeting brings together workers from a variety of
              countries and offers an  unparalleled opportunity for young American behavioral
              ecologists to meet colleagues in the Australiasian region, share their work
              with an international audience, and become introduced to Australia's unique
              biota and its associated conservation problems.
