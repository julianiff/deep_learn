Abstract    :
              9600313  Borg      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-  four months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. John P. Borg to work with Dr. Mike Gaster
              at  the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom.        This research
              will serve to extend non-obtrusive near wake  control techniques over circular
              cylinders at or near  critical Reynolds numbers (65<Re<1200).  In so doing,
              this  research will advance the fundamental understanding of  transition,
              including location, causality and mechanisms.  This research hopes to locate
              and identify the origin of a  secondary vortex system, believed to be
              Tollmien-Schlichting  waves, and the corresponding critical points, which are 
              believed to form in the near wake and result in roll-up of  the primary vortex.
               Pneumatic control ports in the shear  layer and spanwise acoustic excitation
              are proposed to  hinder the growth of the secondary system and extend  critical
              Reynolds beyond current limits.  In addition, a  dynamical system is proposed
              to describe the interaction of  both the primary and secodary vortex system. 
              Such a system  is to be used to develop an analytical model of transitional 
              and turbulence.    ***
