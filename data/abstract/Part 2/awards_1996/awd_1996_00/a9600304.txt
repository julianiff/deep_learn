Abstract    :
              9600304  Earle    This award supports a 12 month Japan Society for the 
              Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr.  Paul Earle at the
              Earthquake Research Institute, University  of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.  Dr. Earle
              will work with Dr. Yoshio  Fukao, director of the Earthquake Research
              Institute, on a  research project entitled, "The Teleseismic Survey of the 
              Upper-Mantle Reflectivity Structure Beneath the Mid-Atlantic  Region."    The
              proposed research will determine the sharpness (depth  extent) and topography
              (depth variations) of seismic  discontinuities occurring at average depths of
              410- and 660-  km.  At present, seismic stations located in Japan form part  of
              a unique geometry for studying the discontinuity  structure below the
              Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  Energy originating  from earth-quakes in the Tonga and New
              Hebridies trenches  reflects from discontinuities beneath the Mid-Atlantic
              Ridge  before arriving in Japan.  This energy is recorded on two  Japanese
              seismic arrays: the J-array (over 300 short-period  seismometers blanketing
              Japan) and POSEIDON (a network of  more than 30 modern broadband seismometers
              located in and  surrounding the Japanese islands).  The research will use 
              seismograms from earthquakes of magnitude > 5.6 occurring  after April 1991
              (birth of the J-array) to examine seismic  wave arrivals which have interacted
              with seismic  discontinuities.  Drs. Fukao and Earle will develop  automated
              methods to analyze over 70,000 seismograms  contained in this data base.  Array
              processing techniques  will aid in the positive identification of these small 
              amplitude reflections and will be used to place constraints  on the Earth's
              chemical composition, temperature variations,  and the nature of material flow
              within it.  ***
