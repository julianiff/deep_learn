Abstract    :
              9600171    Persons coping with physical disability face certain "social
              handicaps" above and beyond their physical limitation.  Often persons coping
              with physical disability are stigmatized, in that they are perceived to be
              incompetent in areas unaffected by their specific physical disability.  Two
              theoretical explanations suggest that competing mechanisms account  for the
              spread of stigma:  (1) the presence of a stigma may overwhelm all other aspects
              of an individual's social identity and  becomes the only status cue used to
              characterize the individual's social  standing in a group or (2) physical
              disability may combine with other   relevant status cues to form a composite
              assessment of an individual's competency.  This Dissertation Improvement
              research investigates experimentally the presence of a physical disability
              along with other relevant status cues to determine which of  these two
              interpretations best models the social effects of physical disability. 
              Participants consist of freshmen females at a large university who sign up to
              participate in the experiments.  Once in the laboratory, participants will be
              exposed to videos of "partners on a decision making project."  These partners
              will be either portrayed as deaf or hearing and having high, equivalent or low
              status relative to the particpants.  The results of the proposed study will (1)
              enhance our understanding of the social effects of physical disability; (2)
              combine relevant research in group processes and disability studies; and (3)
              suggest possible intervention strategies to alleviate the social handicaps
              encountered by persons coping with physical disability.  ****
