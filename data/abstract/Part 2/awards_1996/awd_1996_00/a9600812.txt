Abstract    :
              9600812  Bullitt     This is Research Planning Grant for Women Scientists and
              Engineers.  The spindle pole body (SPB) is the microtubule organizing center of
              yeast. Nuclear and cytoplasmic microtubules originate at the SPB, and thus this
              complex structure plays a significant role in regulation of cell cycle.  The
              power genetic tools available for yeast, and the reduced number of microtubules
              in the mitotic spindle (<50, versus thousands in mammalian centrosomes) make
              the yeast an excellent system for studying the central question of how cells
              utilize microtubule organizing centers for all aspects of cell division. 
              Transmission electron microscopy and image processing will be used to determine
              the three-dimensional structure of the core portion, and to assess any
              underlying symmetries.  The SPB core is obtained by brief treatment of isolated
              SPBs with heaprin, which disassembles the microtubules and removes the outer
              and inner plaques of the SPB, leaving intact the central plaque and attached
              filamentous structures.  The presence of symmetry will be assessed, and, if
              applicable, used in three-dimensional tomographic reconstructions from tilt
              series data.  The research to be conducted during the planning grant period
              will provide the basis for more detailed structural studies of the yeast
              spindle pole body.  The objective is an understanding of the relationship
              between structure and function of microtubule organizing centers.  ***
