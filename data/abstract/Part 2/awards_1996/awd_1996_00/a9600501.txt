Abstract    :
              96------  VanDecar    This U.S.-Mexico Planning Visit will provide travel
              support  to Drs. John C. VanDecar and Sean C. Solomon of Carnegie  Institution
              of Washington so that they may participate in  project SAMPLE Jalisco (Seismic
              Analysis of Micro-Plate  Evolution, Jalisco, Mexico).  This project will
              provide  understanding of fundamental scientific questions which  concern the
              evolution of the Jalisco area, as well as other  plate boundaries.  The Jalisco
              area at this particular time  will act as a natural laboratory to study the
              forces that  have shaped the west coast of North America in its  transition
              from subduction to transform motion.    The collaborator on the Mexican side,
              Dr. Gerardo Suarez at  Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, is being
              supported  by NSF's counterpart agency, CONACYT.    Both sides will place
              seismometers in the field, return  periodically to service the network, and
              finally, analyze  the data.  ***
