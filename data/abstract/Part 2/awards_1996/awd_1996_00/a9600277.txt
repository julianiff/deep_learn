Abstract    :
              9600277  Srivastava    This U.S.-Brazil cooperative research effort will be led
              by  Santosh Srivastava at California Institute of Technology and  the Jet
              Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Lee Mu-Tao of the  Universidade Federal de Sao
              Carlos in Brazil.  They will  collaborate on studies related to electron
              collision  properties of atoms and molecules of interest to planetary  and
              astrophysical environments and to the semiconductor  industry. Accurate
              knowledge of electron collision cross  sections for more complex molecules than
              previously studied  is necessary for understanding the plasmas found in outer 
              space and those used in the semiconductor industry.    The principals in this
              project are already funded in their  respective countries for carrying out
              cross section  measurements, and the laboratories involved have  collaborated
              productively in the past.  A new state-of-the  art laboratory in Sao Carlos and
              several students will  contribute significantly to the effectiveness of the
              team.  Part of the funding for this project will be provided by the  Atomic,
              Molecular, and Optical Program of the Physics  Division at NSF.      ****
