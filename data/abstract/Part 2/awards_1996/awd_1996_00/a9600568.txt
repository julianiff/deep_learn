Abstract    :
              IBN 9600568   Kenneth R. Robinson, P.I.    A central problem of developmental
              biology is how pattern emerges from the relatively unpatterned state of the
              egg. The eggs of the brown algae are especially useful for the approaching this
              problem because they are completely unpatterned at the time of fertilization.
              These cells respond to unilateral blue light by forming their primary
              developmental axis and germinating away from the light source. Our research
              aims to understand the mechanisms whereby the cells convert the light signal to
              a localized growth response. Preliminary results indicate that a small, soluble
              molecule, cyclic GMP, is produced in response to light and somehow directs the
              later events. We will carry out experiments to test this hypothesis and will
              use antibodies to map the distribution of cyclic GMP in cells that have been
              exposed to light. It is remarkable that these lower plants seem to use a
              sensory mechanism that is closely related to that used by the vertebrate eye
              for detecting light. The next step will be to understand how the cyclic GMP
              changes are coupled to the later events. There is evidence that calcium ions
              are involved, so we will attempt to map the distribution of calcium in
              responding cells. Finally, we will explore the possible downstream targets of
              calcium. A calcium-binding protein called calmodulin appears to be involved and
              we will test this idea. Also, the plant version of the muscle protein, actin,
              has been shown to necessary for germination, so we will study the regulation of
              that protein by calcium.
