              9600408  Dowd        This award will provide phase-out funds so that the 
              participation of this group in exotic quark searches at the  Brookhaven
              Multiparticle Spectrometer can occur in an  orderly fashion.  Support is
              provided for a research  associate for 2 months, and for completion of work by
              1  graduate and 2 undergraduate students.  ***
