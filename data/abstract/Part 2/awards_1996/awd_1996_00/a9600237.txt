Abstract    :
                This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research between the
              PATH project of the University of California at Berkeley, led by Pravin
              Varaiya, and the SPECTRE project of INRIA (French National Institute for
              Research in Informatics and Applied Mathematics) led by Joseph Sifakis of
              INRIA/Rhone-Alpes. The objective of the PATH project is to design automated
              highway systems so that capacity and safety of surface transportation are
              increased substantially.  This project is part of the Federal Highway
              Authority's Intelligent Transportation Systems Program.  SPECTRE's objectives
              are to (1) design and develop programming languages for concurrent and
              real-time systems; (2) define and study models and specification languages; and
              (3) design and implement validation techniques adapted to specification
              languages.  The objective of the proposed collaboration is to apply techniques
              in hybrid systems theory and  verification tools to PATH's design of automated
              highway systems.    The U.S. groups brings to this collaboration their
              expertise in theory for hybrid control and verification and a test environment,
              the automated highway systems project. This is complemented by the control and
              verification tools developed by French group at INRIA.  The project is expected
              to advance our understanding of hybrid systems theory and verification tools.
