Abstract    :
              9600327  Larson      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour  months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. David J. Larson to work with Dr. Alfred
              Cerezo  at the University of Oxford on a project entitled, "Specimen 
              Fabrication and Atom Probe Analysis of Metallic Multilayer  Thin Film
              Structures."        The objective of this project is to correlate interfacial 
              structure with magnetic properties in multilayer films. This  will be done by
              1) development of a specimen preparation  technique for multilayer film (MLF)
              structures which allows  atom probe analysis when the film normal is parallel
              to the  tip axis and the films have not been prepared by sputtering  or
              evaporating onto a highly curved sample and 2) atom probe  field ion microscopy
              (APFIM) characterization of MLF  structure for the purpose of correlating
              deposition and  processing conditions with interfacial structure and 
              ultimately, with magnetic properties.  This correlation will  allow
              optimization and reproducibility of the most important  magnetic properties of
              MLFs for commercial applications.    ***
