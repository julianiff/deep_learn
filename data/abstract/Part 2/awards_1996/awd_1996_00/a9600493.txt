Abstract    :
              Yasbin  9600493  Support is provided for the Wind River Conference on
              Procaryotic Biology to be held June 5-9, 1996, in Estes Park, Colorado.  This
              conference is primarily concerned with the biology of a variety of prokaryotic
              and lower eukaryotic systems.  It is the major annually occurring international
              meeting devoted to this subject area and is often where new "emerging" genetic
              systems are first described.  The meeting has always been open to all
              researchers working in the field of genetic exchange and related areas,
              including DNA repair, restriction-modification systems and recombination
              pathways.  A major strength of the meetings has been the diversity of genetic
              systems represented; this diversity has provided a fertile environment for new
              ideas, and for applying well-established concepts to newly emerging genetic
              systems.  Historically, a significant feature of these meetings has been their
              accessibility to graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.  Support is being
              provided for those young researchers who demonstrate need and are presenting
              work at the meeting.  Research discussed at this meeting is important because
              of the applications of research in microbial genetics and physiology to
              biotechnology.  ***
