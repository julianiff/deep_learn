Abstract    :
              9600525  Buechtemann    This research project uses the opportunity of a new
              projection facility in the United States by Mercedes-Benz to examine questions
              of the basic skills and aptitudes of the US labor force for manufacturing jobs
              and the role of the systematic worker selection for high performance
              manufacturing. It examines the role of the formal workforce training and
              apprenticeship school and business partnerships in generating the human capital
              pre requisites and technical skills base for modern production systems. Also it
              examines the transferability of elements of the German "dual" apprenticeship
              system for high level technical training to the US and the need for their
              adaptation to the specific US social environment; and the selection of
              workforce for highly technical training.    The analysis will be conducted
              between 1996 and 1998 and will involve collection of quantitative and
              qualitative empirical information of the new production site in Alabama and
              from regional education providers and also from comparable sites of the parent
              company in Germany. Thus, the analysis plan is longitudinal (follows teams) and
              cross-national comparative. This project is part of a large research effort to
              study the technological, organizational, and human resources of the creation of
              a local capability base for high performance manufacturing work settings.  ***
