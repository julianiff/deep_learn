Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to continue an REU Site at the University of Minnesota
              Center for Research in Learning, Perception, and Cognition.  Ten students each
              year, over a three year period, will be selected for eight week sessions in the
              summer to work with cognitive science faculty affiliated with the Center.  The
              majority of the students will be selected from small liberal arts colleges in
              the upper midwest with limited research opportunities.  Students will: (1) work
              as full members of their faculty mentor's research team; (2) complete a
              research project including a written report and oral presentation to peers and
              faculty; (3) participate in a multidisciplinary research training seminar for
              credit; and (4) participate in a special non-credit 'Master Student' course. 
              Seminar activities will include presentations by program faculty and faculty in
              related areas campus-wide, laboratory tours, and lectures on research tools,
              design, and ethics.  The fully integrated program will include opportunities
              for the students to learn specific research methods, to apply these methods in
              the context of their own research, and to examine broad conceptual and
              methodological issues relating to the cognitive sciences.  This award
              contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students
              into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.
