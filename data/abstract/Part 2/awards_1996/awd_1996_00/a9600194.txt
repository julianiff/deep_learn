Abstract    :
              9600194  Hartenstein    The studies proposed here are focused on the so-called 
              early genes  which are important for the development of the adult and larval
              visual system in Drosophila.  This system provides an excellent preparation
              with which to analyze the action of genes in the developing nervous system. 
              The genes in question have been cloned and their molecular characterization has
              been completed.  The particular focus  is the role of the sine oculis,  eyes
              absent, and eyeless  genes.  Homologs of some of the genes occur in vertebrates
              and so appear to have  fundamental  roles in the development of diverse eyes. 
              The results of the proposed experiments will shed light on the genetic
              mechanism which controls the determination step in which the embryonic
              progenitor cell adopts a particular developmental fate, and which orchestrates
              the progenitor cell?s transition from an early proliferative phase to the phase
              of differentiation..
