Abstract    :
                   We propose to investigate a number of topics in theoretical  physics.  One
              concerns the origin of the violation of time-  reversal symmetry, one of the
              greatest mysteries in physics, and  observed in decays of the K-meson.  The
              nature of this violation  isn't well understood.  A particular rare decay of
              the K-meson is  extremely sensitive to time-reversal violation, but is very 
              difficult to detect.  Recently, it has been realized that it may  be measurable
              at TUNAF or BNL.  We plan to calculate the decay  rate in a wide variety of
              models of particle interactions.  Another topic concerns neutrinos scattering
              off the deuteron,  where more protons are produced in the forward direction
              than one  expects.  This is often attributed to rescattering in the  deuterium
              nucleus.  Relativistic effects also affect the  expectations, and we wish to
              determine the size of these effects.  This is the largest uncertainty in
              determining the reaction rate  of neutrinos off neutrons and protons.  Still
              another topic  concerns a popular theory in particle physics, based on 
              supersymmetry.  Although most new particles predicted by  supersymmetry are
              very heavy, there remains the possibility that  one, the gluino, is light, and
              detectable at TUNAF and/or BNL.  We've examined this previously and will work
              closely with  experimenters in planned searchers.
