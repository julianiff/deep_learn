Abstract    :
              9600892  Grodzicker    Study of the biological bases of learning and memory is 
              among the most exciting fields in neuroscience.  Progress is  currently very
              rapid, particularly at molecular, cellular,  neural systems and computational
              levels.  Commonalities of  mechanisms appear to be emerging from studies of
              gene  expression, synaptic plasticity (LTP and LTD) and processes  of memory
              storage in invertebrate and vertebrate systems.  This meeting is planned to
              bring together representatives  from the major laboratories, along with a large
              number of  younger scientists, including may women, in all areas of  learning
              and memory research.  To achieve this requires  substantial funding.
