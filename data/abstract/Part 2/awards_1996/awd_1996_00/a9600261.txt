Abstract    :
              9600261  Baum    This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative  research
              project between Drs. Michael Baum, Boston  University, and Raul Paredes,
              Anahuac University, Mexico  City.  The researchers will study comparative
              aspects of  brain and behavioral sexual differentiation in two mammalian 
              species, the rat and the ferret.  The structure and function  of the brain
              circuit normally undergoes a degree of  masculinization in female rats as a
              consequence of prenatal  exposure of the female's brain to testosterone of
              placental  origin.  Normally, no such masculinization occurs in the  female
              ferret.  Experiments are proposed to treat animals  prenatally in order to
              determine whether circulating  androgens and/or estrogens during fetal
              development are the  cause of the more masculine behavior of female rats, and
              to  relate differences in sexual behavior to the functional  activation of
              neurons within regions of the brain that have  been sexually differentiated.   
              All the proposed studies involving ferrets will be done in  the Boston
              laboratory, while the comparative work with rats  will be done in the Mexican
              laboratory.  The results  obtained should improve our understanding of how sex 
              differences in pheromonal communication  develop in species  representing two
              different mammalian orders, and  will  provide basic information concerning the
              activational and  organizational effects of steroid hormones on chemosensory 
              systems important for reproduction.  ***
