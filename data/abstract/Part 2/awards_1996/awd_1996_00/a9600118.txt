Abstract    :
              9600118  Wright   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project from
              Consultec Scientific, Inc. seeks to develop a computer simulator that can be
              used in place of actual radiation sources.  The consequence of the availability
              of such a simulator will be a substantial reduction in the cost of training,
              provision for a wider variety of training situations, and elimination of the
              safety hazards associated with actual radiation sources.  Consultec Scientific
              proposes to build a computer system that will simulate the presence of various
              types of radiation sources in a variety of environments.  The Phase I effort
              showed that the concept of radiation calculations "on the fly" in a
              two-dimensional space is feasible.  The Surveyor module developed in Phase I
              allows a user to create a radiation environment on the computer screen and
              conduct a radiation "survey," interacting with software and hardware
              instruments.  The Phase II effort will make it possible to use the simulator in
              three-dimensional space.  The project will develop a wireless, hand-held
              version of the hardware instrument for untethered operation; incorporate a
              three-dimensional location detection system for location of the wireless
              hardware device; and create two other software modules (Radiation Physics
              Laboratory and Examiner).  These combined components will result in a
              comprehensive radiation simulator that will remove radioactive sources from the
              training environment and reduce the amount of radiation to which students and
              faculty are exposed.   This simulator is expected to have numerous commercial
              applications and to make a major impact on health physics training.  It will
              improve the efficiency and productivity of training activities in nuclear
              medicine, nuclear power production, nuclear research, nuclear weapon production
              and disposal, environmental restoration, and waste management.
