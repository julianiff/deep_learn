Abstract    :
                   One of the most fundamental questions in the field of  statistical
              mechanics is to explain the observed increase of a  system's entropy in an
              irreversible process in terms of the  underlying microscopic dynamics of the
              constituent particles.  Recent work in dynamical systems theory (often called
              `chaos`  theory) has allowed for considerable progress in this direction  and
              for quantitative predictions to be made for both the  quantities that describe
              the irreversible behavior of the system,  such as transport coefficients, as
              well as the quantities that  describe the system's chaotic behavior, such as
              Lyapunov  exponents and dynamical `entropies`.  The purpose of this  research
              is to apply techniques of statistical mechanics to  calculate both transport
              and dynamical quantities for systems of  physical interest, and to relate them
              to each other and, in some  cases, to the thermodynamic properties of the
              system.  This will  lead to a deeper understanding of the connections between
              the  Second Law and microscopic dynamics.  For quantum systems, this  will also
              lead to further understanding of the behavior of some  solid state devices of
              considerable current interest.
