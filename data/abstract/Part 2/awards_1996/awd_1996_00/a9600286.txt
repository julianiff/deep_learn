Abstract    :
              9600286  Kotiuga    This award supports a 6 month National Science Foundation 
              Dissertation Enhancement Award for Mr. Paul Gross at the  Central Research
              Laboratory, Hitachi, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan.  Mr. Gross will work with Dr. Ikuo
              Saitoh, senior research  scientist at CRL, on a research project entitled, "A 
              Software Implementation of an Algorithm to Make Cuts for  Magnetic Scalar
              Potentials Without Implicit Heuristic  Assumptions About Homotopy Groups".   
              The proposed research will develop practical and  computationally efficient
              solutions to problems related to 3-  D magnetoquasistatic electromagnetic field
              computation.  The  key problem to be addressed involves using a computer to 
              "cut" the finite element mesh of a 3-dimensional, multiply-  connected region
              so as to permit the computation of a  magnetic scalar potential in the
              nonconducting region of the  problem space.  The specific focus of the proposed
              research  will be on the creation of software algorithms so as to  increase the
              finite computations needed for the analysis,  the practical outcome being the
              development of a methodology  that reduces the design cycle time and costs of
              magnetic  devices.  ***
