Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Proposal: DMS-9600085  PI: Duren     In the area of Bergman spaces,
              Duren will continue his recent work by investigating properties of canonical
              divisors and their analogues in more general invariant subspaces.  Specific
              questions will   include structural properties of extremal functions and the
              determination of generators for invariant subspaces.  Also to be studied are
              sampling sequences and interpolation sequences in Bergman spaces.  For planar
              harmonic mappings, the project will investigate the connection between
              dilatation and boundary correspondence, will seek to develop improved forms of
              both the existence and uniqueness assertions in the harmonic version of the
              Riemann mapping theorem, and will continue a study of harmonic mappings of
              multiply connected domains.  Duren also plans to investigate a curvature
              problem for minimal surfaces and to make further studies of the connections
              between minimal surfaces and their underlying harmonic mappings.  Finally, a
              basic coefficient conjecture for harmonic mappings will be addressed.      
              Bergman spaces often arise in connection with complex analysis, approximation
              theory, and operator theory, so it is important to understand their structure. 
              Sampling sequences make contact with the   modern theory of wavelets, which has
              broad applications to image processing, signal analysis, and data storage. 
              Conformal mappings have long been used to change coordinates in solving
              problems of fluid flow, heat conduction, and the like.  Harmonic mappings are
              significant generalizations of conformal mappings which share some of their
              properties but present many new phenomena.  They are particularly useful in the
              study of minimal surfaces (area-minimizing surfaces), represented physically by
              soap films spanning loops of wire.
