Abstract    :
              9600645  Lacerda    This U.S.-Brazil planning grant will support a trip by Alex 
              Lacerda of Florida State University and the Los Alamos  National Laboratory to
              the Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil  to establish a collaboration with Nei
              Fernandes de Oliveira  Junior of the Instituto de Fisica of that institution.
              The  eventual objective will be to study the thermodynamic and  transport
              properties of Heavy Fermion (HF) and Kondo  Insulator (KI) compounds and to
              construct a miniaturized  plastic dilution refrigerator to operate in pulsed
              magnetic  fields to 60T.  The collaborators will also work with Milton 
              Torikachvili of San Diego State University in California,  where low-field
              thermodynamic and transport properties will  be studied.  Although these
              systems have been intensively  studied, the new project will provide needed
              data on  behavior at extreme conditions of magnetic fields and ultra  low
              temperatures.    The establishment of cooperation between the excellent  magnet
              facilities of Los Alamos Laboratory, the low  temperature expertise at Sao
              Paulo, and the experience in  sample preparation, magnetization and
              magnetotransport  measurements at San Diego State will produce a very high 
              capability for carrying out the proposed investigations. One  result should be
              a new and useful experimental apparatus to  serve the scientific community.
