Abstract    :
              9515389  Manchester    This award supports a joint US-China workshop on 
              paleobotanical research.  The workshop will be held in July  1996 in
              conjunction with the International Organization of  Paleobotany Conference.  An
              important objective of the  international conference is to encourage scientific
              and  professional interaction among paleobotanists from different  parts of the
              world studying a range of geologic times and  systematic groups. The US-China
              workshop will expand on the  conference objectives by providing a dedicated
              forum for  initiation of collaborative research between US and Chinese 
              scientists.  Workshop organizers have been careful to  structure the program to
              provide improved opportunities for  the participation of junior scientists from
              both countries.    Collaboration between the US and China will allow US 
              researchers  to probe striking similarities between the  fossil floras of
              Europe and North America, and those of  China. By combining efforts with
              Chinese paleobotanists, US  paleobotanists will be able to gain a better
              understanding  of the systematic affinities, stratigraphic ranges, and 
              biogeographic distribution of extinct plants.  ***
