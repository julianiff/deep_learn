Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop, demonstrate, assess, and refine a new
              approach to manufacturing education and training which promises to enhance the
              effectiveness of the manufacturing workforce across a broad range of technical
              expertise.  The heart of the effort is a computer-based dynamic simulation and
              visualization of the time-dependent behavior of chemical processes and
              associated equipment used to execute these processes in microelectronics
              manufacturing.  The simulations will begin with design, optimization, and
              control in the area of semiconductor manufacturing, and will then validate the
              elements that represent the physical and chemical behavior of semiconductor
              manufacturing equipment and processes.  The program includes simulator
              development and integration, manufacturing training modules, engineering design
              modules, and assessment and dissemination.  The long term goals are to provide
              a range of simulations that can be used for training industrial technicians,
              graduate engineers, and graduate students in the operation of the equipment
              being used in electronics ma nufacturing, and to allow research and development
              of new and/or improved manufacturing equipment.
