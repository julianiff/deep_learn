Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long term objective of Dr. Carrier's work is to develop an                 
              understanding of the mechanical and neurological linkage between               
              the locomotor and ventilatory systems. The aims of the present                 
              investigation is to increase our understanding of 1) the role                  
              that the axial musculo-skeletal system plays in locomotion, and                
              2) the mechanical linkage between the locomotor and ventilatory                
              systems. This is an N.S.F. Young Investigator Award.
