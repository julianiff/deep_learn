Abstract    :
              This award will be used to expand the Principal                                
              Investigator's (PI) current research program in                                
              cell-surface interactions into areas of application in                         
              tissue engineering.  The interaction of cells and tissues                      
              with polymeric material surfaces will be investigated at                       
              the molecular and cellular level, addressing both                              
              biomedical and biotechnological applications.  The PI plans                    
              to determine material surface properties and                                   
              surface-protein-cell interactions that lead to the desired                     
              protein, cell and tissue behavior.
