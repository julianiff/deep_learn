Abstract    :
              9418458  Pyle  Recent geophysical data suggest the Oregon Coast Range  reaches
              thicknesses as great as 30 km and its seismic  structure is similar to oceanic
              plateau, flood basalt  provinces.  Preliminary He analyses of olivine from an
              OCR  picrite indicate a deep mantle plume source.  The 3He/4He  ratios of an
              OCR picrite crushed  in vacuo (R/Ra > 13.0)  overlaps values found for Snake
              River Plain lavas and more  recent products of the Yellowstone hotspot.  Fusion
               experiments on this sample prove that the high 3He/4He ratio  is not
              cosmogenic, and is a signature of the mantle source  of the picrite. 
              Voluminous volcanism and high 3He/4He  ratios are intriguing evidence that the
              Yellowstone hospot  contributed to OCR volcanism, and therefore, has been
              active  since at least 64 Ma.  To further test this hypothesis, we  propose a
              combined Sr, Nd, Pb, Ar, He, and O isotopic study  of the OCR basalts.  We will
              focus on volcanic rocks from  the Roseburg and Siletz River formations to:  1)
              determine  the mantle source composition for these OCR basalts and  evaluate
              their relationship to the Yellowstone plume; 2)  constrain the age and duration
              of volcanism within the OCR.  We will also complete a detailed  major and trace
              element  study of the OCR to evaluate regional melting conditions  (depth and
              amount) to understand the spatial distributions  of possible tectonic settings.
