Abstract    :
              Emergency response professionals and disaster researchers agree                
              that emergency planning is an important precondition for                       
              effective community response to environmental emergencies.                     
              Unfortunately, hazard mitigation repeatedly has been found to be               
              a low priority activity because of perceptions of low hazard                   
              vulnerability and the high cost of hazard mitigation.  However,                
              local emergency planning committees (LEPCs) are a promising                    
              mechanism for promoting community emergency planning.  This study              
              will investigate the structure and planning effectiveness of such              
              organizations.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Results of this study will be relevant to planning for toxic                   
              chemical releases caused by natural hazards such as earthquakes                
              and industrial accidents.  In addition, the study results are                  
              expected to illuminate many important issues associated with                   
              community planning for a broad range of natural and technological              
              hazards.
