Abstract    :
              9319162  Watkins    This award provides expert help and staff support to further
              the  development and coordination of interagency activities related to  U.S.
              research in oceanography, global change activities, and  related research and
              technology.  This includes support for the  U.S. Global Change Research Program
              (USGCRP), especially with  respect to the preparation of documents for
              interagency use and  the dissemination of information on the USGCRP to the U.S.
               scientific community, federal planners, and other interested  parties,
              including the international community.  Additional  efforts include support for
              efforts to enhance cooperation  between NASA, NSF and the academic community
              relating to use of  satellite remote sensing in ocean science research plus 
              scientific assistance and coordination of research vessel  clearances for
              research projects in the exclusive economic zones  of other countries.   
              Financial support for the various activities is being provided by  NSF, NASA,
              ONR, Oceanographer of the Navy, and by interagency  USGCRP funds administered
              by NSF.
