Abstract    :
              9308663  Wang    This project deals with an efficient modeling, design and
              control  method for high speed flexible machines. Impacts within the 
              clearances of such devices can seriously degrade their  performance and
              generate excessive noise and vibration. In this  research program, the dynamic
              behavior of machines is modeled  incorporating design parameters such as link
              elasticity, link  lengths, clearance values, and material properties. Practical
               methods are developed to reduce and control the effects  clearances via
              optimal use of geometric and material properties;  an on-line technique for
              clearance estimation and diagnostics  using machine vibration response; and an
              innovative application  of piezoelectric actuators and sensors bonded to the
              machine  links to actively suppress clearance-induced vibration and impact 
              forces. A coordinate reduction procedure, in conjunction with the  methods of
              finite element and harmonic balance, are used to the  methods of finite element
              and harmonic balance, are used to  assist in arriving at optimal designs of
              flexible mechanisms.  ***
