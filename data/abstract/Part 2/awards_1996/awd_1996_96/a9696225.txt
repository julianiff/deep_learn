Abstract    :
              This project, in the area of analytical and surface chemistry,                 
              involves the comprehensive, systematic, and detailed investigation             
              of ion-surface reactions involving self-assembled monolayers,                  
              SAMs, of alkanethiolates on gold.  The primary goal of the                     
              research is to improve our understanding of the ion-surface                    
              chemistry observed when gas-phase polyatomic ions collide with a               
              well-characterized organic surface at collision energies in the                
              tens of electron volts regime.  The information obtained from                  
              these surface induced dissociation (SID) experiments will be used              
              to improve the characterization of both organic surfaces and                   
              projectile ions.                                                               
              %%%                                                                            
              Professor Wysocki and her students will investigate the chemistry              
              of low energy, polyatomic ions interacting with solid surfaces                 
              covered with self-assembled monolayers of organic molecules.  The              
              proposed research is of special technological significance because             
              of the potential application of self-assembled monolayers as                   
              photoresists for X-ray microlithography, i.e., reactive ion                    
              etching.
