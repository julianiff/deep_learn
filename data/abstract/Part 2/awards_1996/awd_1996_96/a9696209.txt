Abstract    :
                  9405569  Diane Waddle    The issue of modern human origins continues to be a
              source  of intense debate among paleoanthropologists.  Evolutionary  models
              that explain the origin of anatomically modern humans  include the single
              origin and regional continuity models.  While the merits of these two models
              are continually under  discussion, a test of the hypotheses contained within
              each  model was lacking.  Earlier work by this young investigator  refuted
              notions of a significant contribution by  Neanderthals to the modern human gene
              pool, and provided  information about the levels of gene flow that would be 
              required to adequately explain patterns of cranial variation  using a regional
              continuity model.    The current pilot project will validate the robusticity of
               video techniques in cranial analyses and enable a  sensitivity test of a
              series of earlier results.  Should the  findings of the pilot project allay
              concerns about the new  techniques being developed, a larger application of
              these  techniques to a more extensive series of fossil hominids  will be
              performed.    This innovative and very promising work is being performed  by a
              young professional of great promise.    ***
