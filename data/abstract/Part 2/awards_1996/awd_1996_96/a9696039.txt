Abstract    :
              9452694  Croft                The University of South Alabama will initiate a
              four week,  residential, Young Scholars Program in meteorology for 20 students 
              entering grades 10 and 11. The program is designed to help students  develop
              basic skills in the field of meteorology and to make them  aware of the
              interdisciplinary nature of meteorology and the career  opportunities
              available. The students will be involved in a  combination of lectures,
              laboratory exercises, field trips, and a  research project. The program will
              offer a rare opportunity to draw  upon and experience many different and varied
              scientific  principles.
