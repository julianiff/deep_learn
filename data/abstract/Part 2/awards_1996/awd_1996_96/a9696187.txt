Abstract    :
              9512741  Doering       This project concerns basic research in theoretical and 
              mathematical physics.  The topics of interest include  complex dynamic
              phenomena in many-degree-of-freedom  nonlinear deterministic systems and
              few-degree-of-freedom  nonlinear stochastic problems.  The primary focus of
              these  studies are the theoretical challenges presented by (1)  turbulence in
              fluid systems described by the incompressible  Navier-Stokes equations, and (2)
              nonequilibrium steady  states in mesoscopic physics and molecular biology.  The
               modes of investigation include modern applied mathematics  and numerical
              methods.  ***
