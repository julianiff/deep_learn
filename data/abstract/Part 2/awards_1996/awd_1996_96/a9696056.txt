Abstract    :
              9501964  Shaw       This program will investigate variations in lithospheric 
              strength along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  The study will combine an  analysis of
              multibeam bathymetric data to extract lengths and  vertical offsets of normal
              faults with a modeling portion to  arrive at a thermal picture of the
              lithosphere and thus an  estimate of strength, given an inferred composition
              and rheology.  ***
