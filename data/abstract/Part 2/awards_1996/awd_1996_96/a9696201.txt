Abstract    :
              9505887  Wicker       This work includes an investigation into the application
              of  adaptive error control schemes for CDMA systems.  As the number of  users
              increases, automatic retransmission requests will be used to  automatically
              increase the amount of controlled redundancy  accompanying all data
              transmissions.  The throughput and  reliability performance of the adaptive
              CDMA system will degrade  gracefully as the number of active users increases. 
              Acceptable  levels of throughput and reliability performance will thus be 
              provided well beyond the point at which a conventional CDMA system  would have
              collapsed. The research program will examine the  incorporation of adaptive
              algorithms into the convolutional and  Reed-Solomon error control systems
              currently used with CDMA  systems.  Research will also include more innovative
              schemes that  make use of channel estimation techniques based on side
              information  generated by error control decoders to create intelligent random  
              access networks.  ***
