Abstract    :
              9418960   Flurchick  Parallel computers require users and programmers to
              understand many different concepts and programming models to obtain performance
              from an application.  With increasing availability of parallel computers for
              researchers, it is important that researchers and students become better
              trained in the concepts of parallel processing.  The North Carolina
              Supercomputing Center and North Carolina State University with support from
              Cornell Theory Center, the National Center for Supercomputer Applications and
              the Center for Research Parallel Computing propose to develop and distribute
              with its partners, multimedia computer based instruction materials to students
              from industry and academia.  These materials will allow for self paced
              education covering all aspects of parallel processing.  One important aspect of
              the materials developed will be a strong interactive component to help the
              students evaluate their progress.
