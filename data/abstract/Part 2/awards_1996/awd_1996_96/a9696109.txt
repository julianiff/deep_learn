Abstract    :
              This grant provides partial support for an IEEE-sponsored database  comprised of
              sampled images and image sequences that has been  established at the National
              Center for Supercomputing Applications  (NCSA) in Urbana, Illinois, with the
              Signal Processing Society  serving as a gatekeeper.  This database is
              accessible via the  InterNet at no charge to the users.  Data is being
              solicited from  university, industrial and military sources.  The data will
              provide  a needed testbed for evaluation of image processing algorithms.
