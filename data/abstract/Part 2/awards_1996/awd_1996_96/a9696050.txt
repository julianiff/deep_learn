Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS-9510594  Abraham    The PI has proposed a collaborative effort
              with Detroit Diesel under the NSF Goali Program.  The proposed approach is to
              use existing multidimensional KIVA codes and simple models to further the
              understanding of Diesel engine flows, sprays, combustion and emissions.  The PI
              hopes to reproduce the observed performances of Detroit Diesel Engines, to
              characterize the flow field in the engine, to make preliminary suggestions
              about possible improvements to the engine to reduce emissions, to gain an
              appreciation for the capabilities and limitations of the model, and to foster
              further cooperation with the industrial host.  The PI intends to spend several
              weeks at Detroit Diesel Corporation becoming more familiar with the project and
              personnel.
