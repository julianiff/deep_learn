Abstract    :
              9502771  Taylor  Through  examining and evaluating how successful lifeline 
              seismic risk  reduction  programs  evolve,  this    project  takes  a   new 
              direction  in  seismic policy analysis.  Previous  investigations have given 
              more  attention  to  barriers  to  seismic    policy  implementation.  Case 
              studies of nine  successful  seismic  risk reduction  programs will be
              conducted.  Data  will  be  collected through    detailed   interviews   with 
              knowledgeable   parties  representing   pertinent  internal  and  external 
              organizations.  These  examinations  will clarify internal and  external 
              factors related to program success.  A project advisory  panel will review
              interim  procedures  and  results.  Project  findings  will   be  published  in
               a  monograph aimed at two  audiences:  (1)  policy  makers   who  need  to 
              understand  seismic  risk  and  decision techniques used in these programs, and
              (2)  engineers who wish  to understand the policy making process.  ***
