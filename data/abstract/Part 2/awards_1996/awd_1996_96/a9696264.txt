Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9528708     The PI has proposed the use of acoustic coaxing
              methods to promote acoustic cavitation be produced and used of chemicals as in
              present deinking processes.  Bubbles in the application of chemical free
              deinking.  By combining a strong sound field of low frequency (1 MHZ) with a
              weal should field of high frequency (30 MHZ), microcavitation can generated in
              the process would also aid in the floatation of particles away from the paper.
