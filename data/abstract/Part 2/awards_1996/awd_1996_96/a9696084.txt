Abstract    :
              9410707  Shene  Using a geometric approach, this project aims to completely
              solve  the problem of using Dupin cyclides as blending surfaces for  all pairs
              of CSG primitives, and to explore the possibility  that other tractable
              surfaces, such as the cyclide family, can be  used for blending purpose.   
              Initially, the project will investigate the role of Dupin  cyclides as blending
              surfaces for CSG primitives.  This includes  construction algorithms and
              characterization results for each  pair of CSG primitives and their
              generalizations.  Since  constructions are based on the geometric
              characteristics, not on  implicit/parametric equations, the construction
              algorithms would  be more robust.  Next, various generalizations of Dupin
              cyclides  (e.g., projective cyclides, general cyclides and quartics with a 
              double conics) will be examined to see if there are viable and  tractable
              classes of lower degree algebraic surfaces for blending  purpose.  Techniques
              from descriptive, algebraic and differential  geometry will be used to study
              the geometry of these surface  classes and to develop efficient construction
              algorithms.  Finally, some fundamental issues of general blending surface 
              construction will be considered by looking at the connection  between the
              geometry of the intersection curve, the clipping  curves, and the blending
              surfaces.  ***
