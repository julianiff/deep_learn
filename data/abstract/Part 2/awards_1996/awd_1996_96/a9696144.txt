Abstract    :
              Siu         Artificial neural networks present a new model for massively 
              parallel computation and a promising paradigm for solving large  scale
              optimization problems.  This research is exploring the  advantages of neural
              network-based models over conventional  models for computation, and a novel
              design of neuromorphic  computing architectures for applications in signal and
              image  processing.  A theoretical framework is being established to  derive
              tight tradeoffs between the number of elements and the  number of layers in
              neural networks.         The results should answer some of the key open
              questions in  the analysis of neural networks using classical mathematical 
              tools such as rational approximation techniques and harmonic  analysis.
