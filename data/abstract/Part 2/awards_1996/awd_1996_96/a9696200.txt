Abstract    :
                   This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is                  
              made to Dr. Lai-Sang Young.  Dr. Young will continue her work in               
              the area of Chaotic Dynamics.  In particular she will investigate              
              the following three topics:  asymptotic distributions and                      
              stochastic stability for attractors, dynamics of the Henon map,                
              and statistical properties of chaotic systems.                                 
                   The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high quality               
              of the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as                 
              potential for continued significant contributions to scientific                
              research, the academic profession, and the education of future                 
              scientists.  Dr. Young will continue her work in the area of                   
              Chaotic Dynamics.  Particularly noteworthy is her interactions                 
              with students.
