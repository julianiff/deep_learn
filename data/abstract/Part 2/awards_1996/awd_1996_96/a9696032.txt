Abstract    :
              9321547  Key  This three-year program will quantify the individual energy 
              streams that make up the arctic surface radiation budget, and will  relate the
              observed radiation distribution to synoptic-scale wind,  pressure, and moisture
              patterns.  It will be the first effort to  produce a comprehensive radiation
              climatology for the Arctic.    The arctic surface energy budget, particularly
              that of the Arctic  Ocean, has been identified as a major component of the
              global  climate system that is potentially sensitive to climate-scale 
              perturbations due to feedback mechanisms involving the surface  albedo, the
              stability of the lower troposphere, and water vapor  transport.    The project
              includes four main tasks: (1) The analysis of solar and  long-wave radiation
              data obtained directly at manned observing  sites in the arctic.  (2) The
              calculation of radiative fluxes at the  surface and at the top of the
              atmosphere using a satellite-based  cloud data product from the International
              Satellite Cloud  Climatology Project (ISCCP).  (3) For selected months, the 
              ISCCP-derived fluxes will be compared to the corresponding  synoptic regime,
              and (4) a study to assess the effects of the  sampling and analysis procedure
              on the radiation statistics and their  temporal variability will be undertaken.
