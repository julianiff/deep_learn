Abstract    :
              9553130  Johnson  The research is primarily in the areas of reliability and 
              environmental hydraulic engineering, involving problems of stream  channel
              erosion around bridge foundations, including erosion due  to local scour,
              channel restorations and modifications, and  lateral migration of streams, and
              the reliability of the bridges  as these erosional processes occur around the
              foundations.  Additional studies will develop a better understanding of the 
              erosional process, as well as develop criteria for the design and  preventive
              maintenance of pier foundations.  Studies will examine  the effect of the
              duration of the peak storm discharge on the  scour depth.  ***
