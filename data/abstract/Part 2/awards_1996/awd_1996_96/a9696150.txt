Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award will                 
              support the development of submillimeter instrumentation.  The                 
              principal investigator, Dr. John Carlstrom, plans to develop                   
              improved submillimeter receivers and build the first submillimeter             
              astronomical interferometer.  These instruments will be used to                
              study the complex processes that guide star formation in our own               
              Galaxy and in external galaxies.
