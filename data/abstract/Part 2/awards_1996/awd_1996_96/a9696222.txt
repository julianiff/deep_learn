Abstract    :
              9316371  Koch    PI will examine potential causes for large-mammal extinctions
              in  the late Pleistocene, specifically testing the hypothesis that  large
              herbivores, such as mastodonts, had specialized dietary  requirements that
              could not be met due to rapid floral community  reorganization spurred by
              warming and increased seasonality.   Carbon isotope composition of tooth enamel
              will provide an axis for  distinguishing dietary specialization from dietary
              flexibility.  A  pilot study of Sr isotopes will provide a monitor of seasonal 
              migration patterns.  Oxygen isotopes will be measured as  temperature proxies.
