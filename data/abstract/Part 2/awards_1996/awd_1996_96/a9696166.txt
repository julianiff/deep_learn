Abstract    :
              Recently, there has been a                                                     
              revolution in the field of ultrafast                                           
              lasers.  New broadband solid-state                                             
              laser materials such as titanium-                                              
              doped sapphire make it possible to                                             
              produce pulses of unprecedented                                                
              short duration and high average                                                
              power, using very simple lasers.                                               
              Also, the recently-developed                                                   
              technique of chirped-pulse                                                     
              amplification makes it possible to                                             
              generate peak powers of greater than                                           
              a terawatt using a small-scale laser                                           
              system.  These high-power pulses, in                                           
              combination with various nonlinear-                                            
              optical techniques, make it possible                                           
              for the first time to generate                                                 
              ultrashort pulses at ultraviolet and                                           
              vacuum-ultraviolet wavelengths.  My                                            
              plan is to study these techniques of                                           
              generating short-wavelength light,                                             
              and then to use short-wavelength                                               
              pulses of 1-100 fs duration to study                                           
              dynamic processes in material and
