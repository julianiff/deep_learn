Abstract    :
              9315825  Clarke     This research will study the upper mantle, including
              subducting  slabs, and the core-mantle boundary by means of a dense linear 
              array of 20 broad-band PASSCAL seismometers installed from Missouri  to
              Massachusetts, a distance of 1736 km.  Data from earthquakes  recorded by the
              array will substantially increase resolution of  structures such as the
              core-mantle boundary under the Pacific, slab  penetration depths in the
              Aleutians, Kuril-Kamchatka, Peru-Chile,  and Central America, and the details
              of the upper mantle under  North America and the Caribbean.  This work should
              shed significant  new insight into details of the earth's convection engine and
               resultant driving forces of plates and earthquakes.  ***
