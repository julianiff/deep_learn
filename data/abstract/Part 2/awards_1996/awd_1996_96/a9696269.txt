Abstract    :
                This research explores the scaling-down of direct-drive actuator  technology
              previously developed by the PI.  The prior efforts  involved theoretical
              electrodynamics models of generalized EM  actuators based on screw theory, and
              led to the development of  miniature, high-torque spherical camera-pointing
              motors.  The goal  of the current project is to adapt the theory and magnetic 
              technology to several robotic actuator applications at millimeter  and
              submillimeter scales,  This involves a combination of  simulations and
              theoretical investigations of scaling properties  and dynamics, development of
              a series of experimental devices to  serve as testbeds for the ideas, and
              exploration of several medical  and telerobotic applications of such
              miniaturization through  research collaborations and corporate partnerships. 
              The research  results will be disseminated  through multimedia, including 
              publication in mathematical hypertext and access to experimental  robots
              through the World-Wide Web.  The plan is to publish the  designs and details of
              experimental prototypes so that researchers  are be able to access our files
              and produce exact copies of the  devices.
