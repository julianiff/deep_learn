              surfaces on receptor association                                               
              rates and binding affinities to                                                
              immobilized ligands are to be                                                  
              elucidated.  Kinetic models of

              receptors to functionalized surfaces                                           
              will be studied by: (1) evanescent

              affinities will be determined by                                               
              evanescent fiber optic spectroscopy.                                           
              The uniformity of specific receptor                                            
              binding will be assessed by                                                    
              fluorescence microscopy.  Binding
