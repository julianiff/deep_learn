Abstract    :
                The objective of this effort is to explore the concept of dominant  edges and
              dominant tasks for scheduling parallel programs on a  distributed  memory
              processing system.  A dominant edge will play  a crucial role in  generating a
              task schedule because of the  associated communication cost.  A  dominant task
              is a coarse  grained task with low run time overhead such that  they can be 
              rescheduled on a different processor to achieve a load balance.  Thus all
              remaining (non-dominant) tasks will be allocated  statically to  processors.   
              This project will build on the earlier work on Threshold  Scheduling, where the
              degree of parallelism is treaded off for  the schedule  length.  In this
              project, the goal is to investigate  the threshold scheduling to  enhance
              unified data and code  partitioning for a family of distributed memory 
              architectures  including Touchstone Delta and Paragon.  This will involve the 
              formalization of feasibility conditions and optimality  conditions.  A 
              feasibility condition guarantees that the schedule  delay of a task from its 
              earliest start time is below the  threshold and an optimality condition used a 
              merit function to  decide the best task-processor match for a set of tasks 
              competing  for a given processor.
