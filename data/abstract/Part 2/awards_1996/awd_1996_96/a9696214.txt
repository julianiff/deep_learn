Abstract    :
              9401234  Yang       This award supports mathematical research investigating 
              spaces of analytic functions and the operator obtained through  multiplication
              by the identity function.  The goals are to study  the existence of
              nontangential limits for each function in the  closure of the analytic
              polynomials in some power norm relativeto  a measure and the properties of the
              shift operator on these  spaces.  In addition work will be done investigating
              the  structure of invariant subspaces and self-duality.  Further work  focuses
              on the set of bounded point evaluations for the closure  of rational functions
              with poles off a given compact set,  approximation problems for "near" analytic
              function spaces and  the spectral properties of the shift acting on the closure
              of  theideal generated by the conjugate of the identity.       The study of
              function spaces obtained as the closure of  aclass of polynomials has a long
              history going back  before Mergalyan.  Its value derives from a combination of 
              approximation results stated in more or less geometric terms.   The domain of
              these investigations is confined to the use of  analytic functions, requiring
              considerable expertise in the field  of classical function theory and the
              modern field of Banach  spaces.  ***
