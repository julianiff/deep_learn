Abstract    :
              9452399  Carrick                              This project is designed to
              enhance the undergraduate instruction  in biology by integrating microbial
              ecology into the subject matter  of three courses. Inclusion of microorganisms
              in the study of  biology is important since they contribute significantly to
              the  formation and decomposition of organic matter, in particular 
              biological-mediated oxidation and reduction of carbon. Emphasis is  therefore
              in microbial ecology and involves 1) identification and  quantification, 2)
              trophic structure, 3) growth and metabolism  (light, temperature, nutrients).
              Unifying ecological principles are  also being demonstrated and compared with
              more complex biological  systems that are often difficult to study in the time
              allotted for  most class laboratories (3-4 hours). In addition, field 
              investigations cultivate student appreciation for some  environmental realities
              that need to be taken into account when  designing and interpreting experiments
              in ecology.
