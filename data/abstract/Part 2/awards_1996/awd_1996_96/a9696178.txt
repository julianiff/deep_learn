Abstract    :
              9410127  Dewhurst       The award is for research involving the addition of 
              polycrystal slip modeling capabilities to a three-dimensional  finite element
              code to predict the effects of surface roughening  during bulk material
              deformation.  The work extends current work on  the prediction of
              microstructural texture and anisotropic material  properties during bulk
              deformation and relates surface roughening  to individual grains on the free
              surface.  Individual grains are  modeled by individual elements of the mesh.  A
              combined  experimental and numerical simulation approach is taken to validate 
              the techniques developed, and the sensitivity of the surface  roughness to
              process parameters is investigated.       Metalforming industries such as the
              automotive industry and  the beverage can industry rely on sheet forming
              processes where  surface roughening is a problem.  Improved understanding of
              the  phenomenon of surface roughening is likely to result from the work 
              described here and would benefit these industries.
