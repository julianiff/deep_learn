Abstract    :
              9402435  Agrawal  This research project develops a comprehensive theory for 
              assembly in space using free-floating robots. Freely moving  systems in space
              conserve linear and angular momentum. As  moving systems collide with each
              other, the velocities get  altered due to transfer of momentum. During this
              project,  strategies are developed for assembly using analytical  models of
              self motion, propulsion, docking, pock-up, and  release, and these strategies
              are validated in a free-  floating planar robot laboratory facility.
              Simulations  include commanding dual-arm robots to propel to  destinations,
              dock with a material table, pick up work  pieces, combine into prespecified
              assemblies, and release on  an assembly platform. Analytical developments, in
              addition  to kinematics and rigid body dynamics, include impact and  collision
              dynamics of multibody systems. These robots also  have applications on industry
              work floors for component  handling and assembly tasks.  ***
