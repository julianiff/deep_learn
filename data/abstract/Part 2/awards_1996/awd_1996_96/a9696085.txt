Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is to theoretically investigate the
              interaction of oxygen with diamond surfaces in order to (1) identify the
              principal elementary chemical reactions of O atoms, OH radicals and O2
              molecules with diamond surface sites and establish their kinetic and
              thermodynamic parameters, and (2) use the results to minimize the oxygen
              poisoning effect in CVD diamond.      The PI will make use of his recently
              developed technique of simulating gas-surface interactions and surface
              processes using molecular dynamics (MD) modeling of the atoms, molecules and
              extended structures involved.  The method uses a semi-empirical
              quantum-mechanical potential (SEQMP) to describe the region of the surface
              where reactions occur and an empirical potential (EP) to describe the rest of
              the surface.
