Abstract    :
              9310068  Abreu    The activities of trade and exchange are fundamental to
              economics,  yet, until very recently, there was little research on perhaps the 
              most pure form of trading, i.e., bilateral bargaining.  A research 
              breakthrough, about a decade ago, led to a flood of papers on this  topic, all
              of which emphasized in myriad variations, the role of  the relative slight
              impatience of bargainers to come to agreement,  and the precise protocol of the
              bargaining process.  This theory  has been widely and usefully applied in a
              variety of fields,  including industrial organization, international trade and
              finance,  political economy, macroeconomics, and so on.    This project
              readdresses this basic question from a new perspective  and replaces the slight
              impatience between offers of the old theory  with slight uncertainty about the
              strategic posture of one's  opponent.  That is, with small probability the
              other player may be  one of many "irrational" types.  The message very crudely
              put is  this: Bargaining isn't so much about slight impatience and the  exact
              protocol of offers and counteroffers; rather, it is driven by  such factors as
              bluffing and posturing of various sorts.  In this  spirit, the model developed
              stresses reputational effects which  both causal empiricism and personal
              introspection suggest are  important in bargaining.    So far this approach
              seems very promising, and some simple cases  have been completely analyzed. 
              This project will extend these  preliminary results to more general settings. 
              As noted, the  earlier bargaining models have been fruitfully applied in many 
              areas; a reputation-based bargaining paradigm will be potentially  as useful.
