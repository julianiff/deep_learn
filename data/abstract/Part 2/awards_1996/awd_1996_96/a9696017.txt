Abstract    :
              9410078  Deshmukh   This research addresses the problem of decision making
              difficulty or complexity in a manufacturing system characterized by the
              integration of several subsystems.  The underlying premise to the proposed
              study is that integration of multiple functions and elements in manufacturing
              increases a system's complexity or the difficulty of making decisions regarding
              the system.  Specifically, the research will define complexity, establish
              metrics for measuring complexity, study the relationship between design and
              control parameters and complexity, and suggest methods for controlling
              complexity.   The outcome of the research will improve the understanding of the
              effects of integration on decision making difficulty in manufacturing systems. 
              Furthermore, the quality of decisions made as the complexity of a system
              changes can be analyzed and perhaps, have confidence levels attached to them. 
              Improved understanding of the effect of integration on manufacturing complexity
              can lead to better modeling and analysis of manufacturing systems.
