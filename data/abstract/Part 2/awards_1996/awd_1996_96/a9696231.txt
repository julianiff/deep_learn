Abstract    :
               This project supports the research of a multidisciplinary team of cultural
              anthropologists, geographers, physical anthropologists and sociologists to
              study the effects of changes in property rights on local economic activities,
              the environment, and the impact of all this on the health and growth of local
              populations in a poor, traditional Mayan Indian area of Yucatan, Mexico.  Using
              multiple methods including the analysis of remote sensing images of the local
              land use patterns, the creation of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
              databases and maps, ethnographic studies of land use, and biological studies of
              children's' growth and nutrition, the project will follow ten small
              communities: five communities which privatized their communal land holdings and
              five communities which retain the communal property rights regime of the past
              60 years.   The hypothesis to be tested is that privatization of land rights
              will lead to increased concentration of property ownership and increased
              poverty for the community at large.   This research is important because the
              global pattern of change is towards private property rights and increased
              production for regional and exterior markets.  In depth comparative and
              longitudinal studies such as this are necessary if planners are to create
              policies to ameliorate negative impacts and avoid increasing poverty and
              inequalities.
