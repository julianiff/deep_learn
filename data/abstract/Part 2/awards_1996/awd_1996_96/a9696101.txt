Abstract    :
              Modeling and empirical measurements suggest that much of the                   
              ocean's margin is net heterotrophic that is utilizing more                     
              organic matter then is produced by photosynthesis.  Seasonally,                
              however, many continental shelves are dominated by autotrophic                 
              processes and may then export organic matter to the ocean's                    
              interior.  This annual cycle of trophic status is largely the                  
              result of an interactive two factor response by bacteria to low                
              temperature and low substrate concentration.  Bacterial isolates               
              from the Arctic Ocean, the Labrador Current, and the subtropical               
              southeastern continental shelf all indicate greatly reduced rates              
              of growth when cultured at their annual minimum temperature and                
              at low substrate concentrations, comparable to those normally                  
              present in seawater.  Little is known, however, about net                      
              metabolism in arctic marine communities.  Bacterial production is              
              very low during the early spring period when most primary                      
              production is within the sea ice, and it is higher in late summer              
              after the open-water phytoplankton bloom, all based on limited                 
              data, also very limited geographically.  This project will result              
              in an extensive concurrent data set on phytoplankton biomass,                  
              bacterial and microzooplankton abundance, nutrient uptake                      
              (nitrate and ammonium), inorganic nutrients, hydrographic                      
              variables, primary production, microbial secondary production,                 
              and microbial respiration in the Arctic Ocean.  Knowledge of the               
              autotrophy-heterotrophy status of the arctic will be an important              
              consideration for modeling the global carbon cycle and for                     
              predicting the effects of global climate change, as well as for                
              understanding and modeling polar food webs.
