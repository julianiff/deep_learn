Abstract    :
              9453901  Vining-Brown  The purpose of the project is to conduct a study of the 
              intersection of race and gender on the differential career path,  experiences,
              and access to opportunity of minority women in the  scientific work force.  The
              project has three goals. The first goal  is to bring the concerns of minority
              women into the mainstream of  research on women in science and to leverage
              their concerns as  significant in their own right--not merely as an adjunct to
              women's  or minority issues.  The second goal i to sharpen and extend the 
              conceptual debate on equity in science by developing a framework  that accounts
              for race and gender in process and outcomes in the  science labor force.  The
              third goal is to identify and develop  more accurate indicators of access to
              opportunity and power that  describe the nature and form of specific processes
              that  differentiate minority women in their career attainments in  science.
