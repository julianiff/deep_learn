Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research underway includes studies of a variety of surface                     
              processes with modern surface science techniques.  Surface                     
              chemistry on technologically important aluminide surfaces (i.e.                
              TiAl, FeAl, CoAl, and NiAl) will be investigated.  Also, reactions             
              of hyperthermal (1-10 eV) ions on solid surfaces, including the                
              aluminides, will be researched.  Finally, research is planned that             
              uses tunable synchrotron light to synthesize epitaxial dielectric              
              thin films (e.g. BN and AlN) on a variety of ordered substrates,               
              from condensed layers of molecular precursors at cryogenic                     
              temperatures.
