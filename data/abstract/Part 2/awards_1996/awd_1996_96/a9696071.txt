Abstract    :
              9510458  Wang   This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry award
              will support two Graduate Student Industrial Fellowships and a fraction of a
              faculty member's time to work on a collaborative project between the University
              of Maryland-Baltimore County and Alcoa Technical Center.  The objective of the
              research that these GOALI Fellows will participate in is a methodology to
              characterize geometric variations of aluminum automotive space frames, and to
              transfer these discoveries into industrial practice for the development and
              production of all-aluminum automobiles.  The research tasks are to determine
              the appropriate manufactured part models for aluminum space frame extrusions,
              and to identify the appropriate tolerance methods for space frames.  Alcoa has
              identified researchers to work with the U of MD-Baltimore County team, and has
              committed experimental and software support for this project.   Results from
              this collaboration will allow better fits in the aluminum space frame design
              for automobiles, reducing weight and increasing fuel economy.  These results
              will make manufacture of these frames possible in quantities needed by the
              automobile industry.  ***
