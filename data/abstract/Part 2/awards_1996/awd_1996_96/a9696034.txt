Abstract    :
                9415689  Rothschild         This project will provide U.S. contribution to the
               Secretariat of  the International Global Ocean Ecosystems  Program (GLOBEC)
              which is an international climate change  research program focused on
              understanding the impact of  global change on ocean ecosystems.   This office
              will  provide daily management of the GLOBEC program including  program
              coordination, meeting coordination and development,  and communication of
              GLOBEC. INTernational  activities.       During the period of this proposal
              GLOBEC.  INTernational will be undertaking a series of crucial  steps  toward
              fulfilling its mission:     To understand the effects  of physical processes on
              predator-prey interactions and  population dynamics of zooplankton, and their
              relation to  ocean ecosystems and application to fisheries in the context  of 
              the global climate system and anthropogenic change.  GLOBEC.  INT will be
              preparing its Science Plan and  presenting it to the larger scientific
              community in July  1994 for approval.  With the completed and adopted Science 
              Plan, GLOBEC will petition IGBP for inclusion in Fall 1994.  GLOBEC will then
              be preparing its Implementation Plan for  full-scale program implementation. 
              The GLOBEC.  INTernational Secretariat will be responsible for the  successful
              execution of each of these steps.
