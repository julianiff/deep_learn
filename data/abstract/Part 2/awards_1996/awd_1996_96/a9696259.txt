Abstract    :
              The PI proposes a two-phase research program on high resolution  computerized
              ionospheric tomography (CIT) algorithm development.   Phase I will characterize
              (theoretically and experimentally) the  resolving capabilities and
              sensitivities of all major CIT  algorithms with respect to specific
              reconstruction goals.  Phase II  will develop high resolution CIT algorithms
              through (1) linkage of  traditional ground-based TEC with ionospheric data of
              opportunity  to provide CIT algorithms with maximum information of the true 
              ionospheric distribution, and (2) incorporation of mathematical  equations
              describing ionospheric processes into CIT algorithms.***
