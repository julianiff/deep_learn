Abstract    :
               This project is concerned with the development of   implementing new matrix
              decomposition algorithms for solving   the  systems of  linear algebraic
              equations arising when orthogonal  spline   collocation (that is,  spline
              collocation at Gauss points)  is applied to separable,   second order,  linear
              problems on  rectangular regions.  These algorithms   have application  in  the
              solution of nonseparable boundary value problems,   problems on  general 
              regions, and time dependent problems.    The success of   matrix decomposition 
              algorithms depends on  knowledge of the eigenvalues and   eigenvectors of
              matrices  arising  in corresponding two-point boundary value problems   in one
              space  dimension.  Knowledge of such an eigensystem with respect to   one 
              coordinate  variable reduces the original two-dimensional discrete    problem
              to solving a  collection of independent discrete two-point  boundary value  
              problems with  respect to the other coordinate  variable.  A software   package
              is developed  implementing  orthogonal spline collocation algorithms with  
              polynomials of arbitrary order on nonuniform partitions in   each  coordinate 
              direction.   The package includes, as a special  case, a fast   transform
              solver for piecewise Hermite  bicubic orthogonal   spline collocation  for
              Poisson's equation in  various coordinate systems.
