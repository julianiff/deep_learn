Abstract    :
              Pillage         The research is on developing simulation capabilities at the 
              system level, which are as powerful as those at the chip level.   To this end,
              tools which are applicable at the integrated  circuit, packaging, module, and
              board levels without loss of  generality are being developed.  Specific areas
              being  investigated are: fast extraction techniques which trade off some 
              accuracy for efficiency; and simulation models and techniques to  enable
              topdown design.  Timing analysis of boards or multi-chip  modules requires
              development of tools for the extraction,  characterization and simulation of
              transmission lines at the  system simulation level.  Toward this end
              interconnect macro-  models, similar to those for on-chip RC interconnect
              circuits,  which are compatible with system-level design automation tools,  are
              being explored.
