              Older reinforced concrete frame structure constructed in seismic areas of the
              United States are usually non-ductile and are thus identified as hazardous. 
              Laboratory studies have showed that the use of "ordinary" Fiber Reinforced
              Concrete (FRC) in a new construction has substantially improved seismic
              response, but conventional seismic retrofit techniques have not yet taken
              advantage of FRCs or High Performance FRCs (HPFRCs).  The advantage of FRCs is
              a significant increase in ductility over that of conventional reinforced
              concrete.  The advantage of HPFRC is that, when loaded beyond the elastic
              limit, these materials exhibit a significant improvement in the ability to
              undergo further increase in stress and strain before failure.  This increase in
              tensile strength and ductility leads to an enormous increase in ability of the
              structural frame to dissipate energy-a feature particularly desirable for
              earthquake-resistance design.    The goals of this research project herein is
              to develop an innovative technique for seismic retrofit of nonductile
              reinforced concrete frames using recently developed HPFRCs which exhibit
              significant increase in the composite strain and stress capacity in the
              inelastic range.  Use of this material can solve the following common problems
              of reinforced concrete frames:  (1) Inadequate anchorage of the discontinuous
              bottom reinforcement in beams, (2) inadequate confinement of the column lap
              splices, and (3) inadequate confinement of the joint.    The research is
              expected to open up a new area for seismic repair and rehabilitation of
              non-ductile structures by using newly developed HPFRC  composites.    The
              project is supported under NSF Initiative "Repair and Rehabilitation Research
              for Seismic Resistance of Structures."  #  c8   LU8869  DOC            Z   b8
