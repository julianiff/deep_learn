Abstract    :
              9504884  Silvotti     The proposed research lies in the interface of algebraic
              geometry and quantum field theory. The investigator proposes to give a complete
              and direct topological description of the models of conformal field theory
              corresponding to generalized theta functions in terms of cohomology spaces. The
              cohomology to be used is the cohomology of multivalued holomorphic differential
              forms on the affine complement of hypersurfaces in complex algebraic varieties.
                 The proposed research brings together very classical problems in function
              theory with the latest development in mathematical physics (quantum field
              theory). The underlying physical theory was originally introduced to describe
              the critical behavior of a class of statistical systems on planar lattices.
