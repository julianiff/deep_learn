Abstract    :
              This research project will apply new methods emerging from                     
              molecular biology to the area of plant systematic biology.  The                
              investigator will develop single copy nuclear gene sequences for               
              comparative study using the family Solanaceae as a model system.               
              Further applications of the methods will be made to higher level               
              phylogenies in the angiosperms.

              Research of this type is fundamental to understanding the basic                
              lineage relationships among higher plants, many of which may be                
              of agronomic importance.  Futhermore, methods developed under                  
              this project will likely be valuable to a broad suite of other                 
              investigators.
