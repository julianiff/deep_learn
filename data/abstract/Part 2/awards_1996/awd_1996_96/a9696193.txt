Abstract    :
              9400882  Lieman       This award funds the research of Professor Daniel Lieman
              on  properties of zeta functions of specific elliptic curves.  This  work is in
              keeping with a major theme in modern number theory,   that discrete geometric
              information can be studied analytically.   This approach seems to be very
              effective for problems in number  theory, particularly diophantine problems.   
                   This work falls in the general area of Number Theory.   Number Theory is
              the study of properties of the whole numbers and  is the oldest branch of
              systematic mathematics. Number theorists  often study diophantine problems
              where equations are required to  have exact numerical solutions. In modern
              days, these diophantine  problems have furnished the driving force to creation
              of new  theories in many other parts of mathematics. Recently Number  Theory
              and diophantine methods have found astonishing  applications in theoretical
              computer science and communication.
