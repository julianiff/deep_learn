Abstract    :
              9350405  Murnane       Professor Murnane will use this Presidential Faculty
              Fellow  award to study the action of ultrashort X-ray pulses on plasmas  and
              condensed materials.  The X-ray pulses will be produced with  techniques she
              has developed in her laboratory in which  femtosecond (10-15 sec) optical
              pulses are converted to the x-ray  regime through plasma excitation.  ***
