                          INT 9315271 Zeger   The primary objective of this U.S.  Hungary
              research project between Dr. Kenneth Zeger of the University of Illinois and
              Dr. Gabor Lugosi of the Technical University of Budapest is to examine source
              coding problems and classification problems where it is desirable to conduct
              coding and classification together, for the same source.  The researchers will
              study neural classification and consistency issues, universal vector
              quantization and empirical computer design.  Efforts should lead to a better
              understanding of empirically designed lossy source coders, universal lossy
              source coders and statistical pattern classification.  Results are expected to
              yield rate of convergence information for these techniques and may be applied
              to areas such as computer imaging in nuclear medicine.  This research in
              computer communications fulfills the program objectives of advancing science
              and engineering by enabling leading experts in the U. S. and Eastern Europe to
              combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong
              mutual interest and competence.
