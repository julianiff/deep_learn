              research support to Dr. Robert Landick.  His general research                  
              goals are to study the interactions between RNA, DNA, and                      
              proteins during messenger RNA elongation.  He will be studying                 
              this process in both bacteria and mammalian cells, and will be                 
              collaborating with experts in electron microscopy, nuclear                     
              magnetic resonance, and X-ray crystallography.
