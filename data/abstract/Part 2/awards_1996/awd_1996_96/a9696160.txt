Abstract    :
                        9414740  Kumosa  This research will investigate mixed mode fracture
              and failure  mechanisms in polymer matrix composites and adhesively bonded 
              polymer composite systems subjected to biaxial loading conditions.   This
              research will significantly contribute to the understanding of  high
              temperature mixed mode micro- and macro-fracture mechanisms in  unidirectional
              polymer matrix composites caused by biaxial loading  and provide new insights
              into the mixed mode failure of adhesively  bonded polymer composite systems
              tested under static and cyclic  loading conditions under biaxial loading.  A
              possible practical  significance of the proposed work is that the biaxial test
              method  being proposed can become a standard test for mixed mode fracture 
              analysis of many advanced composite systems over a wide temperature  range.
