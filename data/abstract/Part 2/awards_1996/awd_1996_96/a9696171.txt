Abstract    :
              9453475  Agrawal  This is a Presidential Faculty Fellow (PFF) Award. Under this 
              award, research related to modeling, simulation, optimization and  control of
              multi-degree-of-freedom electro-mechanical systems is  pursued in order to
              develop a fundamental understanding of the  dynamic behavior of such systems.
              The major emphasis of this  research is on free-floating robotic assembly, and
              the  development of multi-segment small motion robotic vehicles which  are
              useful for applications such as inspection, exploration,  manipulation, and
              locomotion in restricted and hazardous narrow  spaces typically inaccessible to
              human beings. In addition,  innovative techniques are developed for global
              optimization of  multi-degree-of-freedom nonlinear electro-mechanical dynamic 
              systems.  ***
