Abstract    :
                This research will analyze broad frequency/wavelength seismic                
              array data to investigate the nature of the scattered wavefield and            
              coda produced by sources at local, regional, and teleseismic                   
              distances.  Analysis of apparent velocity, direction, and                      
              polarization will allow estimation of scattering sources and                   
              mechanisms producing coda for sources at various distances.  P, S              
              and surface wave coda  will be searched to see how scattered energy            
              differs for sources at different distances, at different times for             
              a given source, and with scattering type.  Three-dimensional                   
              numerical modeling will be used to produce scattered wavefields                
              with characteristics observed in the array data.  Results should               
              show how production of seismic coda, a proposed earthquake                     
              prediction parameter, is related to earth structure and how these              
              structures affect wave propagation over a very broad                           
              frequency/wavelength range.
