Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will explore the implications of the "naive theory" view         
              for the teaching of thermal physics.                                           
                                                                                             
              The main questions to be addressed concern how to promote theory change.       
              The investigator will focus on three factors:  (1) making the textbook         
              theory intelligible in spite of students' misconceptions; (2) providing        
              students with metaconceptual understanding of the nature of scientific         
              knowledge; and (3) designing the curriculum taking into account the            
              process of differentiation itself.  Given that the differentiation             
              appears to proceed in specific stages the curricular sequence should be        
              chosen to optimize the transition from one stage to the next.                  
                                                                                             
              Two classroom studies (Studies 1 and 4) explore the use of multiple            
              computer-implemented, interactive, visual models in making the textbook        
              theory accessible to ninth graders by comparing a model-based curriculum       
              to a more standard one based on the laws from experimental and                 
              problem-solving applying the newly learned laws.  Study 4 also examines        
              the effect of metaconceptual knowledge on the reconceptualization at the       
              content level.  Two studies (Studies 2 and 3) explore the process of           
              differentiation induced by a computer model in individual students over        
              a one-month period.  The project will develop prototype teaching               
              materials (software, curriculum and a teacher guide) based on these            
              models.
