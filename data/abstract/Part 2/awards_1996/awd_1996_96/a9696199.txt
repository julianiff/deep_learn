Abstract    :
              9521045  Moore  A numerical study of the singular vectors of the Gulf Stream 
              meander and ring region will be conducted for  two different  time periods
              during which regular analysis of the region are  available.  This  work will be
              done in the context  of  both  quasi-geostrophic and primitive equation models
              with the aim  of  understanding the dynamical and physical  factors  which  are
               believed to limit the predictability of a  highly  non-  linear oceanic region
              such as the Gulf Stream.
