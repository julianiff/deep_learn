                                        ABSTRACT                                    Proposal:
              #96-23546    PI: Crews & Rhen    Title:  Evolutionary origin of behavioral
              organization           Organization of reproductive and aggressive behaviors 
              by estradiol (via aromatization of testosterone in mammals)  during early
              development is well documented in birds and  mammals.  There is a correlation
              between the organized and  heterogametic sex in these groups; males are
              organized (lose  the ability to display female-typical behavior) in mammals, 
              whereas females are organized (lose the ability to display  male-typical
              behavior) in birds.  The opposite sex retains  the capacity to display both
              female- and male-typical  behavior.  A similar correlation is observed in other
               vertebrates with genotypic sex determination.  Alternate  explanations are (1)
              that a developmental constraint results  in organization of the heterogametic
              sex, or (2) that there  is a functional relationship between organization and 
              gonochorism.  Reptiles with environmental sex determination  do not fit into
              the constraint paradigm because they lack a  heterogametic sex.  In contrast,
              these species may be  organized if organization is adaptive.  In this study, 
              manipulation of embryonic temperature (and thereby gonadal  sex) and adult
              hormones will be performed to distinguish  among hypotheses about organization.
               Log-linear,  multivariate, and path analyses will be used to analyze 
              reproductive and  aggressive behaviors.  Results will (1)  illuminate the
              proximate cause of behavioral variation in an  ESD species, and (2) for the
              first time delineate and test  alternate hypotheses about the evolutionary
              causes of  behavioral organization in the context of sex determining 
              mechanisms.
