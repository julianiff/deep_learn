Abstract    :
              9623643  HALL  Reconstruction of the historical (OphylogeneticO) relationships
              among plant groups, through comparative analysis of nuclear and organellar
              ribosomal DNA sequences, is an integral part of systematic biology. 
              Researchers increasingly recognize the need to obtain data from several
              different DNA sequences, representing independent genetic loci, because a
              phylogeny inferred from any single gene may not accurately recover the
              relationships among the organisms under investigation.  However, the number of
              genes known to be both useful for these investigations and accessible to
              researchers (quickly and inexpensively obtainable from a wide range of
              organisms) is still very small.    In an effort to expand the pool of nuclear
              genes available for molecular systematic analyses at lower taxonomic levels,
              Amy Denton, under the supervision of Benjamin Hall, will evaluate the
              phylogenetic utility of sequences within the RNA polymerase II (RPB) gene.  The
              researchers will first determine if, as expected,  RPB gene sequences are
              useful for phylogenetic assessments of flowering plant taxa at the family level
              and below; they will compare phylogenies constructed from these sequences to
              phylogenies of the plant family Ericaceae (which includes rhododendrons,
              azaleas and blueberries) derived from other data.  If these results confirm
              predictions, Denton and Hall will then use RPB gene sequences to investigate
              the complex, and poorly understood, phylogenetic relationships among species of
              the large, horticulturally valuable genus Rhododendron.
