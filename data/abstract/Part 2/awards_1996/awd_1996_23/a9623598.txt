Abstract    :
              9623598  Clark    Disequilibrium of dynamics of boreal permafrost peatlands
              during transience to a warmer climate. Global general circulation models
              suggest that the greatest future temperature increases of 4-8  C will occur in
              boreal and tundra biomes. An understanding of the future dynamics of these
              systems is important in determining their role as negative or positive
              feedbacks to the global carbon cycle, especially in peatlands containing
              permafrost which may undergo dramatic change with climate warming. Permafrost
              peatlands are a potential example of systems that do not respond in equilibrium
              with climate. The PIs suggest that both local and regional factors influence
              the dynamics of boreal permafrost peatland systems and that the transient
              dynamics of these landscapes will not correspond to climatic warming in an
              equilibrial fashion due to local constraints serving as negative feedbacks to
              change. The goal of this study is to identify the relative contributions of
              regional climatic versus local autogenic processes to the successional dynamics
              in permafrost peatland landscapes. With this information, spatial cellular
              automata models will be developed to test the degree of landscape
              disequilibrium with climate by sequentially adding local feedback responses.
              The peat accumulation potential of permafrost peatlands versus melted peatlands
              will be measured to determine carbon source-sink shifts as landscapes change.
