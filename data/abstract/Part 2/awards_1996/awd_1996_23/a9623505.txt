Abstract    :
              REJMANEK  DEB-9623505  Whether or not humans indirectly affect forest
              regeneration by changing natural mammal densities is an unresolved problem. 
              Neotropical mammals may exert a significant impact on tree regeneration in
              rainforests because they are key dispersers and predators of seeds.  In many
              parts of the Neotropics, local hunters supplement their diet by killing
              medium-sized and large mammals, dramatically lowering their densities.  Since
              different mammalian herbivores have different effects on the fates of seeds and
              seedlings, we expect that the rates of seed dispersal and predation and
              seedling recruitment of trees in hunted sites will be different from those in
              unhunted sites.  Using exclosure experiments to separate the effects of
              different size classes of mammals, this project will address (1) whether  or
              not different types of herbivorous mammals differentially affect tree seed
              fates and seedling survival and (2) whether or not the effects of these mammals
              differ between unhunted and hunted portions of a wet tropical forest. 
              Addressing these issues will provide information about the efficacy of
              employing subsistence hunting as a long-term conservation tool in attempting to
              limit destruction of Neotropical forests.
