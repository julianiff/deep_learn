Abstract    :
                9623684  Mullen      This proposal is intended to develop capabilities for meV
               resolution xray optics that can be used to scan the phonon  density of states
              using the Mossbauer transitions with energies  below 30 keV. The technique,
              which has so far been applied only  to 57Fe, will permit the measurement of the
              density of phonon  states for europium and dysprosium compounds. We plan to 
              explicitly carry out such measurements on the high Tc  superconductors, as well
              as multilayer semiconductors containing  europium. Using delayed coincidence
              techniques we propose to  measure low-angle Compton scattering, to obtain new
              information  about the Fermi surface of metals.  %%%  Gamma and x-ray optics is
              at the forefront of synchrotron  radiation. We propose a new two crystal system
              of x-ray optics  that should enhance the energy resolution of synchrotron 
              monochromators by an order of magnitude. This improved technology  will make
              possible precision density of states measurements of  lattice vibrations in
              solids and new approaches to determining  the electronic properties of
              crystalline materials. These  techniques will be applied to high temperature
              superconductors,  superlattice semiconductors structures, and especially to 
              crystalline materials that can only be fabricated in millimeter  sizes where
              neutron scattering measurements are not practical.  ***
