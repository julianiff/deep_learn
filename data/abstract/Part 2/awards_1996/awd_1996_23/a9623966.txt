Abstract    :
              The  general  objective  of the research  is  to  develop  a  new  approach  for
              recognition of moving objects or parts as  well  as  extracting  and 
              classifying their trajectories.   A  prospective  application of this research
              is recognition of human gestures and  motion of body parts, such as limbs,
              fingers, etc.   The approach  is  based  on iconic recognition of image patches
              that correspond  to  object  surfaces that are roughly planar.   Each  surface 
              is  recognized separately invariant to its 3D pose, employing  affine 
              invariant   spectral  signatures  (AISS)  and   multi-dimensional  indexing  in
              the frequency domain.  The AISS are based  on  novel  Gaussian   kernels  with 
              2-dimensional  modulation   which   are  organized  in  subsets  of  distinct 
              orientations.   A   2-level  hierarchical   indexing   scheme  is  used   for  
              pose-invariant  recognition  of  flexible objects.  The indexing scheme 
              provides  pose  information  of each recognized object/part. Thus, full  3D 
              motion (including rotations) is directly available from processed  image  
              sequences.   A  novel  method  is  planned   for   motion  recognition   using 
               multi-dimensional  indexing   of   the   3D  trajectories of objects/parts. 
              The 3D trajectories of body parts  are  segmented  into motion vectors and then
              a set of  sequential  indices  is  constructed using ordered subsets  of  these
               motion  vectors.  These ordered subsets are then used to vote for model
