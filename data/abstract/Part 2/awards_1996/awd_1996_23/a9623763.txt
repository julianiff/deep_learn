Abstract    :
              9623763  MITTON   This award will provide funds for materials and supplies as
              well as extended travel for field studies in the southwestern US, Mexico and
              Guatemala related to the dissertation research of a graduate student, Scott T.
              Kelley, working with Dr. Jeffry B. Mitton at the University of Colorado,
              Boulder.  Dr. Brian Farrell, who recently left the University of Colorado to
              accept a faculty position at Harvard University, is a coPI and will be involved
              in training the student in methods of phylogenetic analysis of molecular data.
              The research project of this student has two components: 1) a combined data
              phylogenetic analysis of species relationships among bark beetles in the genus
              Dendroctonous  (Insecta: Coleoptera: Scolytidae), utilizing molecular (mtDNA)
              sequence data and morphological data and 2) population level studies of the
              degree of genetic diversity among populations of two of the species across a
              broad geographic range.  Information from both studies will be utilized to test
              hypotheses concerning dietary shifts and specializations for these wood
              destroying insects.   This award will provide support for a graduate student
              pursuing studies of the change in dietary breadth/specialization through time
              for a genus of beetles which includes some species that are major forest/timber
              pests.  The results have potential value for applied research with major
              economic implications.  Support for the training of graduate students in modern
              systematic and population biology methodologies is important for maintaining
              the workforce of scientists capable of addressing the questions and issues of
              biodiversity which are of increasing global concern.
