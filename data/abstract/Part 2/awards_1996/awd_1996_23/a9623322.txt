Abstract    :
                Abstract  Evens  9623322    Evens will continue his work on the relation
              between geometry and   representation theory. In his work with Grojnowski, he
              will study   the relationship with multiplicities of restrictions of  
              representations of real semisimple groups and dimensions of   cohomology groups
              of certain spaces. In his work with Mirkovic, he   will study characteristic
              cycles for nilpotent orbits and their   relation to certain problems in
              representation theory. He will also   study analogous problems for
              representations of Hecke algebras.    The use of symmetry in the study of
              geometrical problems has been   one of the great unifying themes of modern
              mathematics.   Ideas based on considerations of symmetry have had a profound  
              impact on elementary questions in arithmetic and on physics,   especially to
              quantum mechanics. There are certain topological   constructions which are
              analogous to the problem of counting   points in a finite set. The investigator
              plans to apply these   constructions to problems motivated by number theory and
                theoretical physics.
