Abstract    :
              This is a program of research and education centered on development of
              efficient,  formally verified CAD tools for high-level synthesis and codesign
              of digital  systems.  The notion here is to develop CAD tools which are,
              themselves, formally  verified and guaranteed to synthesize correct designs. 
              This eliminates the need  for designers to master application of formal
              methods.  The aim is to produce  code running on an embedded processor and
              custom hardware on field programmable  gate arrays.  The tools are designed to
              partition a design into hardware and  software components, to generate
              microprocessor code, and to do high-level  synthesis.  Verification is done by
              providing semantic models for the  representation languages used in the system
              (behavioral specification, register-  transfer level description, gate-level
              circuit, machine code) and proving that  the tools produce designs whose
              meanings are refinements of the meanings of their  specifications.  Theoretical
              and practical classroom courses which compliment  this research are being
              developed.
