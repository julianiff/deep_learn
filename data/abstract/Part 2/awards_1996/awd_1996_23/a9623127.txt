Abstract    :
              BOWERS  DEB-9623127  Most studies examining population dynamics in a spatial
              context assume that the size, quality, and number of  habitat patches within a
              landscape do not vary over time.  Such an assumption may be biologically
              unrealistic.  In many cases habitat patches are biological units, such as host
              plants, which may change in size or number over similar time frames as the
              populations residing within these patches.  This research will investigate the
              effects of changes in the size and number of habitat patches on the abundance
              and dynamics of an insect herbivore, the red milkweed beetle, Tetraopes
              tetraophthalmus, and its host plant common milkweed, Asclepias syriaca.  Of
              particular interest is the degree to which herbivory by the beetles is
              responsible for variation in milkweed  patch size and number.  Field
              observations will examine year to year changes in the number and size of
              milkweed patches as well as beetle abundance.   Controlled experiments will be
              used to examine the effects of herbivory by adult and larval beetles on
              milkweed growth and sexual reproduction.  Simulation modelling will be used to
              synthesize the results from the observations and experiments and investigate
              the long-term consequences of habitat variability for insect herbivores and
              their host-plants.  Knowledge gained from this research will extend our
              understanding of the effects of spatial processes, and aid in conservation
              situations where habitat change is a factor.
