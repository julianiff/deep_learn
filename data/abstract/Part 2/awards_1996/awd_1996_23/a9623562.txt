Abstract    :
              9623562  Mueller    This Dissertation Improvement research investigates job
              satisfaction and employment attachment of clergy in two Protestant
              denominations (United Church of Christ and Christian Church).  Previous
              research has found three explanations for sources of job satisfaction and
              attachment of clergy employed in parish ministry.  These include: (1) internal
              satisfaction--clergy have a strong service orientation and are responding to a
              "higher calling"  to the ministry, (2) internal and external
              satisfaction--along with internal satisfaction there is the external family
              support and congregational paternalism involving discretionary benefits, and
              (3) professional model--the clergy are employees of organizations and work
              conditions influence job satisfaction and attachment like any other employees. 
              This research will empirically assess these validity of the three explanations
              through developing an integrated model of clergy satisfaction and attachment
              that combines variables from all three.  Data will be collected through a mail
              survey of a probability sample of approximately 2,400 clergy.
