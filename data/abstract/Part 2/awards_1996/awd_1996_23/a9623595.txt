Abstract    :
              9623595  Adanur   Being able to rapidly produce aligned polymer fiber composite
              structures today limits their use in mid to high volume products.  This CAREER
              award will investigate new approaches that draw on textile manufacturing
              technologies to produce net shape resin impregnated composite preforms rapidly
              and reliably.  The educational program of course and curriculum development
              will complement the research program, but also build the infrastructure at
              Auburn University for a Textile Engineering program accredited by the
              Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).  The research plan
              calls for modeling and experimental investigation of two innovative new
              thermoplastic composite manufacturing processes.  One process involves
              spreading the fibers in the yarns so that they can be more easily impregnating
              with resin, which is followed by returning the fibers to yarn that is made into
              a preform and cured.  The other process uses a new concept for resin
              impregnation just before braiding and weaving.  A well thought out curriculum
              development plan emphasizes engineered textiles as a product, but also the
              machines and systems needed to produce them.  A structural textile composites
              laboratory will complement and connect the research and education aspects of
              this project.   Technical breakthroughs in making near net shape composite
              structures will greatly reduce the cost and potential for high performance
              aligned fiber composites.  The educational plan will develop a new look in
              textile engineering curriculum that prepares textile engineers for new
              opportunities.
