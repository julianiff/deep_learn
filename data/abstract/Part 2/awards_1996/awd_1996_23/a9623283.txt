Abstract    :
                9623283  Conrad    This  project  will  investigate how structural  defects 
              on  length  scales  approaching 2 nm will  affect  the  magnetic  properties.  
               The  project  has  technological   importance  because the demand for higher
              storage densities in recording  media is expected to push magnetic clusters
              sizes below a  2  nm  radius.   A  novel set of patterned tungsten  substrates 
              will  be  used  to  carry out such a study.  These  surfaces  consist  of  a 
              periodic staircase with each step  one  atom  high.  By  controlled growth
              conditions, 2-dimensional  iron  films can be forced to grow out from the
              substrate steps  to  produce  equal  spaced one-dimensional magnetic  wires. 
              The  gaps between these wires play the role of imperfections in a 
              2-dimensional magnetic film. Since both wire width (2 to  10  atoms   and  wire
               separation  (1  to  20  atoms)   can   be  independently  varied,  we will
              explore  finite  wire  width  effects  and  coupling between isolated wires  on
               the  iron  film's  magnetic properties. The work will  be  carried  out  using
               a  combination of high resolution Low Energy Electron  Diffraction,  Surface 
              Magneto-Optical  Kerr   effect,   and  Scanning Tunneling Microscopy.  %%%  The
               influence of atomic defects on magnetic film properties  will   play  an 
              important  role  in  developing  the   next  generation  of high density
              recording media. The demand  for  higher storage densities is expected to push
              the diameter of  magnetic  clusters down to sizes of 6 to  10  atoms.  It  is 
              therefore  important  to understand how magnetic  properties  are  affected by
              limiting the magnetic films to contain less  than  100 atoms. We have devised a
              novel technique  to  grow  arrays of thin (3 to 10 atoms wide) parallel
              magnetic wires.  These  wires  will be used to study how wire  thickness  and 
              wire  separation  influence their magnetic  properties.  The  critical  wire 
              thickness required  to  develop  a  magnetic  moment  and the effects of
              neighboring wires on th e magnetic  properties of an individual wire will be
              studied.  ***
