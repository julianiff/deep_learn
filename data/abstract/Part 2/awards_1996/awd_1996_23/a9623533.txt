Abstract    :
                Abstract  Savin  9623533       Savin will continue his work on   exceptional
              dual pair correspondences,   over p-adic and real fields, with applications to 
               automorphic forms, in particular to the construction of   a motive with Galois
              group G2.      A purpose of this research is to get a better understanding   of
              zeroes of polynomials. Almost everybody knows how to   solve a quadratic
              equation. It is also possible, although   it is less known, to find zeroes of
              any polynomial of   degree 3 or 4. A higher degree polynomial, in general, can
              not    be solved, but can be studied by attaching to it a mathematical   object
              called the Galois group. Conversly, one can ask the following   question: given
              a Galois group, can you find a polynomial   corresponding to that group? The
              aim of this research is to give a   positive answer to this question for a
              class of groups of type G2(p).   The degrees of corresponding polynomials are,
              roughly speaking,   the 6th power of the prime number p.  For p=5 it is around
              6 billion!   This research  will provide a good understanding of such
              polynomials.
