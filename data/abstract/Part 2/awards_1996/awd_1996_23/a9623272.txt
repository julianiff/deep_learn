Abstract    :
              With support from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Mark Smith   of
              The University of Arizona is continuing his studies on the kinetics of   low
              temperature reactions.  In the past, he has used resonance-enhanced  
              multiphoton ionization detection to study (a) collisions of neutral   molecules
              or radicals in a free jet at very low temperatures, and (b)   radical reactions
              in a pulsed equilibrium axisymmetric supersonic flow   reactor (Laval nozzle)
              between 80 and 250K.  Next, he will extend the   free jet studies by
              incorporating single-state preparation and/or   state-selective probes.  He
              will also continue his investigations of the   60-300K chemistry of hydroxyl
              radicals, chlorine atoms and other reactive   oxygen-containing radicals with a
              variety of atmospherically relevant   reactants.    Broad based investigations
              will be made into the mechanism and dynamics   of gas phase chemical reactions
              at temperatures between 300 and 1K.  The   primary goals of this work include
              the refinement of the developing   understanding of very low energy collision
              phenomena as well as the   provision of absolute reaction rates and product
              branching ratios.  Such   measurements are critically needed for the modeling
              of planetary   atmospheric, cometary, circumstellar and interstellar chemical  
              environments.
