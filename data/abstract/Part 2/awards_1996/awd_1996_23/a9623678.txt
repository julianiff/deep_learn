Abstract    :
              9623678  Gilbert   The goal of this research is to examine dormancy mechanisms
              and costs associated with different dormancy strategies in the rotifer
              Synchaeta pectinata, a common member of lake zooplankton communities.  For
              organisms that, like rotifers, are incapable of migrating from their
              environment, dormancy is commonly employed to allow persistence through
              inhospitable periods.  Cues for entering dormancy (e.g., temperature, food
              levels, etc.) may often be unreliable, resulting in substantial fitness costs
              for organisms that either enter dormancy too soon or too late.  The freshwater
              lake environments of S. pectinata are prone to drastic weather-induced changes
              in basic attributes including water turbulence, temperature, oxygen , pH,
              nutrient availability. S. pectinata produces short-term dormant eggs in
              response to food limitation.  This strategy is hypothesized to promote survival
              through short periods of starvation conditions.  Dormant egg production varies
              widely between clonal lines, suggesting multiple strategies for dealing with
              unpredictable conditions.  Research funded by this award will integrate
              laboratory and field experiments with computer simulations to compare the
              success of alternate dormancy strategies under different environmental
              conditions.  This research will contribute to our understanding of how the
              capacity for dormancy can allow populations to persist in variable or
              temporally risky environments.  As zooplankton are a key component of
              freshwater lake ecosystems, understanding the mechanisms that promote their
              persistance should enhance the efforts of land use planners and management
              agencies to manage for watershed health and integrity.
