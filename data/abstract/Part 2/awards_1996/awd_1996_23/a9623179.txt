Abstract    :
              9623179  Eastman    This award supports an international conference on 
              "Mechanical Properties of Interfacial Materials" held  in Hawaii, 14-19 January
              1996.  The format offers  many opportunities for discussion of scientific 
              issues dealing with effects of interfacial properties  on mechanical behavior. 
              Invited overview talks  include mechanisms of deformation, grain boundary 
              design, interfacial fracture, bioceramics,  nanostructures, interface bonding,
              composite design  and multilayer composites,, and impurity segregation 
              effects.  Support is provided for young scientists,  engineers and graduate
              students to attend the  meeting.  ***
