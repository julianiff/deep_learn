              Communication         Within all animal societies, most of an individual s 
              social interactions are carried out by means of  communication.  Yet the role
              of communication in social  behavior remains controversial, in part because it
              has been  difficult to integrate information about the adaptive  significance
              of signaling for both senders and receivers  within the same system.  In the
              subsocial treehopper,  Umbonia crassicornis, communication between parents and 
              offspring plays a critical role in their response to  predation.  Females
              produce only a single clutch of young,  and thus there is a high overlap of
              interests between parent  and offspring about the extent of parental investment
              in  offspring defense.  The fitness costs and benefits of  signaling are
              therefore shared by both senders and  receivers.  This study will address the
              benefits of  signaling by quantifying the effectiveness of the parents  
              anti-predatory response, that is evoked by nymphal signals.  The costs of
              signaling will be addressed by manipulating  female investment in offspring
              defense, to determine whether  current benefits accrued by evoking parental
              defense are  offset by a reduction in parental survivorship and potential  for
              future defense.  The proposed research should be of  general interest within
              the fields of animal communication  and social evolution.
