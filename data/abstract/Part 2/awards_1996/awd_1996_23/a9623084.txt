Abstract    :
              DMI-9623084  Vydyanathan   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project is aimed at optimizing the approach of coulombic pairing of
              dopants-feasibility of which was demonstrated in Phase I-to produce high
              conductivity p-type GaN for blue LEDs and lasers.   Avyd Devices' approach to
              create shallow acceptors entails the coulombic pairing of a double acceptor
              with a single donor with the resulting pair acting as a single acceptor in its
              unpaired style. Specifically, GaN crystals will be simultaneously doped with an
              element from group I and an element from group IV or group Vl and then the
              crystals will be annealed under well controlled thermodynamic conditions which
              would promote the association of the group I element occupying gallium lattice
              sites, acting as a double acceptor with the group IV or group VI element
              occupying gallium or nitrogen lattice site acting as a single donor.  The
              resulting pair would act as a single acceptor with an expected energy level
              much closer to the valence band edge than that of either the first or second
              level of the group I acceptors in their unpaid state. Phase II research will
              focus on optimizing the coulombic pairing approach to create acceptor levels at
              50 meV above to value band edge in GaN-much shallower than that Mg in GaN-and
              demonstrate prototype blue LEDs with superior brightness; by reducing the
              acceptor level from 150 meV for Mg to less than 50 meV with coulombic pairs, an
              increase in ionization by a factor of 200 is expected at room temperature. 
              Creation of shallow  acceptor levels at 50 meV above the valence band edge
              would also open the possibility of realizing the ultimate goal of blue lasers
              in the nitride system.    High power blue light emitting diodes (LEDs) for
              displays, traffic lights High power blue laser diodes for optics data storage.
