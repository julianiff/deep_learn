Abstract    :
              9623203  Chen    This proposal is directed toward research on nonlinear problems
              in fluid   mechanics and related partial differential equations, along with the
              analysis   and development of efficient nonlinear methods. The objective of
              this   proposed research program is threefold: investigate important  
              multidimensional nonlinear problems such as geometric flows, transonic   flows,
              and the Riemann problem to find the correct function spaces in which   to pose
              the multidimensional hyperbolic conservation laws and in which to   develop the
              numerical algorithms that converge stably and rapidly; analyze   and develop
              existing shock capturing methods and related potential   techniques to
              formulate new, more efficient nonlinear methods and to solve   global solutions
              of the nonlinear systems; probe in the regularizing   mechanism for nonlinear
              partial differential equations to gain new physical   insights and to guide the
              formulation of the efficient nonlinear methods.    The nonlinear problems arise
              in all areas of science and engineering. In   particular, they arise in
              material sciences, biophysics, and environmental   and global change processes,
              in which fluid motions are essential features.   Such features are predominant
              in such areas as elasticity, plasticity,   semiconductor, biological transport
              of ions, phase transition, multi-phase   process, and combustion. The fluid
              motions are generally governed by the   principles of fluid mechanics and, in
              turn, by certain nonlinear systems of   partial differential equations. 
              Understanding solutions of such nonlinear   systems enables ones to understand
              the corresponding fluid motions, to gain   new physical insights, to discover
              the intrinsic laws in these areas. The   proposed nonlinear problems include
              the well-posedness of solutions of   these nonlinear systems and the
              qualitative behavior of new nonlinear   phenomena as well as the analysis and
              development of numerical   computational methods and related potential
              nonlinear methods.
