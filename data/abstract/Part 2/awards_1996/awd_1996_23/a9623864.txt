Abstract    :
              96233864  Chen  The objective of the research is to develop:  A suitable 
              turbulence model for accurately predicting room airflows; A  detailed numerical
              method for calculating the emissions from  building materials; A simplified
              method of determining material  emissions for industrial use; A procedure to
              investigate the  impact of material emission on indoor air quality and building
               energy consumption.    The method used will be the
              computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD)  technique with a two-layer turbulence mode.
               The CFD code will be  validated by detailed flow and thermal measurements in a
              full-  scale test chamber and by emission data obtained from a small-  scale
              and a full-scale test chamber of stainless steel.    The research will
              investigate material emission, indoor air  quality, thermal comfort and energy
              consumption of buildings  simultaneously for the first time.  The results of
              this project  will provide the basis for the development or improvement of 
              industrial standards for material testing for obtaining reliable  emission
              data.  This will help building designers and owners to  select various types of
              building materials for better indoor air  quality.    This education will
              strengthen the Building Technology Program at  MIT.  This provides a unique
              opportunity for engineering and  architectural students to obtain experienced
              work with colleagues  in the complementary field in the design of healthy
              buildings  with energy efficiency.  The curriculums to be developed can also 
              be used by other schools and organizations.  ***
