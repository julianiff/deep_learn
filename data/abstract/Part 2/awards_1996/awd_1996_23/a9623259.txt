Abstract    :
              Ulrich  9623259    This proposal supports the work of Professor B. Ulrich to
              work on problems in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. he intends to
              study the Rees algebra and its associated graded ring. In particular the
              proposed research investigates how graded rings associated with an ideal
              intertwine with the Cohen-Macaulay property. He also intends to study problems
              that circle around the classical problems of determining the classical join and
              secant varieties for certain factor rings. Finally, he intends to study  the
              scheme associated to the source and target of finite morphisms between perfect
              R modules and certain Cohen-Macaulay rings.     This research is on the
              boundary between commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Both fields  arose
              from the classical problem of studying mathematical objects defined in the
              plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the fields use
              methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and
              conversely are extensively used in those fields.  Moreover it has proved itself
              useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science,
              cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
