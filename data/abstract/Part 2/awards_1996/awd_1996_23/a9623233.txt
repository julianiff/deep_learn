Abstract    :
              9623233  Stewart  This career development plan contains both research and 
              education activities.  The objective of the research is  to form a genetic
              basis for biofilm detachment.  The  hypothesis of the research is that there
              are genes that  actively control the process of sloughing detachment,  and that
              these genes are regulated by cellular  environment or physiological status. 
              The objective  would be to develop methods to induce these genes to  control
              biofouling in a more cost effective and  environmentally acceptable manner than
              the current  heavy reliance on biocidal chemicals.  The goal of the 
              educational plan is for the PI to develop excellence as  a teacher.  This
              includes a set of well thought-out  activities to improve teaching technique.
