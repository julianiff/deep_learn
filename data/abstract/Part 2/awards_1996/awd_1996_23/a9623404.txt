Abstract    :
              9623404  Avise   The research funded in this award represents a merging of the
              fields of behavior and molecular genetics.  The study takes advantage of a
              unique opportunity to test theory on the evolution of behavioral differences
              between the sexes.  Research will be carried out on Syngnathus typhle, the
              broad-nosed pipefish.  Male pipefishes and seahorses carry developing young on
              their bodies, often in a fully enclosed pouch, and provide nutrients, aeration
              and protection for the developing young.  This male "pregnancy" results in a
              reversal of the usual sex roles, wherein  females compete for access to mates
              and males tend to be choosier. By using DNA fingerprinting techniques, field
              experiments will determine how often males in natural environments receive eggs
              from multiple females and will test whether females in nature mate with
              multiple males.  These findings will place behavioral experiments performed in
              the laboratory into a broader evolutionary context.  Second, breeding
              experiments in the laboratory will test whether population sex ratio influences
              competition among females for mates. Third, manipulations will be conducted to
              test for  competition among eggs from different mothers when carried by the
              same male.  Findings from this research will advance the understanding of the
              evolution of behavior and provide important information for fisheries
              biologists working to conserve biodiversity in this enigmatic and diverse group
              of fishes.
