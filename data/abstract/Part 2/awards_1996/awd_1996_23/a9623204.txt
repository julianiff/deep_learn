Abstract    :
              9623204  LJUNGGREN         In 1996, Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth 
              Observatory will operate the research vessel MAURICE EWING in  support of
              NSF-sponsored research.  The EWING is a 230'  general purpose research vessel
              with specialized capability in  marine geology and geophysics.  The vessel is
              owned by the National  Science Foundation and operated by Lamont-Doherty
              through a 5-year  charter agreement.  The EWING is capable of operating world
              wide  and will support cruises in the south Pacific Ocean and the north 
              Atlantic Ocean in 1996.  The ship is scheduled for 319 operational  days in
              1996, of which 315 are in support of NSF-sponsored marine  geology and
              geophysics programs.        This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National
              Science  Foundation in support of oceanographic research.  Most  oceanographic
              projects require highly specialized equipment and  extensive support from the
              ship's crew members.  Increasingly  research projects require equipment which
              must be permanently  installed on the vessel, thus requiring specialized
              vessels.  These  vessels do not operate the same as general cargo/fishing
              vessels,  therefore NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels 
              specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated  by
              universities and research institutes around the country.     ***
