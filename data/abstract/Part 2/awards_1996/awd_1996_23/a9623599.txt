Abstract    :
              9623599  Gale    This CAREER program focuses on research with closely linked 
              educational activities related to joining of intermetallic  compounds to
              conventional nickel-base superalloys. Transient  liquid phase (TLP) bonding is
              examined as a technique for  bonding structural intermetallics since it is
              tolerant of  limited low temperature ductility and stable oxide formation 
              often exhibited by such alloy systems.  The research aims to  elucidate the
              mechanisms controlling processing structure  property relationships in nickel
              aluminide/superalloy joints  and thereby demonstrate routes for improved
              microstructural  control.  The formulation of suitable process modeling tools 
              are a vital part of the research. A difficulty often  encountered by students
              is establishing interconnections in  terms of shared and linked concepts
              between different  aspects of science. The educational part of the program 
              develops an educational module on intermetallic alloy to  superalloy joining
              that illustrates key aspects of materials  science with appropriate emphasis on
              microstructural  development, materials processing, mechanical properties, 
              kinetics and thermodynamics.  This module will include  multimedia teaching
              resources and inclass demonstrations.  %%%  The field of intermetallic
              compounds constitutes a major  research activity both within the  US and
              worldwide.  Suitable methodologies are needed for initial fabrication  and post
              service repair.  The joining of intermetallics to  conventional materials, such
              as superalloys, is particularly  important as intermetallics are likely to be
              used locally  within engineering systems composed predominantly of such 
              materials.  ***
