Abstract    :
                   Thomas 9623031  Thomas will carry out and supervise research in graph
              theory with  emphasis on structural characterizations of various properties of 
              graphs. Thomas will also develop efficient practical algorithms based on this
              research. The areas of interest are Hadwiger's conjecture, spatial embeddings
              of graphs, applications of graph theory to  low-dimensional topology,
              generalizations of the four-color theorem, graphs on surfaces with particular
              emphasis on coloring and hamiltonicity, linkage and subdivision problems, and
              infinite graphs.     Graph theory is a subdiscipline of combinatorics.
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete
              collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is
              extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design of large
              networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of
              algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this
              makes use of combinatorial research. In addition, enumerative  information from
              combinatorics research has been of use in the design  of geometric algorithms
              for problems in robotics and motion planning.
