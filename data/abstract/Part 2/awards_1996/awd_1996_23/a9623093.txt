Abstract    :
              9310328  Mallet-Paret  We propose to study fundamental qualitative properties of
              several  classes of dynamical systems which arise in various areas of science. 
              Among the systems of interest are those involving geometric theory of 
              singularly perturbed differential equations, differential delay  equations, and
              associated linear problems.    We propose to study fundamental qualitative
              properties of several  classes of dynamical systems which arise in various
              areas of science.  The dynamical systems model a wide range of important
              phenomena in a  number of areas of science.  Among them are problems of cell 
              population growth (modeling various disease processes), problems of  fluid
              flow, and problems involving interaction of diffusion and  chemical reaction.
