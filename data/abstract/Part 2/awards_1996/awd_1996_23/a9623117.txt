Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is a broad  study on the syntheses and   metabolism
              of chlorophylls and derivatives.  The biosynthetic origin of   macrocyclic
              carbons in the bacteriochlorophyll-e will be investigated and   the degradation
              of the molecules in senescent bacteria studied.    Synthetic studies will be
              aimed at the production of a variety of targets   including
              3,8-divinylchlorophyll-a, isochlorophyll-a, a conformationally   locked
              phytochromobilin and a series of non-planar porphyrins and   chlorins.  Stable
              phlorins and corroles will also be constructed with the   goal of producing
              bis-macrocycles. With this award, the Synthetic Organic   Program is supporting
              the research of Dr. Kevin M. Smith of the   Department of Chemistry at the
              University of California, Davis.  Dr.   Smith will focus his work on a
              broad-based and wide-ranging study of the   biosynthesis, catabolism, chemistry
              and spectroscopy of novel porphyrins,   chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls. 
               Chlorophylls are the catalysts   in the vital process of photosynthesis and
              are involved in light   gathering as well as the process of charge separation. 
              Certain   porphyrins and their metal complexes are to be studied as biomimics
              of   chlorophylls found in photosynthetic organisms and as molecules with  
              potential biomedical implications.
