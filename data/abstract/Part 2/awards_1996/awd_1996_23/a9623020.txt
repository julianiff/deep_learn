Abstract    :
              Shen  9623020       The investigator develops fast algorithms and robust 
              software for elliptic problems and constructs, analyzes, and  implements fast
              and accurate schemes for numerical simulation of  unsteady incompressible
              flows.  The numerical simulation of  incompressible flows, which plays an
              important role in numerous  scientific and industrial applications of current
              interest, is a  challenging task for both numerical analysts and computational 
              dynamicists.  The proposed fast algorithms are based on the  spectral
              discretization for the space variables and high-order  projection schemes for
              the time variable.  The proposed algorithms  allow accurate numerical
              simulation of incompressible flows with  significantly less computational
              effort than the traditional  lower-order methods.       Fast and accurate
              numerical solution of partial differential  equations is of major importance in
              many fields of science and  engineering, including among others high
              performance computing,  turbulence modeling and numerical weather prediction. 
              A main  objective of this project is to develop fast algorithms with  optimal
              computational complexity for a large class of elliptic  equations, and to
              implement them in a high performance software  package that is made available
              to the public through anonymous  ftp and World Wide Web.  It is expected that
              the proposed fast  algorithms and software will become an important tool for
              many  scientists and engineers.
