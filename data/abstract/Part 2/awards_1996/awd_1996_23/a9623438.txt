Abstract    :
              9623438  Bauman     The principal investigator will study elliptic and parabolic
               systems  of partial differential equations (with physically realistic  initial
                and boundary conditions) from physical models in two and three  space 
              dimensions.  In particular, the Ginzburg-Landau system describing  the current
              and magnetic field in a superconducting material  subject  to an external
              magnetic field will be studied.  The principal  investigator will also study
              nonlinear systems describing  hyperelastic  materials based on models developed
              by materials scientists.  %%%     The above problems concern realistic
              mathematical models for  the  behavior of materials which are of practical
              interest in  materials  engineering, materials science, mechanical engineering,
              and  physics.  Issues to be studied include how the modulus of the external 
              field  affects current and magnetic field in a superconducting material,  and 
              how defects and inhomogeneities in a material affect its  superconductivity. 
              Problems of this nature are important in applications such as in  the  use of
              superconducting materials for power transmission and the  use of  liquid
              crystals for displaying complex internal information.  ***
