Abstract    :
              DMS-9623008  PI:  Albert Sheu  University of Kansas    The proposer will
              continue his research on the interaction between   C*-algebras and geometry,
              with emphasis on the groupoid C*-algebra   approach to quantum groups and
              deformation quantization. Topics to   be studied include the realization of
              quantum groups as groupoid   C*-algebras, leaf-preserving and group-preserving
              deformation   quantizations of concrete Poisson Lie groups, holomorphic
              foliation   and deformation quantization, and the cancellation problem for   
              group C*-algebras. The main tools to be used in this research will   be from
              various mathematical branches like C*-algebras, Lie   groups, differential
              geometry, and pseudodifferential operators.     This research is motivated by
              the recent worldwide interest in   the noncommutative aspect of geometry
              originated from the concept   of quantization which links together several
              branches of mathematics   and quantum physics. In the physical sciences, it is
              important to study   the invariance of quantities under various symmetry group
              actions. The   theory of quantum groups generalizes the classical theory of
              symmetry   groups and provides new and promising directions in the study of  
              quantum physics. By studying the structure of quantum groups in a   new way and
              by exploring related questions, the proposer hopes to   contribute to the
              understanding of this relatively new and exciting   area of mathematics.
