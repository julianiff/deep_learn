Abstract    :
              This project uses a powerful approach for studying species invasion by combining
              methods of evolutionary genetics and physiological ecology.  The focus is on
              the invasion of freshwater habitats by a marine and estuarine planktonic
              copepod, Eurytemora affinis.  Two alternative hypotheses could account for its
              invasion of freshwater habitats.  Freshwater colonizations have been (A)
              multiple independent events, or (B) rare events followed by dispersal among
              similar habitats.  The goals of this project are (1) to test these hypotheses
              by reconstructing the history of colonization, (2) to determine changes in
              physiological traits during habitat transitions, and (3) to determine whether
              habitat transitions occur through genetic adaptation or acclimation.  The
              history and geographic pathway of colonization will be determined by
              constructing a phylogeny of 12 populations of copepods from different
              salinities using DNA sequences from two genes.  Breadth of salinity tolerance
              will be determined for 6 populations, then mapped onto the phylogeny to
              determine how physiological traits change during habitat transitions.  Response
              to changes in salinity will be measured to determine whether habitat
              transitions involve genetic adaptation of populations or individual
              acclimation.    The introduction of exotic species into aquatic habitats is an
              issue of major environmental concern.  This research will reveal important
              processes involved in habitat transitions, and contribute to our understanding
              of habitat invasions, local adaptation, as well as intraspecific genetic and
              physiological diversity.
