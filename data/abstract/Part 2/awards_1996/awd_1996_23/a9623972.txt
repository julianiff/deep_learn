Abstract    :
              9623972  Wirtz    The  main  research  objective of this CAREER  grant  is  to 
              establish  a prominent program with a focus on the  dynamics  of  complex 
              fluids and macromolecules.  Novel experimental,  numerical,  and theoretical
              methods are being  developed  to  investigate the structure and dynamics of
              complex fluids and  macromolecular   assemblies   These   experimental  
              methods  involve  the  measurement of the structural and  rheological 
              properties  of  either  individual aggregates  or  molecules  (microscopy)  or 
              of  an ensemble of colloids/macromolecules  (scattering  and  rheology).  
              These  experimental   methods  include (i) magnetic tweezers to
              micro-manipulate individual  biological  macromolecules such as DNA and
              proteins  in  the  bulk  and near interfaces, (ii) high-resolution fluorescence
               microcopy   to  image  the  Brownian  motion  of  individual  biological   
              macromolecules,   vesicles,   and    colloidal  aggregates  (iii) diffusive
              wave spectroscopy to  probe  the  collective  dynamics  and  the quiescent 
              micro-rheology  of  concentrated  colloidal  suspensions,  microemulsions,  
              and  polymer   solutions.   To  analyze  these   scattering   and  microscopy 
              experiments, Monte Carlo and molecular  dynamics  simulations, as well as
              stochastic equations of  motion  are  being developed to describe the
              non-equilibrium dynamics  of  complex fluids and macromolecules in external
              force fields.  %%%  This research will provide a direct test of theories of 
              gel  electrophoresis  and will help improve current  theories  of  gene therapy
              and polymer-based drug-delivery systems.  These  new   tools   will  also 
              offer  a  direct  way   to   probe  conformational and transport-properties
              changes  induced  by  DNA-DNA,   protein-DNA,  and  protein-protein 
              interactions,  which  have  implications  on the design,  development,  and 
              testing of new drugs.  ***
