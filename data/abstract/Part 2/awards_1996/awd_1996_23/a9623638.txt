Abstract    :
               9623638  Simpson   Graduate student Todd Barkman, with direction from adviser
              Beryl Simpson at the University of Texas, is studying an interesting problem in
              plant evolution and distribution in Southeast Asia.  The focus of the project
              is the orchid genus Dendrochilum and the 20-30 species of subsection
              Eurybrachium that occur mostly on the large island of Borneo, with many on Mt.
              Kinabalu alone.  Field collections will augment herbarium materials to enable
              detailed morphological study of vegetative and floral characters; field work
              capitalizes on the floristic inventory activities of Prof. John Beaman and his
              Malaysian and Indonesian colleagues.  In addition, molecular (DNA) analyses of
              nuclear and chloroplast genes will add new data for measuring mutational
              differences between the species and for inferring phylogenetic relationships. 
              Related groups on the islands of Sumatra, Java, and Sulawesi, and in the
              Philippines and Malaysia will also be studied for phylogenetic comparisons.  A
              robust phylogeny of the species will test two competing hypotheses for the
              origin of these epiphytic orchids.  One hypothesis claims adaptive radiation on
              Borneo from a single ancestral introduction; the second hypothesis claims
              multiple introductions from different islands around Borneo.  %%%   The
              integration of traditional morphological characters with new molecular data
              from DNA sequencing promises a more reliable taxonomy of plants and the robust
              inference of phylogenetic (genealogical) relationships among species.  With
              this phylogeny in place, patterns of historical biogeography (migration,
              adaptive radiations, speciation) can be analyzed.  Barkman and Simpson's study
              of Dendrochilum orchids is one further example of this rejuvenated plant
              systematics.  ***
