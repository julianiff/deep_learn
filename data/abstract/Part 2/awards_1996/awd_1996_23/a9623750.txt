Abstract    :
              9623750  Sullivan         Mississippi's eight public universities are graduating
               minority students in science, mathematics, engineering, and  technology (SMET)
              fields in unprecedented numbers!  The success of  the Mississippi Alliance for
              Minority Participation (MAMP) in  causing this increase over the past four
              years has been the direct  result of a true partnership among member
              institutions which  features the sharing of resources to achieve a common goal.
               The  Mississippi Alliance, especially at the historically white  universities,
              has a growing enrollment trend in SMET disciplines.   Together, these eight
              institutions increased in the B.S. degrees  granted to minority students in
              SMET from 288 in 1991 to 472 in  1995.  The dramatically increased pool of SMET
              minority students  now in the pipeline for graduate school dictates an added
              focus for  MAMP in the Phase II.  We must help these students more effectively 
              to earn graduate degrees in SMET.         MAMP Phase II objectives are:      
              1.  To increase the number of minority SMET graduates from 543       annually
              in 1996 to 782 annually by 2001, a forty-four percent       (44%) increase over
              the five-year period.              2.  To significantly increase the number of
              minority students       who enroll in graduate programs.         3.  To
              significantly increase the number and percentage of       minority students
              enrolled in SMET at the historically white       institutions.         4.  To
              significantly increase the retention rates at all MAMP       universities.     
                 5.  To forge cooperative links with business and government       across the
              state and region.         To achieve these objectives, MAMP will build on the
              experience  of the past four years in developing and implementing strategies 
              which are focused on empowering students to take responsibility for  their own
              success.  These strategies were developed with the  assistance of students,
              whose participation in the design of  activities will continue to guide the
              framework  of the MAMP  approach.  In addition to the bridge to graduate
              school, activities  to be emphasized will include peer mentoring and study
              groups;  workshops; undergraduate research, both academic year and summer; 
              summer bridge programs for freshmen and community college transfer  students;
              drop-in centers; stipends; outreach programs with pre-  college students;
              recruitment; and curriculum reform.  Formative  evaluation will provide the
              necessary continuous feedback required  for maximum success.  Dissemination
              activities will be expanded  from primarily an inter-institutional focus to the
              region and  beyond.
