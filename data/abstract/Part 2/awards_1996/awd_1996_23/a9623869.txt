Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT    Nowicki & Weiss  IBN 96-23869    Functional Analysis of Female
              Reproductive Coloration         Female choice, male-male mate competition, and 
              resulting sexually dimorphic traits have been a primary  focus in studies of
              animal behavior.  Relatively new to the  field of animal behavior is the
              concept that species with  conventional sex-roles may exhibit female-female
              mate  competition and male choosiness.  Such reproductive patterns  may be an
              important selective force in the evolution of  communication signals.      
              This proposal proposes a study of the communicative  function of female
              reproductive coloration in the sexually  dimorphic lizard, Sceloporus virgatus
              (Sauria: Iguanidae).  It will be determined whether this coloration is used in 
              female-female mate competition, functioning to attract  choosy males into a
              female s home range during her receptive  period.  To test this and other
              hypotheses concerning the  function of female reproductive coloration, this
              research  will (1) determine how changes in coloration and display  behavior
              are temporally associated with seasonal changes in  reproductive state, (2)
              determine whether aspects of female  quality are correlated with color patch
              characteristics, and  (3) experimentally examine the effect of female
              coloration  and display behavior on the behavior of conspecific males  using a
              choice test paradigm.
