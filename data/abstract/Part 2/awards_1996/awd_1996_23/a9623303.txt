Abstract    :
              9623303  Dorit   Ribozymes are the smallest biological molecules capable of
              transmitting genetic information and of carrying out biochemical functions.   
              In the research funded by this award,  new biological activities for these RNA
              enzymes will be generated using a novel experimental in vitro system.  These
              experiments explore the molecular basis of biocatalysis, and the ease with
              which novel enzymatic functions may be evolved.  Such questions, fundamental to
              an understanding of cellular metabolism, have previously been considered only
              in a theoretical context.  The work conducted under this award will reveal the
              catalytic versatility of these experimentally tractable and biologically
              important molecules, and help establish guidelines for the development and
              design of biomolecules of potential diagnostic, therapeutic and environmental
              utility.
