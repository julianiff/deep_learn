Abstract    :
              A user-callable geometry library in C++ will be developed.  The  software
              package will include documented C++ libraries, a user  manual, sample drivers,
              and sample data sets.  It will be  distributed on the Internet and diskette and
              announced through  conferences and publications.    Implementation in C++ will
              make the software accessible to the  computational geometry community and to an
              increasing number of  programmers in scientific computing.  The library can
              advance  science and engineering by reducing software development time for  its
              users.    The library is small enough to be completed quickly, yet provide  a
              basis for future expansion.  The project will encompass the  four layers
              identified for geometry libraries, namely, geometric  primitives,  algorithms,
              support environment, and applications.  The support environment  will include
              sample drivers, sample  data, and an interface to Geomview, the visualization
              software  from the Geometry Center at the University of Minnesota.  ***
