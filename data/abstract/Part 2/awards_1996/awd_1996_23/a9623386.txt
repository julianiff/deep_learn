Abstract    :
              9623386  JANSEN  This award will provide funds for materials and supplies as
              well as travel funds for detailed population studies in the southeastern United
              States.  The support will enhance the dissertation of Carolyn Ferguson who is a
              graduate student with Dr. Robert Jansen at University of Texas, Austin.  The
              student's dissertation project involves phylogenetic analysis of molecular
              sequence data for taxa in the Phlox pilosa species complex.  This group of
              plants is of particular interest because it has been suggested that some of the
              taxa are of hybrid origin at the diploid level, a speciation mechanism that is
              presumed to be rare and bears further investigation.  Data will be obtained for
              chloroplast restriction site analysis and nuclear ITS sequencing and
              incongruities in the resultant phylogenies should illuminate the question of
              diploid hybrid origins.  In addition, molecular markers will be utilized in
              detailed population level studies for a case study of putative Phlox diploid
              hybridization in the southeastern United States.    This award will provide
              support for a graduate student pursuing studies of relationships among plants
              in a species complex including taxa believed to be of diploid hybrid origin. 
              Careful population level analysis will document this interesting and believed
              rare mechanism for the origin of species. Support for the training of graduate
              students in modern systematic and population biology methodologies is important
              for maintaining the workforce of scientists capable of addressing the questions
              and issues of biodiversity which are of increasing global concern.
