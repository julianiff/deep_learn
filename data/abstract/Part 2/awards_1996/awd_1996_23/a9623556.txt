Abstract    :
                9623556  Moore      The complexity of bird migration derives from a wide array
              of factors.  Physiology, behavior, ecology, and  the physical environment shape
              and constrain observable patterns of migrant spatial and temporal distribution,
              behavior, and ecology.  The sum of these patterns can be considered the overall
              "migration strategy" for dealing with the challenge of seasonal long-distance
              movements.  While a diversity of migration strategies exist among species of
              migratory birds, individuals of different ages or genders within  a species
              also exhibit differences in migratory behavior.  The question of how such
              within-species differences are mediated and why these differences occur is the
              focus of this award.  The research will identify the causes and ecological
              consequences of differential migration of male and female intercontinental
              migratory songbirds.  Two hypotheses will be tested: 1) differential migration
              is the direct result of male-female competition or has evolved as a means of
              eliminating such competition through divergent use of resources; and 2)
              differential migration is a result of gender-based variation in the costs of
              reproduction and survival.    Findings will identify environmental factors that
              facilitate successful migration in songbirds.  In so doing, the research will
              contribute to the management and conservation of songbird populations and
              biodiversity.  As bird species exert strong controls over insect pest
              populations in some forest ecosystems, research aimed at their conservation has
              implications for the integrity and health of forest resources.
