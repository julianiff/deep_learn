Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT  Proposal: DMS-9623082  PI: Pinsky    Pinsky plans to study pointwise
              Fourier inversion in rank-one symmetric spaces of the compact and  non-compact
              type. At the same time he plans to continue the wave-equation approach to
              Fourier inversion, with special emphasis on the connection between focusing
              phenomena and the speed of convergence of Fourier transforms in two and three
              dimensions.  He will also investigate Hermite polynomial expansions, which  are
              closely related to the Schrodinger equation for the quantum oscillator, in the
              same fashion that Fourier transforms are related  to the (d'Alembert) wave
              equation.     The subject of pointwise Fourier inversion has been a central
              concern in mathematical analysis for nearly a century.  In the case of one
              variable, Fourier analysis is essential to understanding filtering and sampling
              in signal processing and other time series  phenomena in electrical engineering
              and the applied sciences. In the case of several variables, Fourier analysis is
              closely related to solving the partial differential equations that occur in
              physics, geology, and mechanical engineering. A detailed study of Gibbs'
              phenomenon and related higher-dimensional examples of divergence and
              oscillation of Fourier partial sums will be made by the principal investigator.
              It will be interesting to contrast the results of this study with the currently
              popular "wavelet" transforms, which have found many applications in recent
              years.
