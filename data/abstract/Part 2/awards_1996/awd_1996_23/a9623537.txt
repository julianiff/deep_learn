Abstract    :
              9623537  Riley   Members of a bacterial family Rhizobiaceae are known for their
              nitrogen-fixing, symbiotic relationship with a variety of legume host plants. 
              The soil bacteria forms nodules on legume roots, where it fixes atmospheric
              nitrogen into a form which the plant can use.  The goal of this study is to
              test for coevolution between these two symbiotic partners.  Similarity of
              branching patterns in phylogenies (or, phylogenetic congruence) is strong
              evidence of a shared evolutionary history between symbionts, and will be used
              to test for coevolution between the Rhizobeaceae and their legume hosts.
              Research will determine whether genetic information enabling the bacteria to
              become a symbiont of the plant, the sym region, has coevolved with genes of the
              host plant during the process of host plant diversification.  Findings will
              also illustrate the contribution of geographic separation among spatially
              isolated strains to genetic divergence in rhizobia and show whether nodulation
              genes have been transferred between different rhizobial chromosomal lineages
              over the evolutionary history of rhizobia.   Understanding the evolution of
              associations between Rhizobiaceae and legumes is important agriculturally. 
              Legumes include the important crop plants, soybeans, peas, and chickpeas.  The
              nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with rhizobia has also been exploited as a way to
              replenish soil with fixed nitrogen without using chemical fertilizers. 
              Understanding how rhizobia/host relationships arose, the stability of the
              association throughout the diversification of legumes,  and the types of
              evolutionary pressures which maintain the symbiosis in nature is critical if
              crop production and soil fertility are to be improved by manipulating the
              symbiosis.
