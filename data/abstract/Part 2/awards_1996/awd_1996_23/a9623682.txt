              Ketterson    External  dynamic  probes with frequencies of the  order  of  the 
              energy  gap will be used to study the excitation spectrum of  the 
              unconventional superfluids Helium-3 and UPt3. The probes will  be  microwaves 
              and ultrasound for UPt3, and an oscillating  magnetic  field and ultrasound for
              Helium-3. The temperature dependence  of  the  microwave impedance of Upt3 will
              be studied using a recently  developed  variable-frequency, cryogenic,
              microwave spectrometer.  This will allow determination of the
              temperature-dependent energy  gap  and  will  enable  a  search for collective 
              modes  in  this  material.  Helium-3  shear  waves  and  their  interaction  
              with  collective  modes  will be investigated using a unique  variable- 
              path-length sound cell developed in this laboratory.  Finally,  a  search  will
              be performed for evidence of interaction between  an  oscillating magnetic
              field and various collective modes in Helium-  3.  %%%  Superconductivity   is 
               finding   on   increasing   number    of  applications,  including high-field
              magnets, sensitive  magnetic-  field  detectors and high-speed computers. Most 
              of  the  present  interest  surrounds  the high-temperature superconductors. 
              These  materials,   which   may   be  referred  to   as   unconventional 
              superconductors,  are  thought to derive  their  properties  from  mechanisms  
              that   differ  from  those  found  in   conventional  superconductors.  Two 
              other  classes  of  materials  also   show  unconventional  behavior: the rare
              isotope of  helium  (Helium-3)  and  a  uranium-platinum compound (UPt3). These
              materials are  of  unique  scientific interest as well as being testing grounds
               for  developing    an    understanding   of   other   non-conventional 
              superconductors (including the high-Tc materials).  This  project  will  employ
               high-frequency  probes,  including  microwaves  and  ultrasound, to study
              excitation phenomena in these mat erials  and  thence  derive an understanding
              of the unconventional  nature  of  their superconductivity and superfluidity
