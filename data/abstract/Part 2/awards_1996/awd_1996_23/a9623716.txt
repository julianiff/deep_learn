Abstract    :
              9623716  Bozler    This   project  is  an  investigation  of  three   different 
              materials at ultralow temperatures while developing advanced  dc SQUID
              amplifiers to support this work. The first study is  of  the  magnetic
              properties of superfluid 3He, focusing  on  the  discrepancy between SQUID and
              NMR measurements  of  the  static susceptibility. The second study is of thin
              films  of  3He   in   magnetic  fields  sufficiently   small   that   a 
              wo-dimensional  nuclear  ferromagnetic  transition  can   be  manifested.  In 
              these  magnetic  fields,  conventional  NMR  techniques  are unusable. Finally,
              electrical conduction  in  reduced  dimensionality systems will be  studied, 
              including  the   physics  of  disorder  in  artificial  two-dimensional 
              networks of effectively one-dimensional wires.  %%%  This   project   is  a 
              study  of  materials   at   ultralow  temperatures   combined   with,  and  
              supported   by,   the  development of ultralow temperature experimental
              techniques,  including  advanced  low-noise amplifiers.  At  temperatures  near
               1  mK  (0.001 degrees above Absolute  Zero)  the  rare  isotope  of helium
              (helium-3) changes to a superfluid  whose  magnetic  properties  are not yet 
              well  understood.   These  magnetic  properties will be studied in this 
              project.  Thin  films  of liquid helium-3 will also be studied because  they 
              have  proved to be an excellent model for magnetism  in  two  dimensions. 
              Artificial  one- and  two-dimensional  metallic  systems   will  be 
              manufactured  and  studied   to   better  understand the role of disorder in
              natural physical systems.  ***
