Abstract    :
              9623038  Griess    This grant supports the research of Professor R. Griess to
              work  on three different areas. The first area is that of embedding  finite
              simple groups into certain exceptional Lie groups. Next he  will study the
              automorphism groups of infinite dimensional vertex  operator algebras. Finally
              he hopes to come up with methods that  will give a more uniform method of
              generating the finite simple  groups through the study of automorphisms of
              certain lattices.     This is research in the field of algebra. Algebra can be
              thought  of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As such algebra has 
              direct applications to areas of physics and chemistry. In  particular the
              modern theory of gauge fields in physics uses this  area of algebra
              extensively. There are also connections to coding  theory and the transmission
              of data across communication lines.
