Abstract    :
              9623087  Caflisch    This proposal is for development of analytical and
              computational methods   for describing singularities in the solutions of
              partial differential equations   (PDEs), and for application of those methods
              to problems of fluid   mechanics and other physical systems. The key step in
              the analysis is    transformation of the variables of the PDE to obtain an
              "unfolded" system,   the solutions of which are non-singular. This will be used
              for vortex sheets,   swirling flow,  magnetohydrodynamics and crystal patterns.
               For these   problems we will attempt to find singular solutions and to
              classify their   generic type.    This proposal is for research on
              "singularities" in physics and engineering   problems.  Singularities are
              points at which the measurable quantities in the   system change abruptly or
              become very large.  An important example,   which is a main focus of this
              project is the development of very large   rotational velocity in a fluid such
              as air or liquid.  These singularities are   believed to be a primary cause of
              turbulence, an important but poorly  understood phenomena in many applications.
               The goals of this research   project are to find these singularities, classify
              their possible behavior and   use them to gain understanding of turbulence and
              other problems.
