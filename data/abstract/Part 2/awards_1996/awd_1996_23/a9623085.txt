Abstract    :
              Swanson  96-23085    This proposal supports the work of Professor I. Swanson to
              work  on problems in commutative algebra. She intends to study how, in 
              Noetherian rings of prime characteristic, primary deomposiiton  varies with
              Frobenius powers. She also hopes to develop  algorithms for calculating
              adjoints and cores when the ring is  not two dimensional.     This research is
              on the boundary between commutative algebra and  algebraic geometry. Both
              fields  arose from the classical problem  of studying mathematical objects
              defined in the plane by the  simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today,
              the fields use  methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and 
              topology, and conversely are extensively used in those fields.   Moreover it
              has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as  physics, theoretical computer
              science, cryptography, coding  theory and robotics.
