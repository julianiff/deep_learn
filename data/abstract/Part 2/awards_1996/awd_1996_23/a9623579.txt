Abstract    :
              9623579  Letzter    This award supports the research of Professor E. Letzter to
              work in non-commutative ring theory with special emphasis on problems arising
              from the theory of quantum groups. In particular, Professor Letzter will study
              prime and primitive ideals in finitely generated noncomutative Noetherian
              bialgebras, Hopf superalgebras, and iterated skew polynomial rings. He hopes to
              apply this work to studying multiparametric quantum function algebras in the
              root-of-unity case.     This is research in the subfield of algebra called
              non-commutative ring theory. Algebra can be thought of as the study of symmetry
              in the abstract. As such, algebra has direct applications to areas of physics
              and chemistry. In fact, much of non-commutative ring theory generalizes
              structures found in quantum mechanics and this proposal continues to explore
              areas that connect directly with modern quantum field theory.
