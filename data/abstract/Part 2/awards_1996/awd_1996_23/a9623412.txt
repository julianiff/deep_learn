Abstract    :
                  9623412  Schmid  A CAREER award supports research and education related to 
              manufacturing tribology.  In the research arena a two-phase  flow model will be
              developed and validated for  coolants/lubricants in metals deformation
              processes, such as  ironing.  The model is based on an application of the 
              Reynolds equation independently to the oil and the water  components of the
              two-phase emulsion and it then couples  them via identical pressure gradient
              and viscous interaction  terms.  In the educational arena the
              multi-disciplinary  approach to design for manufacturing will be emphasized.
