                 This  experimental research project in condensed  matter  physics  will 
              study  particle  dynamics  in  colloidal  suspensions   and  diffusing  photon
              dynamics in highly scattering or turbid  media.  These studies of colloids
              center around new ideas for the control  of colloidal particle motion.  In
              particular, traps and templates  for   particles  on  substrates  will  be 
              created  by  carefully  constructing free energy barriers. These free energy
              barriers are  brought  about as a result of entropy effects in the  suspension.
               Photon  transport investigations will center on  the  fundamental  properties
              of highly scattered light. In particular the  research  will   study  how 
              material  anisotropy,  and  fluctuations   are  impressed upon photon
              electromagnetic fields that diffuse through  turbid media in a manner similar
              to heat flow.  %%%  Careful  study  of light beams passing into highly
              scattering  or  turbid  materials has revealed a variety of interesting
              phenomena  and  applications. Light diffuses through these substances  in  a 
              manner  similar  to  heat  flow. As a  result  of  our  increased  knowledge
              about these processes diffusing light can now  be  used  to  generate  low
              resolution images of absorption  or  scattering  variations  within  human
              tissues and in  other  complex,  opaque  media.  One  goal  of  this proposal
              is to  develop  an  improved  fundamental  understanding  of these processes, 
              and  to  further  develop  the instrumentation required to exploit these
              phenomena,  so  that more diverse applications are possible. A secondary goal 
              of  this  proposal is to create new materials based  on  particle  suspension
              that may be of use in the topical field of photonics.  ***
