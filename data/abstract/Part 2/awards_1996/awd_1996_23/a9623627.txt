Abstract    :
                  9623627  Lauder    Natural  selection  is  believed  to  maintain  symmetry 
              in  vertebrate  jaws because any deviation from  symmetry  would  negatively 
              affect  the  ability to acquire  food.  Yet,  as  adults, flatfish have
              morphologically asymmetrical jaws  and  might  exhibit asymmetrical prey
              capture. This project  will  determine if and how functional asymmetry is
              produced in two  flatfish    species   using   high-speed   video   analysis, 
              morphological  description,  electromyography,  and   three-  dimensional
              modeling of jaw mechanisms. Preliminary  results  indicate  that  one  flatfish
              species produces  asymmetrical  gape  and bending of the jaws out of the
              midline during prey  capture.  However, another species does not  experience 
              jaw  bending  or  asymmetrical gape. This project will  focus  on  modifying 
              current two-dimensional models to produce  three-  dimensional  models which
              can accurately predict  functional  asymmetry.  Models generated will be used
              in the  future  to  predict  prey  capture  behavior  in  other  flatfishes 
              and  applied to symmetrical fishes to gain a better understanding  of  the
              three-dimensional nature of prey capture mechanisms.  This  project will add to
              our understanding of morphological  diversity,  and  related diversity in the
              capture  of  prey,  that can exist in an important group of organisms.
