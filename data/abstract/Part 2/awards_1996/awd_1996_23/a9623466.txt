Abstract    :
              9623466  Corbin    The effects of habitat destruction are a central concern for
              the conservation of natural communities and populations. One aspect of habitat
              destruction, fragmentation, is predicted to reduce the size of impacted
              populations, decrease the number of populations, and cause populations to
              become isolated from one another, genetically.  Together, these effects
              increase the probability of  local and regional extinction.  Work funded in
              this award will address the effects of habitat fragmentation on the population
              dynamics of the prairie beetle (Chrysochus auratus) a resident of prairie
              fragments in western Minnesota.  The tallgrass prairie ecosystem of the United
              States has experienced massive alteration.  In Minnesota, less than 0.1% of the
              original tallgrass prairie remains, mostly as small isolated preserves. The
              degree of population interaction and the overall pattern of movement of
              individuals among local populations and prairie fragments will be examined by
              genetically characterizing each local population.  In so doing, the
              connectedness of fragmented beetle populations can be ascertained.   These data
              will indicate the degree to which  local populations function as a single
              genetic and demographic unit, a primary conceptual issue in conservation
              biology.  Also, the relative importance of particular prairie remnants and
              local populations to the overall population structure among and within
              preserves will be examined. Documenting these patterns and the processes that
              underlie them is crucial for understanding the effects of habitat fragmentation
              and effective management of fragmented habitat.
