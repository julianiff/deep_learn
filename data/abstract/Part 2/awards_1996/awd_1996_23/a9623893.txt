Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9623893  Principal Investigator: Mark Lee      CAREER: 
              Application of a High Tc Superconductor for Large Bandwidth Far-Infrared Mixing
              Receivers    Superconductors have a uniquely sensitive and rapid quantum
              mechanical response to electromagnetic radiation near the gap frequency.  The
              new high Tc cuprate superconductors posses an effective gap at least ten times
              that of Nb  therefore allowing access to the higher frequency far-infrared
              regime, 1 to 10 THz, for the first time.  This is a region in which the
              electromagnetic frequencies are beyond the optical range for conventional
              receivers.  Also recent experiments show that the response bandwidth of the
              high Tc receivers can exceed 40 GHz, a ten-fold improvement of any existing
              technology. This will vastly increase the amount of information which can be
              carried in the THz band.  The physical principles governing the electrodynamics
              o these superconductors are still unsettled.  This work will simultaneously
              elucidate fundamental aspects of thigh Tc superconductivity while advancing
              practical detectors to fill this technological void he electromagnetic
              spectrum.
