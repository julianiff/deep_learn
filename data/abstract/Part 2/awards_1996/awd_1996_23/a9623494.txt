              Erskine    This  project investigates the electronic and magnetic properties 
              of  thin  film structures, surfaces, and interfaces using  recent  progress in
              materials synthesis, advanced structure determination  methods,    and   
              magnetically-sensitive   spectroscopic     and  microscopic  techniques. The
              principle scientific objectives  are  to  explore  the relationship between
              structure and magnetism  on  several  length  scales  and  to  probe  magnetic 
              phenomenon  in  artificially-stabilized phases of ultra-thin  films, 
              interfaces,  and  nanostructures. The experiments address  issues  of  current 
              theoretical   interest  including  the  notion  of  2-dimensional  scaling 
              universality classes and related scaling parameters.  It  is   relevant   to 
              recent  initiatives  aimed   at   a   broader  commercialization  of 
              Magneto-resistance  Random  Access  Memory  (MRAM) technology  %%%  The 
              fundamental  understanding of the  electronic  and  magnetic  properties  of
              thin film structures, surfaces, and interfaces  is  of  current  interest due
              to the recent initiatives  aimed  at  a  broader  commercialization  of
              Magneto-resistance  Random  Access  Memory (MRAM) technology. The project
              addresses issues of current  theoretical  interest  and  exploits new  advances
               in  materials  synthesis, novel structural determination methods, and 
              state-of-  the-art  magnetically  sensitive  techniques  to  probe  magnetic 
              phenomena   and   phase  transitions  in  artificially   produced  structures.
              The program is aimed at making major contributions to  the  local  scientific/
              technological infrastructure and  to  the  Center  for  Advanced 
              Microstructures  (CAMD)  at  Baton  Rouge,  Louisiana.  ***
