Abstract    :
              9623453  Martindale      This  research explores the molecular mechanisms behind
               the  evolution  of  form  in  segmented animals.   Many  animals,  including 
              vertebrates and arthropods, are  segmented.   The  polychaete  marine  annelids
              are an ideal  model  system  to  study   how   similar  segments  become 
              different   through  evolution  because  of  the  great  diversity  in 
              segmental  morphology between closely related species.    A   family   of 
              genes  known  to  control  these  segmental  differences  are  the homeobox, or
              Hox, genes.   This  study  will  compare the deployment of these genes in two
              different  species of polychaetes to look for evidence of changes  that  can 
              explain the evolution from a simple repeated series  of  segments  to  series
              of segments that vary within  the  same  animal.  Information on the way the
              Hox genes operate in the  polychaetes will add to our knowledge of how the Hox 
              genes,  and  their  regulation,  have  affected  the  evolution   of 
              developmental patterns within and between the  major  animal  groups.
