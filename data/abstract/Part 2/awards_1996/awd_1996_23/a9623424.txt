Abstract    :
              9623424  Rosenbaum  The CAREER award addresses the fundamental issues regarding
              Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) reliability of Integrated Circuits and Devices
              fabricated in SOI-CMOS technology.  Thermal modeling, design of  protection
              devices, and experimental testing form the basis of the investigation.  The
              device models and stress limits will be incorporated into a CAD tool for
              circuit level simulation.  The education of graduate students will be
              interdisciplinary and involve the development of a new course.  ***
