Abstract    :
              9623694  Reppy    Threee topics will be pursued which illustrate different 
              aspects of superfluid physics under conditions of disorder:  1. The superfluid
              transition of liquid helium in porous  (Vycor) glass, specifically a
              measurement of the heat  capacity anomaly at the transition - for which a major
               advance in the art of low-temperature calorimetry will be  required  2.
              Dissipative superflow in porous media. The system serves  as a boson analog of
              a high-Tc superconductor, in which the  understanding of the vortex fluid and
              the flux flow is of  technically important.  3. The superfluid phase found in
              the second layer of 4He  adsorbed on graphite - a unique phase that calls for
              further  investigation.  %%%  Superfluid helium is employed to illuminate
              problems of  general interest in condensed-matter physics. The effect of 
              impurities and structural defects on "critical phenomena"  and other properties
              will be examined. The study of liquid  helium contained in a porous medium,
              where the structure  acts as a "quenched impurity", can provide valuable
              insights  and tests for understanding the fundamental problem of  disorder in
              condensed-matter systems.  ***
