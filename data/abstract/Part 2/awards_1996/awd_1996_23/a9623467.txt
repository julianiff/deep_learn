Abstract    :
              9623467  Lange  The microstructural engineering approach involves control of 
              concrete microstructure through processing to yield specific  material
              properties.  The overall objective of the study is  to enhance understanding of
              the relationship between  concrete material properties and the physical reality
              of  microstructure and crack geometry.  The study applies state-  of-the-art
              techniques for material characterization,  mechanical testing, surface
              characterization and  visualization, computer modeling and analysis toward the 
              objective of learning more about how concrete microstructure  controls bulk
              material behavior.  The Education Plan  includes curriculum development and
              undergraduate research  support, and an outreach project to local high schools.
