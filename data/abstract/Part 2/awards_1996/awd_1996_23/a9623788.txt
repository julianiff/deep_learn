Abstract    :
              AST 9623788                                                            ABSTRACT 
                                              A two-channel infrared camera with a 1024 x
              1024 pixel  HgCdTe array will be constructed.  The camera will initially  be
              used for imaging at the 2.3 meter telescope of the  Steward Observatory.  In a
              second phase of the work, the  camera will be used at the 6.5 meter telescope,
              the  converted MMT, where it will take advantage of an adaptive  optical system
              on the telescope to provide a large field (~  40 arcsec) corrected to
              diffraction-limited resolution in  the JHK bands.  The resolution ranges from
              images of 0.032  arcsec FWHM at 1 micrometer wavelength (in the best seeing) 
              to routine high Strehl images of 0.16 arcsec at 5  micrometers.  Wavelengths
              above 2 micrometers will be  accessed with a second 1024 x 1024 array of InSb,
              to be  procured in the third year.  The cooled optics include a  dichroic
              beamsplitter to allow two color imaging in one  exposure.
