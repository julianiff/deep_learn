Abstract    :
              9623836  Rubenstein      Every  spring  approximately  2.4  billion  birds  from
               185  species  migrate   from their African wintering  grounds  to  breed  in
              the Palaearctic. The migrants are members  of  185  species and the majority
              are small insect eating passerines.  Long    distance   migration   in   small 
               passerines    is  physiologically intriguing because it combines elements from
               two disparate physiological states: fasting and high aerobic  exercise.   
              This  project  will  use  Old  World   warblers  (Sylviidae)  as  a model to
              study the fuel use  and  protein  conservation  of long-distance vernal
              migrating  passerines.  Short,  medium and long distance migrants (Sylvia spp) 
              will  be  captured mid-migration in Sede Boker, Israel.  Variation  in  fuels 
              used  in  flight and protein catabolism  will  be  correlated with the effects
              of energy reserves and migration  distance.  This  project  promises  to  add 
              new  levels  of  understanding  to exercise physiology, fasting  biology  and 
              migration   physiology   and   promises   to   broaden   our  understanding of
              how these processes can work in concert.
