Abstract    :
              9623796  Grosberg   When a mechanism evolves that prevents the exchange of genes
              between previously interbreeding populations, both populations gain the
              potential for independent evolutionary divergence.  This process, referred to
              as reproductive isolation or biological speciation, ensures the evolutionary
              independence of a population, providing an opportunity for further
              morphological, physiological, and behavioral divergence. In the research funded
              by this award a multidisciplinary research plan will be carried out to
              integrate data from mating studies, the fossil record, and a highly resolved
              DNA-based phylogeny of populations to analyze the evolution of reproductive
              isolation between two diverging species of predatory marine snails, Nucella
              emarginata 'northern' and N. emarginata 'southern'.  Findings will make
              possible an understanding of the process of speciation within one of the most
              common taxa of intertidal snails found on the rocky shores of western North
              America.   Ultimately, present patterns of biological diversity are directly
              influenced by the rate at which speciation occurs in nature.  Reconstructing
              the historical patterns of variation before, during, and after the evolution of
              reproductive isolation provides insight into the processes which drive the
              evolution of isolating mechanisms and the radiation of species.  Such knowledge
              can directly enhance efforts to conserve biodiversity in marine systems.
