Abstract    :
              REICH  DEB-9623458  White cedar forests were once common in the western Great
              Lakes region.  Widespread logging and fire in the early 20th century reduced
              old-growth white cedar forests to a few small stands surrounded by younger
              forest.  White cedar forests in upland areas, such as the North Shore of Lake
              Superior, are especially rare.  For several decades, white cedar reproduction
              in remaining patches has been scarce.  As older trees die, there are no younger
              trees to replace them. The North Shore White Cedar Restoration Project will
              identify the most serious problems faced by white cedar.  The proposed study
              will identify barriers to regeneration in old-growth cedar forests on the North
              Shore of Lake Superior and enable the development of a recovery plan for this
              rare plant community.  Factors leading to unsuccessful cedar reproduction may
              include browsing by white-tailed deer, poor growth conditions, and seed
              dispersal limitations.    If reproduction continues to be unsuccessful, these
              forests may disappear within our lifetime, and thus this represents a
              biodiversity concern at several levels.  The white cedar forest as an ecosystem
              type represents a part of our natural heritage; moreover, there may be plants
              and animals particularly associated with cedar forests whose distribution and
              abundance may be restricted due to the shrinkage of this habitat type.
