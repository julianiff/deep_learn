Abstract    :
              9623299  Warren    Impurity-species nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR)  will  be 
              used   to   investigate  the  local  atomic  and  electronic  structure  of
              impurities in crystalline semiconductors.  Our  previous  variable-temperature 
              studies  of  the  donor  and  acceptor bands in Si(P) and Si(B) in the range
              100 -  500  K  will  be extended to liquid helium temperatures.  The  group 
              III  impurities Ga and In in II-VI materials will be studied  by  conventional 
              impurity-nucleus NMR in  the  presence  of  persistent   photoconductivity  at 
              low  temperatures.    An  attempt will be made to observe optical nuclear
              polarization  in  ZnO  and related II-VI materials.  The effect of optical 
              excitation on the local atomic structure of impurities  such  as  Ga  in CdTe
              will be examined as a test of the "DX model"  of these materials.  %%% 
              Impurity  atoms  play  a  critical role  in  technologically  important 
              semiconducting crystals since they introduce  the  charged  carriers  necessary
              for the  materials  to  conduct  electricity.   Despite  their importance,  the
               atomic-scale  environments  of many important impurities are still  poorly 
              understood.   Nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR)  provides  a  highly  local,
              chemically-specific probe which will be  used  in   this   research  to 
              investigate  the  structural   and  electronic environments of selected
              impurities in  materials  such  as CdTe and Si.  The state of atoms such as Ga
              and  In  in  CdTe  and  related  materials  will  receive  particular 
              attention  in an attempt to understand why these impurities,  contrary   to  
              conventional  behavior,  do  not   introduce  carriers.   In Si, NMR will be
              used to clarify  the  way  in  which  interactions between P or B impurities
              influence  the  carrier mobility and hence, the performance of silicon-based 
              devices.  ***
