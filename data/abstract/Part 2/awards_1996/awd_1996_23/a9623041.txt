Abstract    :
              The investigator studies arithmetical group quotients of bounded Hermitian 
              domains of exceptional types  with the goal to find their geometric 
              interpretation as the moduli spaces  of some special Calabi-Yau manifolds. The
              cohomology of such varieties should carry additional special structures related
              to representation theory of Lie groups of exceptional type.       Calabi-Yau
              manifolds have recently become notorious because of their important role in
              physics. New ten dimensional models of the space-time proposed in the string
              theory contain a Calabi-Yau manifold as an additional part to the usual four
              dimensional space-time. The special Calabi-Yau manifolds sought by the
              investigator may appear as the right candidates for the choice of the  model of
              the space-time.
