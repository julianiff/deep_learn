Abstract    :
              Abstract  9623390   Li      The PI will develop further the method of moving
              planes and study   the following three problems: the  a priori estimates,
              classification, and   asymptotic analysis of solutions to some nonlinear
              differential equations;   the prescribed Gaussian (or scalar) curvature
              problem; and the existence,   uniqueness, and stability of travelling fronts.
              One focusing point of this   project is to classify singular solutions or
              sequences of blow-up solutions   in terms of when, where, how, and in what form
              do they occur. The method of   moving planes is the main tool to be developed
              and used for this and other   purposes. The analysis is particularly useful in
              the study of the last two   problems where the PI has already obtained some
              interesting results.    Many aspects of natural phenomena are related to each
              other by the natural   laws governing them and very often these laws are
              described by differential   equations. To understand these differential
              equations, it is necessary to   classify all possible singular solutions or
              sequences of blow-up solutions.   The PI proposes to study the prescribing
              curvature problem which involves   some very challenging nonlinear partial
              differential equations. In fact, this   type of equations also appear in many
              different fields of sciences. Also,   singular solutions or sequences of
              blow-up solutions are the major barriers   to the complete understanding of
              these equations. The PI will also study the   existence, uniqueness, and
              stability of travelling fronts which describe the   long term behavior of
              solutions to evolution type equations. He is mainly   interested in problems
              arising from population dynamics and from flame   propagation and ignition in
              combustion theory.
