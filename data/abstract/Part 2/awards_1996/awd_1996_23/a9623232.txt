Abstract    :
              This awards supports the research of Professor M. Stillman to  continue the
              development of Macaulay 2. This system will enable  large scale research
              computing projects dealing with systems of  polynomial equations in many
              variables. He also hopes to work on  the relationship of syzygies of a
              projective variety to the  geometry of the variety.     This research is in the
              field of algebraic geometry, one of the  oldest parts of modern mathematics,
              but one which blossomed to  the point where it has, in the past 10 years,
              solved problems  that have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures 
              defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely  polynomials. Today,
              the field uses methods not only from algebra,  but also from analysis and
              topology, and conversely it is  extensively used in those fields.  Moreover it
              has proved itself  useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer
               science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.  The software  being
              developed here will make many previously difficult or  impossible computations
              in this field possible.
