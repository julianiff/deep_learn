Abstract    :
              9623574  Venable   Research funded by this award explores the evolutionary
              importance of variation in the timing of resource availability for desert
              plants. A prominent feature of desert ecosystems is extreme variability in
              moisture and temperature within and among years.  The focus of this study is on
              annual plants that complete their life cycle in less than one year.  The study
              system, Plantago insularis, is an important food source for herbivores and
              granivores in Sonoran and Mohave Desert communities. The annual life history
              promotes the avoidance of intervals of low resource availability  via seed
              dormancy. For this strategy to be successful, the timing of seed germination
              and seed production must be synchronized with  yearly weather patterns.  Using
              a combination of field and greenhouse experiments,  the research will test the
              genetic basis of variation in germination and flowering times and ascertain the
              fitness consequences of these characters.    Findings will allow tests of
              theory on plant adaptations to variable environments.  In addition,
              environmental and genetic aspects of the correlation between two
              developmentally linked traits, germination time and flowering time, will be
              resolved.  One application of this knowledge is in the selection and breeding
              of annual crop species for earlier flowering times.
