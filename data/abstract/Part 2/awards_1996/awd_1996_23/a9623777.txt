Abstract    :
                  9623777  Richardson    The theme of the proposed work is to examine the
              consequences of  the very large amplitude quantum motion in solid helium. The 
              first objective is to observe and measure the rates of exchange  of 3He atoms
              in three, four, and six particle rings. According to  theory, the ring-like
              exchange motion is responsible for the  unique nuclear magnetic ordering in
              solid 3He. The ring exchange  motion has never been directly observed. Special
              nmr techniques  will have to be developed for the observation. A further 
              objective of the work is an attempt to see new modes of atomic  motion by using
              Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Several unusual and  important phenomena have been
              predicted but have never been  observed.  %%%  The researchers will use nuclear
              magnetic resonance techniques to  study a remarkably interesting material,
              solid helium. Because  helium has such a very light mass, its atomic motion is
              quite  large even near absolute zero temperature. Modern magnetic  resonance
              techniques will be used to study the nature and  consequences of that motion.
              For example, the zero temperature  state of solid helium has been predicted to
              have the atoms moving  rapidly in ring like rotations, rather than sitting
              quietly at  fixed crystalline lattice points.  ***
