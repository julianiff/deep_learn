Abstract    :
              9623949  Schultz    This   project  will  focus  on  the  development   of  
              advanced  instrumentation  in two areas. In the first, we  will  utilize  a 
              50nm  plasmon  resonant  particle as the  optical  transducer  to  achieve  
              scanning  near-field  microscopy  in  the  fluorescent,  luminescent, and Raman
              modes. We expect this development to  have  significant  applications  in  the 
              electronics,  chemical,   and  bio-medical  research and industrial
              communities. In  the  second  area,  we  will  apply  the  most  sensitive 
              technique  for  the  efficient  detection of superconductivity to a systematic 
              search  for new high Tc alloys using phase spread samples.    %%%    This  
              project  will  focus  on  the  development   of   advanced  instrumentation 
              for  commercial  application  in  two  important  areas.  The first is a new
              type of optical microscope which  will  offer  a  breakthrough in resolution
              and sensitivity of detection  for  many  bio-medical tests and research needs.
              The second  will  utilize  the  most  sensitive and economical screening 
              procedure  which we have developed for the discovery of new high temperature 
              superconductors. Rapid technology transfer in both areas  can  be  expected via
              subsequent cooperative SBIR projects.  ***
