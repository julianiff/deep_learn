Abstract    :
              9623405  Avramov    This award supports the research of Professor L. Avramov to
              work in commutative ring theory with special emphasis on problems arising from
              the interplay between structure homomorphisms and free resolutions of modules.
              He intends to study complete intersections as well as regularity properties of
              these homomorphisms. He will also study properties of Hochschild and
              Andre-Quillen homology.     This is research in the subfield of algebra called
              commutative ring theory. Algebra can be thought of as the study of symmetry in
              the abstract. As such, algebra has direct applications to areas of physics and
              chemistry. Moreover much of commutative ring theory is designed to generalize
              structures found in the solutions of equations. As such it has direct
              connections to such diverse 0areas as robotics and coding theory.
