Abstract    :
                          This project focuses on designing and analyzing fast approximation
              algorithms for  NP-hard problems, with good performance guarantees.  Despite
              the recent strong  results on the hardness of approximations, the PI and his
              Ph.D. Student have been  instrumental in introducing new methodologies for
              designing and analyzing  approximation algorithms, and in improving the best
              known performance guarantees  for a wide range of problems.  In particular, the
              goals of this project include:  (1) Development and refinement of methodologies
              to design and analyze  approximation algorithms;  (2) The deviation of
              approximation algorithms with  improved performance guarantees for a variety of
              combinatorial problems;(3)The  actual solution of important practical problems,
              arising in electrical  engineering and computer science, in computational
              molecular biology, and in  material science.  The Integrated Educational Plan
              of this CAREER Grant includes:  (1) Involvement of undergraduates in developing
              efficient software codes based on  approximation algorithms; (2) Development of
              undergraduate and graduate course  which address the changing job markets; (3)
              Development of a multimedia textbook  on optimization algorithms.***
