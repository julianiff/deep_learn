Abstract    :
              9623282  Alperin    This grant supports the research of Professor R. Alperin to
              work  on problems in the representation of finite groups on various  geometric
              objects. In particular he wants to work on groups  acting on trees, buildings
              and their generalizations. He hopes to  use various fixed point properties as
              an aid in classifying  certain groups with various homological or geometrical 
              realizations.     This is research in the field of group theory. Group theory
              can  be thought of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As such,  this
              area has direct applications to many areas of physics and  chemistry. Moreover,
              within the last 30 years, many connections  to problems in data transmission
              have been solved using  techniques from group theory. There are also direct
              connections  to the error correcting codes that are vital for modern computing 
              such as working with CD-ROM's.
