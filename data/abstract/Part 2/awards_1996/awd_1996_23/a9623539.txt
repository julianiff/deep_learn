Abstract    :
                  9623539  Farrell     The award continues support for research aimed at
              developing a general stability theory for atmospheric  flows as well as a
              theory for the dynamics of turbulence in strongly sheared flows  such as the
              midlatitude jet.  The principal investigator will pursue these goals using a
              combination of theoretical models and analysis of  simulations with a general
              circulation model (GCM).     The project involves two major thrusts.  The first
              builds on theoretical work completed under the last award.  The aim is to
              determine the variance and fluxes maintained by stochastic forcing of a GCM
              with realistic zonally varying jet structure and to compare these variances and
              fluxes with those obtained from the statistical means of a long time
              integration of the GCM.  A version of NCAR's Community Climate Model (CCM2)
              will be used.  It is hoped that this study will shed light on the dynamics
              responsible for producing localization of storms in particular regions and the
              sensitivity of storm tracks to alteration.   The project will be done in
              collaboration with an NCAR scientist.  The second research focus involves a
              more theoretically focused and generalized study of the underlying operator in
              turbulent model systems and GCMs and its stability properties.  An additional
              topic will be undertaken if time permits.  This study will examine the
              stability of time dependent flows - specifically, the relationship between
              transient growth of perturbations to the time mean flow and the emergence of
              the first Lyapunov mode and the role of non-normality in supporting both the
              short time error growth and the asymptotic Lyapunov modes.    ***
