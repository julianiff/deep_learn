Abstract    :
              This is a Faculty Early Career project. In research, the work will study  
              ditryptophan crosslinking units within proteins.  The ditryptophans are  
              highly fluorescent and easily detected for that reason.  The fluorescence  
              will be studied in model systems with constrained geometries.    Combinatorial
              chemistry will be used to optimize the ditryptophan   chromophore formation. 
              The work will determine the structural   consequences of tryptophan
              dimerization within peptides.  Hen egg white   lysozyme will be used as a
              substrate and the work will demonstrate that   fluorescence of ditryptophan
              units can be coupled to antibody binding.    In education, Dr. VanVranken will
              develop a graduate class which applies   advanced concepts in organic chemistry
              to biology, will organize a   seminar at the biology/chemistry interface, and
              will mentor students from   small colleges and minority students in research.  
              This project will develop a light-initiated technique for stabilizing the  
              structure of proteins.  A fluorescent probe will result and it will be   used
              to study biological events.  The project will develop educational   activities
              at the chemistry/biology interface and will involve mentoring   minority
              students and students from small colleges.
