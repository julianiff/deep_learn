Abstract    :
              9623811  Makris  Semi-active dampers are receiving considerable attention for 
              seismic protection applications, including such devices  ranging from hydraulic
              dampers to electrorheological (ER)  fluid dampers.  The implementation of
              semi-active dampers in  real structures is challenged by a number of
              fundamental  research problems such as:a) Salability b) The required  dynamic
              range c) Control models and algorithms; d) Viscous  heating and temperature
              dependent effects.  In this project  a systematic effort is made to investigate
              the forementioned  issues is proposed. Specifically:  The hysteretic unique 
              property of electrorheological dampers to develop a  combination of hysteric
              and viscous forces will be further  exploited to develop a practical solution
              to protection of  structures from earthquakes.  The entire project is based on 
              a coordinated interdisciplinary effort with strong  industrial support and
              collaboration.   A comprehensive  education program will move forward together
              with the  research project to involve students in their class work,  laboratory
              testings, and analytical investigations.  This is  a FY96 Career award.  ***
