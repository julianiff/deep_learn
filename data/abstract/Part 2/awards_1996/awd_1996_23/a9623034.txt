Abstract    :
                Abstract    IBN 96-23034  Markow and Bertram    Role of Selection in
              Maintaining Variation in Mate  Communication         Mate communication signals
              should exhibit minimal  variation because they function in species recognition.
               However, intra-specific variation in mating signals is  common.  This
              variation is proposed to result from opposing  sexual and natural selection,
              but few systems are amenable  to direct tests of this hypothesis.  The specific
              aim of the  proposed research is to determine if selective forces shape 
              observed signal variation in a field cricket.  Calling  behavior in Gryllus
              integer is sexually selected, but  appears to be subject to natural selection
              by acoustically  orienting parasitoids.  To accomplish the specific goal, 
              research will first determine the extent of within-male  variation in calling
              behavior, and whether males  facultatively adjust their calling behavior when
              exposed to  parisitoids.  Selection experiments will then determine how 
              natural and sexual selection influence inter-male variation  in calling
              behavior over several generations.  The proposed  research will be the first
              experimental test of the  hypothesis that conflicting selection forces shape
              mating  signals within a population.
