Abstract    :
              This research project is to investigate adaptive and nonlinear  methods for the
              solution of certain large and often ill-posed  inverse problems, where the
              solution may not depend continuously  on the data. The particular applications
              addressed concern large  scale adaptive filtering computations, such as in
              active noise  control, and nonlinear and adaptive image enhancement 
              computations.  The project is using a 400 node IBM SP2 at the  Maui High
              Performance Computing Center. This particular facility  specializes in image
              and signal processing applications.    The project includes the following
              topics:    - Fast and stable adaptive algorithms for  estimation and 
              filtering, along with sensitivity analysis, with applications in  signal
              processing.    - Nonlinear and adaptive image enhancement methods, including 
              Total Variation minimization involving partial differential  equations,
              adaptive multi-level segmentation-based methods, and a  combination of these
              two approaches.    - Coupling numeric and symbolic computations.    -
              Parallelization of the algorithms.    The project has strong educational and
              REU research components,  and includes participation by underrepresented
              minorities.
