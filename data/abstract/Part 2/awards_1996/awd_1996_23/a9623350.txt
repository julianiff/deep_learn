Abstract    :
              9623350  Stratton    Plant breeding systems act as filters on the quantity and
              quality of individual reproduction and influence population genetic structure,
              demography, and ecology.  In turn, both ecological factors and genetic
              interactions shape the evolution of plant breeding systems.  Previous analyses
              of plant mating system evolution have concentrated on the role of genetic
              factors and little is known about the role of pollination ecology in mating
              system evolution. This project fills that gap with experimental comparisons of
              the reproductive success of selfing and outcrossing plants.  Using the
              polymorphic granite outcrop endemic Arenaria uniflora as a model system, three
              integrated experiments will be conducted.  First the analysis of inbreeding
              depression in selfing and outcrossing individuals will indicate forces opposing
              the spread of self-fertile genotypes. Second, paternity analysis using marker
              alleles will measure the loss of male reproductive success associated with
              selfing.  Third, the value of automatic selfing in conferring reproductive
              assurance under conditions of pollinator scarcity will be tested
              experimentally.    Findings will provide an integrated analysis of the costs
              and benefits of each mating strategy under different ecological conditions. 
              This information will be of value in predicting population responses to changes
              in pollinator abundances under habitat fragmentation or other forms of
              environmental degradation.
