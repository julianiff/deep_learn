Abstract    :
              9623327  Soibelman    This grant supports the research of Professor Y. Soibelman
              to work on various problems in the theory of Kac-Moody groups. In particular he
              will study problems arising from the tensor structures in the theory of quantum
              affine algebras and compound versions of Lie bialgebras. He then will apply
              these results to quantum tau functions and quantum Weyl functions. Finally, he
              wishes to study chiral problems in the theory of quantum groups.     This is
              research that starts out in the field of algebra but moves beyond that to touch
              both number theory and theoretical physics.  The reasons for these connections
              are that algebra can be though of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As
              such algebra has direct applications to areas of physics and chemistry. In
              particular the modern theory of gauge fields in physics uses this area of
              algebra extensively and this project will study some of these connections at
              length. There are also connections to coding theory and the transmission of
              data across communication lines.
