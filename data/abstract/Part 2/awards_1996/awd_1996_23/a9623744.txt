Abstract    :
                9623744  Slamovich    Many applications will benefit from low temperature (< 
              100(C) processing routes to ceramic materials.  For example,  dielectric
              ceramics may be incorporated into  microelectronics manufacturing processes
              without degrading  metallizations, and ceramics may be coprocessed with 
              polymers for high strength capacitors or abrasion resistant  coatings. 
              Hydrothermal processing is a route to ceramics  below 100(C, involving the
              formation of crystalline material  from reactants in an aqueous medium.  This
              proposal is for  an initial four year period to investigate novel approaches 
              to processing ceramic and polymer/ceramic thin films based  on low temperature
              hydrothermal processing.  The research  effort seeks to develop routes to
              control film morphology  via an understanding of hydrothermal growth
              mechanisms.  Hydrothermal processing will also be used to fabricate 
              polymer/ceramic composite films.  %%%  Career education goals are centered
              around implementing  Purdue's new NSF sponsored materials processing
              curriculum.  The goal of this Career Development Plan is to develop new  routes
              towards integrated materials processing,  complementing the educational
              objectives of Purdue's new  Materials Science and Engineering curriculum.  ***
