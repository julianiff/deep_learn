Abstract    :
              9623928  Morris  Patchy and ephemeral resources such as rotting fruit are used
              by many species.  Individuals that live in the same patch often compete very
              strongly, yet competitors may coexist regionally.  Insects that live in rotting
              fruit frequently have highly aggregated intraspecific distributions, which may
              prevent competitive exclusion and maintain high species diversity.  An
              aggregated distribution increases the frequency of intraspecific competition
              and leaves empty patches that may be colonized by other species.  However the
              effect of aggregation has not been tested in the field, and may be swamped by
              other mechanisms.  Pilot studies have found many species of insects with larvae
              that live in the rotting fruit of the tree Apeiba membranacae, and have
              aggregated distributions.  These insects can be aggregated at three nested
              spatial scales:  individual fruit, whole trees, and forest fragments.  This
              research will experimentally test the importance of aggregation for coexistence
              in this system by documenting spatial patterns, measuring the strength and
              structure of competition, manipulating distributions of larvae, and
              investigating the interaction between predation and aggregation.  This research
              will provide one of the first field tests of the importance of aggregation in
              promoting species coexistence in patchy and ephemeral resources.  This research
              will also extend the existing theoretical models of coexistence due to
              aggregation to include multiple spatial scales.
