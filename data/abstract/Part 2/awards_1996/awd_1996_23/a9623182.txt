Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT    Sherman & Andrade  IBN 96-23182    An Investigation of Selection
              for Male Sacrifice Behavior         Males of many arthropod species contribute
              nutrients to  their mates during courtship or copulation ( nuptial  feeding ). 
              Such cases, particularly among the insects and  spiders, are interesting
              because they represent deviations  from the more typical mating pattern of male
              polygyny with  little material investment.  The functional significance and 
              ecological conditions controlling increased male investment  in insects has
              been a topic of interest for behavioral  ecologists and evolutionary
              biologists.  The proposed  project will increase understanding of mating
              systems where  males provide nuptial gifts by determining the conditions  under
              which the most extreme type of male nuptial feeding --  male copulatory
              suicide--can be selected.  This project is a  comparative study of two
              congeneric spider species  (Latrodectus hasselti and L. geometricus) in which
              males  appear to sacrifice themselves to females during copulation.  Field
              observations of daily movements, courtship behavior  and mating success will be
              combined with staged laboratory  interactions and estimations of reproductive
              output to  characterize the mating system, selective pressures, and 
              demographic characteristics of these two species.  Information gathered from
              this species will be used to  produce a model for the selection of male
              copulatory suicide  that will place the behavior within the existing framework 
              of sexual selection theory.
