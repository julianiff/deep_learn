Abstract    :
              9623971 Mukhopadhyay  Distributed information-sharing computer networks and
              automotive systems are two examples of an increasing number of applications
              areas in engineering and computing systems which require collaborative
              interaction between physically distributed decision-makers and controllers. 
              Such distributed applications frequently give rise to nonlinear distributed
              decision and control problems in the presence of uncertainties such as the
              effects of the local decisions on the over-all objective and incomplete system
              state information.  Artificial neural networks in the past have proven
              effective in adaptive realization of nonlinear decision-making and control
              rules.  In order to apply them to distributes applications, new interconnection
              models as well as  adaptation and learning methods are needed to cope with
              distributed sources of uncertainty such as those mentioned above.  Utilizing
              results form large-scale systems theory and current research on multiple 
              neural networks, the proposed research will investigate several closely-related
              distributed interconnection models of neural networks.  Constructive methods
              will be found to determine local approximations to an overall performance
              function under different conditions on the completeness of local measurements. 
              These local performance functions,  in turn, will yield adaptive methods for
              realization of nonlinear decision and control rules using  neural networks. 
              The model and methods derived will be applied to problems in the application
              areas of information sharing over computer networks and automotive control.
