Abstract    :
              The proposed research is directed towards the advancement of the  exploration of
              complex multi-dimensional timing control for  multimedia streams in distributed
              multimedia systems.  To achieve  this goal, this research effort focuses on the
              exploration and  development of a true generic system for the advanced timing 
              control of resources used by multimedia streams.  Timing control  is
              particularly important for interactive multimedia distributed  applications
              such as telerobotics, teleoperation in  manufacturing, and virtual reality
              applications with force  feedback including telesurgical training and
              audio-video  conferencing.    The focus of this research is on the study of 
              algorithms and  techniques to provide distributed control of multi-dimensional 
              timing behaviors over different resources in an integrated  fashion.  While
              there have been advances in the  control of the  one dimensional case (timely
              delivery), and of the  two-  dimensional case (media synchronization), there
              has been  little improvement in providing a third dimension in which the 
              systems can control the adaptation of timely delivery and/or  media
              synchronization specified by quality of service (QoS)  parameters such as
              end-to-end delay and jitter.    This research addresses integrated time-variant
              QoS management  for the above defined three dimensions.  To achieve this 
              integration, the research effort calls for: development of  concepts for
              time-variant QoS management; development of a  theoretical framework for formal
              specifications for time-variant  QoS and the modeling of distributed control to
              accommodate QoS  requirements; provision of an experimental testbed for
              multimedia  transmission according to QoS requirements; and, evaluation of  the
              framework through an experimental verification.  ***
