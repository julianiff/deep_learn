Abstract    :
              96223011  Guralnick    This award supports the research of Professor R.
              Guralnick to work in many diverse areas of algebra. He will be particularly
              concerned with connecting primitive permutation groups to other questions in
              algebra, geometry and number theory including problems of polynomials over
              finite fields. He will also study questions of how to generate finite simple
              groups and the eigenvalues of symmetric matrices over commutative rings.    
              This is research in the subfield of algebra called group theory.  Group theory
              can be though of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As such, it has
              direct applications to areas of physics and chemistry. Much of group theory
              also connects directly to problems in coding theory and so has a direct bearing
              on the very practical problem of error correcting in data transfer.
