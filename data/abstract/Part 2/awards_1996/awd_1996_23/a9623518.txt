Abstract    :
              Abstract  Shubin    The research will be concerned with problems from
              mathematical physics.  Several of the proposed problems center around the
              spectral theory of   random Schrodinger operators on trees or graphs or in the
              continuum.   A problem from the study of integral equations which has
              applications   to models from physics is also discussed.     Some of the
              problems to be investigated arise from the field of   solid state physics. To
              form a rough idea, start by imagining the motion   of a particle such as an
              electron in a crystal with a perfectly regular   structure. It is well-known
              that an electron, with a certain energy (in a   band), will travel through the
              crystal. In other words, the crystal acts as   a conductor. Consider a crystal
              with impurities. Such a system is called   disordered. Will this disordered
              crystal also act as a conductor? In   order to begin to answer this question, a
              precise definition of disorder   needs to be given. However many types of
              disordered crystals are not   conductors; rather they are insulators. Since the
              seminal work of Nobel   Prize winner P. Anderson, disordered systems have been
              the object of   intense mathematical investigations. Although many questions
              have been   answered in the past forty years, many more problems remain open. 
              In particular, disordered systems with space dimension greater than one,   are
              not well understood.
