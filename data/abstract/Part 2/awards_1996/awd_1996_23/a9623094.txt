Abstract    :
              9623094  Firestone  Microbial taxonomic and functional diversity may have the
              potential to determine the rate and dominance of different carbon stabilization
              pathways. In this research the PI's propose to achieve three objectives, each
              addressing the central question: do microbial communities vary in their ability
              to determine the fate of carbon in soil? To accomplish these goals, the PI's
              will assess microbial functional and taxonomic diversity, investigate community
              control over carbon partitioning, and will quantify the contribution of
              microbial cell walls to stable carbon. The PI's hope to involve aspects of
              humus chemistry, soil microbiology and ecosystem ecology in advancing our
              understanding of the role that microorganisms and microbial diversity play in
              ecosystem functioning. Ultimately, this work may have implications for regional
              carbon cycle models, and for predicting response of soil carbon pools to
              environmental and land-use change.  ??
