Abstract    :
                      This project focuses on expanding the capabilities of the  present (DNA)
              sequence analysis algorithms with respect to  comparing sequences and detecting
              features.  In particular,  the project concentrates on:(1) developing methods
              for  quantifying the relatedness of biological sequences under a  broader model
              of mutational events, than the currently used  substitution-indel model, and
              (2) improving methods for  detecting tandem repeats in sequences. The
              Integrated  Educational Plan of this CAREER Grant includes(a)developing  a
              curriculum for graduate study in computational and  mathematical biology, (b)
              developing courses and course  materials, including lecture notes, exercises,
              programming  projects and extensive bibliographies, that cover  combinatorial
              and algorithmic topics in sequence alignment,  DNA sequencing, DNA physical
              mapping, DNA physical mapping,  and prediction of protein folding and RNA
              folding, and  phylogenetic tree construction, (c) instituting a summer 
              training course for new researchers in computational  biology.***
