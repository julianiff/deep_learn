Abstract    :
              The project is to pursue ongoing investigations into core areas  of
              computational geometry, in particular, cell decomposition,  mesh generation,
              multidimensional searching, and geometric  optimization.  The research will
              span the spectrum from the  theoretical (e.g., lower bounds, geometric sampling
              techniques,  derandomization) to the practical (implementation and 
              distribution of geometric software).  Progress in the field has  been hampered
              by the difficulty in testing out new geometric  ideas on a computer.  As a
              result, experimentation has often  taken a backseat to theoretical research. 
              Essential to this  project is the building of software tools (e.g., algorithm 
              animation, visual debugging, test data generation) that  facilitate and
              encourage the use of experimentation.  ***
