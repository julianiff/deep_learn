Abstract    :
              962359  Abstract    Self-incompatibility (SI) loci have become  model systems
              for studying the role of selection in maintaining genetic diversity.  SI is a
              genetic system which prevents inbreeding in many plant species.  Research
              funded by this award will advance knowledge on the genetics of self-
              incompatibility  through examination of how these systems are organized at
              molecular, phenotypic and, populational levels. The relationship of molecular
              variation to the expression of incompatibility types will be determined through
              controlled breeding experiments.  These relationships will provide invaluable
              information linking complex phenotypes to DNA sequence variation, increasing
              our knowledge of how complex biological mechanisms are coded in the DNA. 
              Findings from several wild populations will be integrated analytically to
              understand the origins and distribution of genetic diversity within the
              species. This work will be accomplished using the wild tomato species,
              Lycopersicon chilense.  Lycopersicon chilense represents a close relative to
              domesticated tomatoes and  a valuable source of potential germplasm for this
              important crop.  Genes identified in this research could be of direct utility
              in manipulating the breeding system and pollination mechanism of domestic
              tomatoes.
