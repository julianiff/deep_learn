Abstract    :
              Abstract  Catlin    Catlin will investigate two problems.  For the first problem
              assume that P is a smooth real differential operator of order two such that at
              each point the principal symbol is semi-definite, although the sign of the
              symbol is allowed to change from point to point.  One can say that P is of
              finite type if a related system of first order operators is elliptic.  Under
              these hypotheses, Catlin wants to prove that P is hypoelliptic.  For the second
              problem, assume that M is a smooth strictly pseudoconvex CR manifold of
              dimension 2n-1 with n greater than 3.  Then M can be embedded in n-dimensional
              complex Euclidean space.  Catlin will study a family of norms in which the
              estimates for the Cauchy-Riemann equations are "elliptic" in order to prove a
              "sharp" embedding theorem.    Many physical phenomena such as vibrations or
              heat flow in an object can be expressed in terms of solutions of partial
              differential equations.  The behavior of these solutions can often be deduced
              by examining the coefficients of the equations.  This proposal is devoted to a
              study of how the solution changes when certain coefficients change from
              positive to negative, and also whether the coefficients are irregular.  Such
              equations may be relevant for physical processes in which either the nature of
              the problem is qualitatively different as one passes from one region to
              another, or in which the object being modeled has an irregular shape.
