Abstract    :

              Research Infrastructure:  Research Infrastructure for Parallel and Distributed
              Systems:  Real-Time, Multimedia and High-Performance        This award is for
              the acquisition of computing and communications resources to support the two
              primary research thrust of the Computer Science Department's experimental
              scientists.  The disciplines of both high performance computing and digital
              multimedia are characterized by their need for distributed computing nodes
              connected by high-bandwidth interconnections.  For high performance computing,
              distributed architectures are necessary to achieve sufficient price/performance
              when constructing gigaflops-capable machines.  In addition, high-bandwidth
              interconnects provide the necessary data distribution paths to supply each
              processor with work.  For digital multimedia, distributed systems allow
              multiple simultaneous users, and high-bandwidth interconnects are needed to
              supply the demands of multiple video and audio streams per user.  The equipment
              will also enable Boston researchers to apply advances in high performance
              computing to multimedia, medical imaging research and their three WWW related
              projects, capitalizing on the unique collective strength of the department.
