Abstract    :
              This project will explore issues in designing and implementing a coordination
              language for multidisciplinary applications.  Multidisciplinary applications
              are becoming increasingly popular among computational scientists, due to their
              ability to accurately model complex systems involving a variety of multiple
              disciplines.  For example, realistic aircraft modeling is achieved only by
              coordinating models from different disciplines, such as aerodynamics,
              propulsion, and structures.  While data parallel languages, such as High
              Performance Fortran, can be successfully applied to many numerical
              applications, they are ill-equipped to specify and manage the complex
              coordination required by multidisciplinary applications.  Since they lack
              "Programming-in-the-large" features, most current multidisciplinary
              applications are executed in a disjoint fashion with file I/O providing the
              necessary "plumbing" between the various segments of the application.  This
              project will develop an alternative, language-based approach that concentrates
              on the coordination of the various discipline codes, resulting in a clean and
              efficient execution model that supports multiple levels of parallelism.
