Abstract    :
                9623590  Fain      Ice  is important in a number of environments on the earth,
               in  the  atmosphere, on other planets, and in space.   The  objective  of 
              this  project  is to understand the interaction  between  ice  surfaces  and 
              other  solids  in  a  controlled  environment   at  temperatures near the
              triple point. Dynamical measurements of the  normal  and lateral forces exerted
              on scanning mechanical  probes  by  the surface of ice will be made as a
              function of temperature,  atmosphere above the ice surface, and electric
              potential  between  the  probe  and the ice. The fundamental information
              obtained  by  such  microscopic  scale measurements will aid  in  understanding
               macroscopic  mechanical  interactions between  ice  surfaces  and  other
              solids.      %%%    Ice is important in a number of environments on the earth,
              in the  atmosphere, on other planets, and in space. The objective of this 
              project  is to learn what happens when an ice surface comes  into  contact  
              with   a  microscopic  solid  probe  in  a   controlled  environment  at 
              temperatures near the triple  point.  The  probe  could  be  a  very  sharp
              point or a very small diameter  sphere;  forces  exerted  on the probe as it
              comes into contact  with  the  surface  will  be  measured by deflecting a 
              laser  beam  from  a  microscopic lever. The fundamental information obtained 
              by  such  measurements will aid in understanding large scale forces between 
              ice  surfaces and other solids such as occur in the  adhesion  of  ice to
              obiects in a cold environment.  ***
