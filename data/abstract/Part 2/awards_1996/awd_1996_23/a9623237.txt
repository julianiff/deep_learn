Abstract    :
              A methodology is to be developed which allows designers to do reliability 
              prediction and reliability budgeting using a high-level functional description 
              of the design.  Prediction models at the gate and function level will be 
              developed and verified using observed data.  Under reliability budgeting a 
              specified failure rate, or mean-time-to-failure, for the whole chip may be 
              partitioned to provide reliability targets for smaller pieces and thus lower 
              levels of abstraction.  The work leads to the development of a new course in 
              "Reliability Engineering for Integrated Circuits", which will provide a
              software  environment where ICs may be subjected to stress test experiments in
              virtual  environment at various design stages using observational data.
