Abstract    :
              Dr. Madnia's proposed research involves the use of numerical methods for
              nonpremixed turbulent combustion.  His research plan involves the study of
              turbulent combustion using (1) Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) with 
              affordable chemistry  (reduced chemistry) in order to obtain flame structure
              and concepts, and (2) Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of chemically reacting flows
              using Lagrangian Monte Carlo methods for the solution to the subgrid transport
              equations.  Flame structure and extinction will be investigated and compared to
              experiments.  Methane flames with reduced chemistry using DNS will be studied
              in order to assess the flamlet and distributed flame models.  The PI also
              intends to pursue several exploratory ideas for numerical models of plasma
              thick film processes, pulsatile flows for bioengineering, and CVD techniques. 
              He intends to write an undergraduate textbook on CFD, develop interactive basic
              fluid videos, perform outreach in high schools and industry and involve
              undergraduates in research.
