Abstract    :
                This project will undertake analysis of data to increase our  understanding of
              the possible signatures of magnetopause and  magnetospheric boundary layer
              processes that are observed in the  ionosphere and on the ground.  The study
              will focus specifically on  a search for simultaneous observations of two
              different geomagnetic  perturbation phenomena whose possible sources may be
              either the  magnetopause or the upstream solar wind.  The phenomena that will 
              be studied are Pc 3 micropulsations and high latitude magnetic  impulse events
              known as traveling convection vortices (TCVs).  Pc  3 micropulsations are
              quasi-periodic pertubations of the Earth's  magnetic field with periods between
              10 and 45 seconds.  One sources  of these pulsations is believed to be the
              upstream solarwind.  High  latitude magnetic impulse events are large amplitude
              (100nt), often  monopolar pulsations of the geomagnetic field with periods of
              10 -  20 minute duration.  Interest in these pulsations was stimulated by  the
              hypothesis that they consituted the ionospheric signature of  sporatic
              reconnection -- though this speculation has become very  controversial.  Recent
              work suggests that these may occur on closed  field lines.  The possible
              connection between Pc 3 and TCVs has not  been undertaken.  There have,
              however, been some observations to  indicate that Pc 3 events can occur
              simultaneously with TCV events  and propagate with the same horizontal speed. 
              This suggests that  they may occur on the same field lines and share a common
              source.   A detailed study is needed to develop a conclusive determination of 
              a possible relationship between the two phenomena.  This will be  accomplished
              using data from the MACCS magnetometer array in  northern Canada.
