Abstract    :
              Srinivasan  9623141    This proposal supports the work of Professor H.
              Srinivasan to  work on problems in commutative algebra.  She intends to study 
              the multiplicity of R/I for a homogeneous ideal I in terms of the  shifts in
              its minimal graded resolution.  She also intends to  study the finite
              determinations of the presentations of an ideal.  Finally, she intends to
              construct the minimal algebra resolutions  for R/I where I is an ideal in the
              linkage class of a complete  resolution.     This research is on the boundary
              between commutative algebra and  algebraic geometry.  Both fields arose from
              the classical problem  of studying mathematical objects defined in the plane by
              the  simplest of equations, namely polynomials.  Today, the fields use  methods
              not only from algebra, but also from analysis and  topology, and conversely are
              extensively used in those fields.   Moreover it has proved itself useful in
              fields as diverse as  physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography,
              coding  theory and robotics.
