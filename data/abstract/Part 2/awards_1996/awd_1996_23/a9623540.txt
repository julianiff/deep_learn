Abstract    :
              9623540  BRODIE   Phenotypic plasticity describes the process by which a single
              genotype may produce different phenotypes, depending on the environment
              experienced.  The primary goal of this project is to identify and quantify the
              genetic and environmental factors that influence phenotypic plasticity. 
              Specifically, this research will answer the following pivotal questions: (1)
              What are the relative roles of genes versus the environment in the plastic
              expression of traits?  (2) How much do parental behaviors influence phenotypic
              plasticity in their offspring? (3)  Does phenotypic plasticity impose costs
              through tradeoffs with other important traits?   These questions will be
              addressed using the Asian ladybird beetle, Harmonia axyridis.  This beetle is
              an excellent candidate for quantitative genetic studies and is ecologically and
              agriculturally important as a predator of several crop pests.  Before H.
              axyridis can be used as a viable agricultural tool against crop pests, however,
              more information is needed  on how it responds to variation in the environment.
               This research directly addresses that gap by determining the genetic,
              environmental and evolutionary factors that define the success or failure of
              newly colonizing populations of H. axyridis.
