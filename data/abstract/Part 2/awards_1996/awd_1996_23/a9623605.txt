Abstract    :
              Meller  9623605   This Career Award project presents a research and education
              plan driven by the integration of production system operations and facility
              layout decisions. The objective is the development of an integrated layout
              model that can be used to evaluate how changes in production system operations
              impact the facility layout. Features include the ability to highlight when
              changes to a layout will be economically feasible from a production operations
              perspective.    Impacts of the project include an improved research model for
              facility layout decisions, new case-studies and educational algorithms for
              instructional purposes, and engineering internships for graduate students.
              Project objectives are pursued with substantial industrial interaction and
              support.
