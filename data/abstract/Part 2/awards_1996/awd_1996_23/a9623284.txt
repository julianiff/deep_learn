Abstract    :
              9623284  Meakin  This grant supports the research of Professors Meakin,
              Margolis,  Sapir and Birget to work on a series of problems in the  algorithmic
              and computational theory of groups and semigroups.  The first area is the
              relationship between Dehn functions of  groups and semigroups and the
              computational complexity of the  associated word problem. The next goal is to
              study further the  properties of diagram groups associated with semigroup 
              presentations.  The third area is that of rewriting systems for  various
              classes of groups and semigroups.  The fourth area is  extension problems for
              automata.  The final area is the study of  various algorithmic problems in the
              theory of group varieties.   This is research in the field of group and
              semigroup theory.  These areas can be thought of as the study of symmetry in
              the  abstract.  As such, this area has direct applications to many  areas of
              physics and chemistry.  Moreover, within the last 30  years, many connections
              to problems in data transmission have  been solved using techniques from group
              theory.  There are also  direct connections to the error correcting codes that
              are vital  for modern computing such as working with CD-ROM's as well as to 
              theoretical computer science in general.
