Abstract    :
              9623718  Baker  By using diblock copolymers that can be selectively tailored  to
              produce different packing densities on a surface, a wide  regime of geometries
              can be prepared in good and poor  solvents.  The molecular details of these
              more realistic and  useful sheared systems will be examined, paying particular 
              attention to equilibrium geometries before and after  subjecting them to shear
              stresses.  %%%  The teaching methods proposed are for an upper-level surface 
              spectroscopy class to combine a more traditional lecture  course with
              hypermedia techniques and interactive teaching  styles with laboratory
              experiences.  ***
