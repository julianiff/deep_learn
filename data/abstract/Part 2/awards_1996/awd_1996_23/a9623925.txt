Abstract    :
              9623925  Wyatt   Most flowering plants are hermaphroditic, producing both male
              and female reproductive organs.  Consequently, self-pollination as well as
              cross-pollination is possible.  Self-pollinated flowers often are less likely
              to set seed than cross-pollinated flowers. Mechanisms responsible for the loss
              of seed production include the action of genetic self-incompatibility systems
              and the effects of early-acting inbreeding depression.  Distinguishing between
              these two causes of sterility is challenging, especially for species that
              exhibit either late-acting self-incompatibility or post- pollination selection
              of outcrossed offspring over selfed ones. The research funded by this award
              resolves these different mechanisms in two species of milkweeds (Asclepias),
              using experimental crosses.  First, experiments will test whether self
              sterility results from either the abortion of selfed embryos due to
              early-acting inbreeding depression or the rejection of selfed zygotes based on
              late-acting self-incompatibility. If late-acting self-incompatibility is
              implicated, its genetic basis will be determined.  Second, the role of 
              post-pollination selection in causing non random mating in a self-fertile
              milkweed will be resolved.    These studies will help to clarify the importance
              of inbreeding depression and self-incompatibility in mating system evolution. 
              Because inbreeding depression is a problem in both applied agricultural systems
              and endangered plant populations, understanding mechanisms that alleviate
              inbreeding can inform efforts for crop improvement and native plant
              conservation.
