Abstract    :
              The State University of New York (SUNY) is a very large public 
              college/university system which proposes to develop a SUNY alliance  for
              minority participation.  The four SUNY institutions that offer  engineering
              programs are taking the lead on the proposed  initiative.  The four
              institutions are Buffalo, Binghamton, New  Paltz, and Stony Brook.  While these
              institutions offer the  engineering programs in the SUNY system, the
              disciplines involved  in the proposed initiative will also include applied
              science,  mathematics, physical sciences, and biological sciences.    A variety
              of successful minority programs already exist throughout  the SUNY system.  The
              proposed SUNY-AMP proposes to provide  alliances among these programs and
              establish new programs to meet  the specified goals of the proposal.  In
              particular, it is expected  that the number of minorities receiving bachelor
              degrees will  increase twofold from 241 underrepresented minority SMET
              graduates  to 480 by the year 2000.  Likewise, the expected increase in the 
              master's degrees will be from 27 to 60; in the case of Ph.Ds the  number of
              degrees will increase from 4 to 24.    Central to this proposal are four stated
              goals:  (1) Increase the  number of minority students that are accepted into
              the coalition of  SUNY schools; (2) Help minority students excel rather than
              merely  avoid failure; (3) Expand research opportunities for minority 
              students; and (4) Double the number of SMET bachelor degrees  awarded by
              underrepresented minority students.    In part, the alliance can be seen as a
              coalition of four different  regional alliances each centered around the four
              institutions  mentioned above.
