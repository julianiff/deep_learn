Abstract    :
              9623496  Crawford   Graduate student Karla Gengler, with direction from adviser
              Daniel Crawford at Ohio State University, is studying the South American plant
              family Malesherbiaceae, with an emphasis on obtaining new DNA sequence data
              from all the species in the family in order to infer phylogenetic
              relationships.  This small family is endemic to the Pacific coastal desert
              region of South America, and occurs in two areas separated by the Atacama
              Desert in northern Chile.  It will serve as a starting point for the study of
              biogeography and speciation patterns of aridland plants and animals of this
              region.  The current taxonomic classification is based on morphological
              characters, most of which have not been evaluated for variability and
              reliability.  Re-evaluation of these and addition of new molecular evidence
              from nuclear ribosomal gene sequencing will provide data for robust inferences
              of phylogenetic (genealogical) relationship among the species and with related
              groups.  Field work in Peru will augment collections already made in Chile and
              those from herbarium holdings.  In turn, the phylogeny will provide a necessary
              background for studies of biogeography (migration routes, centers of origin and
              of diversification) and of speciation patterns.  %%%   The Pacific coastal
              desert of South America contains a variety of arid habitats that are presumed
              to have developed since the Paleocene as the Andes mountains rose and the cold
              Humboldt Current formed to the west.  Pleistocene glaciations are thought to
              have further affected plant distributions in this region.  In order to
              establish patterns of plant species movements through time, robust phylogenies
              of many groups must be established.  This project promises one of these, for
              the small family Malesher`iaceae.  ***
