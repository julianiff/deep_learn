Abstract    :
              9623227  DOYLE  The tuber crop Oxalis tuberosa, or  "oca", was domesticated in
              the Andes region of South America long before Inca times.  It has the potential
              for widespread cultivation, but unlike the potato, another Andean native, oca
              is still little known in the rest of the world.  Oca is among the many crops,
              such as potatoes, maize and wheat, that are polyploid, in this case with eight
              sets of chromosomes (most plants and animals have two sets).  The origins of
              oca can be more accurately evaluated by identifying its closest relatives among
               wild species of Oxalis, and by determining the origin of its eight sets of
              chromosomes.  The extra chromosome sets may have arisen during domestication,
              either by duplication of those present in a single progenitor species or by
              hybridization among two or more progenitors.    In this study, Eve Emshwiller,
              under the direction of Jeffrey Doyle, will use evidence from DNA sequences,
              chromosome number, and the form and anatomy of the plants to determine the
              phylogenetic relationships among oca and its wild relatives.  In particular,
              the researchers will determine if wild tuber-bearing Oxalis species, recently
              discovered in Bolivia, represent the progenitor(s) of oca.   Knowledge of the
              distribution of genetic diversity in cultivated oca and its relatives will shed
              light on the geographic origins and history of domestication.  The results of
              the study will provide information crucial for efforts to conserve the
              biodiversity of the crop and its wild relatives, and will inform a related
              ethnobotanical study that is investigating human influences on the genetic
              variability of the crop.
