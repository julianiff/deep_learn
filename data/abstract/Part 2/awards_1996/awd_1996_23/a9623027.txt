Abstract    :
              This grant supports the work of Professor Y. Zarhin to work in  arithmetic
              geometry specifically problems in l-adic cohomology.  He will study how the
              weights of an l-adic representation can  restrict the Lie algebra
              representations arising from Galois  actions on Abelian varieties. He will also
              study the eigenvalues  of the Frobenius action on Abelian varieties over finite
              fields.  He also intends to study complex Abelian varieties where the rank  of
              the Hodge group is close to the dimension.      This project falls into the
              general area of arithmetic geometry  -a subject that blends two of the oldest
              areas of mathematics:  number theory and geometry. This combination has proved 
              extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that  withstood
              generations.  Among its many consequences are new error  correcting codes. 
              Such codes are essential for both modern  computers (hard disks) and compact
              disks.
