Abstract    :
              9623439  Duncan    A variety of problems of stochastic adaptive control will be
              investigated in   this project.  Stochastic adaptive control is the control of
              an incompletely   known stochastic system.  Typically to solve an adaptive
              control problem it   is necessary to identify the unknown parameters of the
              system and   simultaneously to construct a control based on an ergodic cost
              functional.    The stochastic systems to be considered include finite
              dimensional, linear   and nonlinear systems and infinite dimensional systems
              that include both   linear and semilinear partial differential equations.  The
              control for the   partial differential equations can occur only on the boundary
              or at discrete   points.  Some specific systems include stochastic models in
              the mathematics   of finance and in stochastic manufacturing processes.  Since
              self-optimal   adaptive controls often cannot be determined or may not exist,
              the   construction of almost optimal adaptive controls will be continued.  An  
              important component of this study is the computational investigations in  
              adaptive control which includes the performance of estimation algorithms   and
              adaptive controls.    Many important physical systems are controlled. 
              Typically a system is not   completely known and often there are perturbations
              or errors that can be   naturally modeled by noise.  The control of an unknown
              system with noise   is called stochastic adaptive control.  This project will
              investigate some   stochastic adaptive control problems that have applications
              to some   important physical systems.  The investigation includes both
              theoretical and   computational aspects.
