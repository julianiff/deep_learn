Abstract    :
              9623818  Jacobsen     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              will refine the CVD processing window for beaded fiber, and develop the window
              for crenulation free fiber.  The resulting products will be used to fabricate
              various composites, which will then be tested relative to their normal
              crenulated fiber counterparts. Crenulation-free fiber is expected to impart
              improved and more reliable thermal and electrical transport properties to its
              composites.   The beaded morphology is expected to give composites improved
              mechanical reinforcement, with reduced crack propagation, and greater
              flexibility in matrix choice due to its ability to physically interlock, rather
              than chemically bond, with a matrix. This research effort seeks to define
              manufacturing process variables for the control of vapor-grown carbon fiber
              (VGCF) morphology.  Previous efforts demonstrated that the properties of
              individual fibers depend on the degree to which they exhibit a morphological
              feature called crenulation.  Further, it has been shown that the severity of
              crenulation can be increased by certain modifications in the manufacturing
              process.  In the extreme, mild crenulations give way to a novel morphology with
              well-defined beads, scattered along the fiber's length.   The VGCF morphologies
              under development would mechanically reinforce composites, and provide improved
              thermal and electrical properties.  Such composites would be employed in the
              automotive and aerospace industries, where their low densities give them a very
              high weight adjusted figure of merit.  They would also be used in the
              electronics industry.  The fiber is also being studied specifically for use in
              low-friction bearings, and as a reinforcement to tire rubber.
