              Infrastructure:  Modeling Complex Physical and Computational Environment       
              This award is for the creation of a Modeling and Simulation Support Facility,
              constituting vital infrastructure for work on end user applications in novel
              computer architectures, manufacturing and design, process control,
              teleoperations, and medicine; while also serving as a testbed for innovations
              in machine architecture, hardware, and software systems.  The Modeling Facility
              will use state-of-the-art technology to achieve high-bandwidth, low-latency
              machine-to-machine communications, resulting in significant computational
              leverage.  The use of multiple heterogeneous and potentially specialized
              computers in a tightly coupled communication environment permits model builders
              to explore novel parallel simulation methods that can greatly reduce simulation
              run times.  This increase in capability permits entirely new classes of
              critical problems to be solved.  Modern simulations produce large quantities of
              data, the interpretation of which may not be immediately apparent.  Thus, the
              second central component of the Modeling Facility is a large capacity storage
              management system.  Finally, the Modeling Facility will be equipped with
              several special purpose devices that can exploit the communications and data
              management facilities to tackle large-scale problems that are currently
              infeasible in a traditional academic computing environment.
