Abstract    :
              9623142  SALINAS         Professor Norberto Salinas proposes  to investigate
              systems  of operators and certain types of operator algebras, such as  Toeplitz
              C*-algebras over pseudoconvex domains with transverse  symmetries, using
              techniques from non-commutative differential  geometry and from the theory of
              functions of several complex  variables. He also plans to use techniques from
              algebraic topology  (more specifically from K-theory) and from non-commutative
              harmonic   analysis.  The ultimate goal of the project is a deep understanding 
              of the joint behavior of n-tuples of operators on Hilbert space.   The focus of
              the research will be on the spectral and c*-  algebraic properties of such
              n-tuples.         The field of multivariable operator theory has become very 
              active in the last ten years. It is central to many mathematical  applications
              to physics, chemistry, biology, economics, computer  sciences, business, and
              engineering.  While Professor Norberto  Salinas does not plan to develop these
              applications, the potential  for these developments are apparent from the type
              of technology  developed in his project.
