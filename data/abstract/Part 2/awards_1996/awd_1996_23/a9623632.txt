               CISE Research Infrastructure: MIDSHIP:  Managing Image Data for Scalable High
              Performance        This award is for the acquisition of a cluster of
              shared-memory processors (SMPs) to support the MIDSHIP project of research into
              enabling technologies for large-scale mining of image data sets.  The equipment
              will help researchers at the University of Wisconsin to perform research: (1)
              on the application side:  medical image mining using mathematical programming
              techniques, machine learning techniques applied to image understanding, view
              synthesis and visual exploration, and querying by image content; and (2) on the
              systems infrastructure side:  parallel hardware and software systems,
              performance tools for profiling parallel systems performance and analyzing
              workload requirements, image storage and compression, and parallel image
              database management technology.  It will also support a wide variety of
              research projects in such diverse fields as Biological Science, Geology,
              Materials Science, Medicine, and Space Science.
