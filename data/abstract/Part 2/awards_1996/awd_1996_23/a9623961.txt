              Glyde    This  is  a joint experimental and theoretical research  program, 
              focusing  on  the  elementary excitations  of  liquid  helium  in  disordered
              environments and confined geometries. The  aim  is  to  investigate  the 
              effect  of  disorder  and  confinement  on  the  fundamental  physics of
              quantum fluids, with particular  emphasis  on  superfluidity, Bose-Einstein
              condensation and disorder-driven  localization. The experimental part consists
              of precision neutron  scattering  measurements on liquid helium in Vycor,
              aerogels  and  xerogels.  The  theoretical  part, in  parallel,  will 
              determine  accurate   path-integral  Monte-Carlo  simulations  of  realistic 
              models of disordered liquid helium.  %%%  This  is  a joint experimental and
              theoretical research  program,  devoted   to   the   study  of  quantum  fluids
                in   disordered  environments. The goal is to gain understanding of the
              effect  of  disorder  on microscopic physical phenomena relevant to materials 
              science and technology. To this aim, the simplest quantum  fluid,  namely 
              liquid  helium,  will be investigated  experimentally  in  disordered  systems
              such as Vycor, by means of precision  neutron  scattering  measurements; in
              parallel, state-of-the art  computer  simulations on realistic models will be
              carried out.  ***
