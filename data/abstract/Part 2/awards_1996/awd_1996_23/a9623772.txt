Abstract    :
              9623772  Gross   Environments differ in both the level and spatial scale of
              heterogeneity in resources.  Plants can respond to this variation either by
              individually buffering environmental changes without decreasing their
              reproductive success or by avoiding exposure to the negative portion of
              environmental variation through seed dispersal.  If an individual cannot buffer
              or avoid deleterious environmental change then its performance will decline. 
              Research funded by this award will address whether genetic variation exists
              within plant populations for either buffering capacity or avoidance of
              environmental heterogeneity.  The native grass, Danthonia spicata, will be used
              as a model system.  Field experiments will assess the magnitude and scale of
              environmental variation experienced by several grass genotypes and a greenhouse
              study will test whether the same genotypes vary in their ability to buffer
              variation in one key growth resource, soil nitrogen.  Fitness consequences of
              differences among individuals in buffering capacity will be tested.
              Understanding the ability of species to respond to environmental variation
              through joint response of multiple traits should be helpful in predicting how
              native plant populations will cope with  environmental degradation.
