Abstract    :
              9623054  Uribe    The proposed research lies in the general area of mathematical
              physics. More specifically, the investigator intends to study the relationship
              between the reduction procedure in classical mechanics and the corresponding
              operation in quantum mechanics, namely the restriction of the associated
              Hilbert space to the space of vectors invariant under the symmetries. The
              geometry of eigenfunctions of a Schrodinger-type operator on a compact
              Riemannian manifold will also be studied, in the semi-classical limit.    The
              proposed work stems from various mathematical difficulties coming out of
              quantum mechanics; lies in the interface between modern analysis and geometry.
              Quantum mechanics, although makes more accurate predictions than classical
              mechanics, is perceived to be riddled with certain foundational as well as
              technical difficulties by some workers in the field, not the least among these
              difficulties are the very difficult mathematics involved.
