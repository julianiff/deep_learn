Abstract    :
              9623683  Donoghue   Graduate student Diane Ferguson, with direction from adviser
              Michael Donoghue at Harvard University, is studying the plant family
              Hydrophyllaceae, with emphasis on new molecular evidence for inferring
              phylogenetic relationships.  Hydrophyllaceae are a diverse group of herbs and
              shrubs that have radiated in an evolutionary sense in western North America,
              especially California where 13 of the 17 genera and ca. 130 species occur. 
              Given that most genera of Hydrophyllaceae are localized in distribution yet are
              variable and species-rich within this range, they present an opportunity for
              intensive study of phylogeny, species diversification, and character evolution.
               The goals of the project include: (1) to infer the phylogeny (genealogy) of
              representative taxa within the family and among related groups by using
              mutational differences measured from DNA sequences of the chloroplast gene
              ndhF; (2) to assess the variability and reliability of morphological characters
              used in traditional classifications of this family; and (3) to begin analyses
              of character evolution (direction and degree), biogeography, and shifts in
              diversification rates within this phylogenetic framework.   %%%   The plant
              family Hydrophyllaceae includes herbaceous and woody members, with an array of
              floral and fruit characteristics, mostly concentrated in western North America.
               Phylogenetic analyses of this group will determine relationships between
              herbaceous and woody species, test whether transitions have occurred singly or
              many times, and whether other vegetative or reproductive features correlate
              with these growth-form transitions and with presumed species migrations between
              tropical and temperate ranges.  New molecular data from DNA sequencing will
              provide robust evidence for these phylogenetic appraisals.  ***
