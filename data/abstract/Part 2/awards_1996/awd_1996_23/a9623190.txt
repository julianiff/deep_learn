Abstract    :
              9623190 Dynkin  ABSTRACT   Investigations on branching measure-valued processes
              and their connections with nonlinear PDEs are proposed. One of the targets is
              the boundary theory of superdiffusion on a differentiable manifold  and related
              problems on the equation Lu=F(u) where L is the second order elliptic
              differential operator and F is a nonlinear function. Among the problems are the
              description of all positive solutions and their behavior at the Martin
              boundary, and criteria for removable boundary singularities in terms of the
              Martin capacity.  This part of the project has been prepared for by an
              intensive study, done in the last years,  of the case of a bounded domain with
              a smooth boundary in a Euclidean space. Another direction iq the investigation
              of the structure of the most general branching measure-valued process. Previous
              results have been obtained under an assumption that the second moment of the
              total mass is finite. There is a hope to remove or to weaken this restriction
              by using recent progress in the theory of linear additive functionals.  During
              the last decade branching measure-valued processes  also known as
              superprocesses  have attracted a great deal of effort from many investigators
              around the world.  Interest in these processes is motivated by their
              applications to biology, especially, to population genetics. On the other hand,
              this class of processes provides new tools for the study of complex physical
              systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom.
