Abstract    :
              SCHLESINGER   DEB-9623837  The goal of this research is to determine how
              cultivation history affects plant colonization and competition  in forest
              patches .  We hypothesize that at the local scale repeated slash-and-burn
              agriculture will reduce the availability of limiting soil nutrients, such as
              phosphorous, for plant growth.  At the landscape scale, changes in the spatial
              and temporal distribution of seed sources over the course of many
              slash-and-burn cycles will affect which species arrive at a given patch.  Both
              observational studies and experimentation in lab and field will be used to test
              these hypotheses.    The conversion of primary forest to agricultural land is
              vital to the well-being of millions of rural poor in the tropics.  It is also
              the sources of biodiversity loss and loss of carbon storage potential. 
              Sustainable management and development of these landscapes depends on
              understanding the relationship between diversity and nutrient cycling and how
              it is affected by repeated disturbance.
