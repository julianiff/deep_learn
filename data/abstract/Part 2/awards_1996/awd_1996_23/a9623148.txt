Abstract    :
              9623148  Morin    Food chain theories linking trophic structure (number and
              composition of trophic levels) to productivity are important to understanding
              the regulatory roles of these factors in ecological systems.  Tests of these
              theories also provide insight into the mechanisms of nutrient effects in
              natural and enriched ecosystems.  In this study, productivity and number of
              trophic levels in the food chain will be experimentally manipulated in
              microcosms containing protists and bacteria.  One set of experiments will test
              predictions of a food chain model by assembling linear, homogeneous food chains
              of one, two, and three trophic levels and monitoring biomass within each
              trophic level over a range of productivity generated by different nutrient
              conditions.  A second set of experiments will test the impact of added
              heterogeneity (multiple species or types of species per trophic level) on
              trophic levels one and two.  These experiments will also test predictions
              concerning conditions under which increased productivity causes an increase in
              the abundance or biomass of species in the top trophic level.    Adequate tests
              of food chain theories are lacking, largely due to the difficulty of
              manipulating productivity over a range sufficient to alter number of trophic
              levels.  The experimental microcosms that will be used in this study provide a
              unique opportunity to test food chain theory experimentally.
