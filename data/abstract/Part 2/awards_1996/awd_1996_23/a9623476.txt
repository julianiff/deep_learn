Abstract    :
              9623476  JANSEN  This award will provide funds for materials and supplies as
              well as travel funds for obtaining material from Malaysia and the western
              Pacific and some DNA sequencing effort in the laboratory of Dr. Mark Chase at
              Kew Gardens, UK.   This support will enhance the dissertation of Douglas H.
              Goldman who is a graduate student with Dr. Robert Jansen at University of
              Texas, Austin.  The student's dissertation project has two elements 1) revision
              of the North American orchid genus Calopogon, utilizing molecular and
              morphological data sets and including population level analyses across the
              geographic range of species, especially to assess the status of the species C.
              oklahomensis, which is believed to be of hybrid origin and 2) molecular
              phylogenetic analysis of the tribe Arethuseae to which Calopogon belongs and
              which is a basal lineage critical to understanding relationships in the family
              Orchidaceae.   This award will provide support for a graduate student pursuing
              studies of relationships in the orchid plant family.  These plants are
              world-wide in distribution but many have restricted habitats and are threatened
              or endangered.  Some are of major economic importance as nursery cultivars but
              their very beauty and popularity has threatened other rare species.  Support
              for the training of graduate students in modern systematic and population
              biology methodologies is important for maintaining the workforce of scientists
              capable of addressing the questions and issues of biodiversity which are of
              increasing global concern.
