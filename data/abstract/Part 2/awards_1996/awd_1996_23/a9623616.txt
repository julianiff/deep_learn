Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will help the  Department of Chemistry at  University of North Carolina at
              Chapel Hill acquire a modern 500  MHz NMR spectrometer and upgrade an existing
              Varian XL-400 MHz and a Bruker MSL-  300WB NMR Spectrometer. This equipment
              will enhance research in a number of areas  including the following: transition
              metal catalyst olefin polymerization; total synthesis of  complex natural
              products; polymerizations in supercritical fluids; engineering of non-genetic 
              proteins; development of 2D pulsed field gradient NMR experiments,
              relationships between  protein structure, stability and function; structure and
              design of ferroelectric liquid crystals;  synthesis and application of
              phosphorous-capped metal clusters; and enantioselective reactions  of metal
              complexes.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool available to  chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
              molecules. It is used to identify unknown  substances, characterize specific
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR 
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
              The results from  these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers,
              catalysis, and in biology.
