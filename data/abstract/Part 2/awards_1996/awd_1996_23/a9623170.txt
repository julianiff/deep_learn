Abstract    :
              Abstract      9623170  Coakley     Funds are requested to cover the costs of
              gravity and bathymetry data acquisition in the Arctic Ocean for a study of the
              Arctic Mid Ocean Ridge (AMOR) and the adjacent sliver of continental crust, the
              Lomonosov Ridge.  In concert with the physical oceanographic program, we would
              like to collect additional long bathymetric and gravity anomaly profiles across
              the combined Lomonosov Ridge and AMOR.  This data, combined with the collected
              on previous submarine science cruises, will permit the construction of regional
              scale maps across much of the basin within the operational area.   The advance
              of plate tectonics into the Arctic Ocean basin has reached only to the
              Lomonosov Ridge.  The Arctic Mid Ocean Ridge is the northern extension of the
              Mid Atlantic Ridge.  It is perhaps the slowest spreading ridge on earth. 
              Propagation of the AMOR into the Arctic Ocean separated the Lomonosov Ridge
              from the northern edge of Eurasia beginning at about 58Ma.  This separation has
              continued up until the present time.   Maps produced during this study will be
              used to define transverse structures in the ridge (the geometry of half graben
              bounding faults and transfer zones) and the morphology of the AMOR.  The
              regional lines will also be useful for studies of isostatic compensation of
              both the Lomonosov Ridge and the AMOR as well as defining he transition from
              the Lomonosov Ridge to the adjacent enigmatic Alpha-Mendeleev Ridge.
