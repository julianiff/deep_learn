Abstract    :
              Goodman  96-23136    This grant supports the research of Professor A Goodman to
              work on problems in the asymptotic behavior of permutation actions on finite
              groups. For example he hopes to determine asymptotic formulas for the size of
              solvable subgroups of a finite group G in terms of the number of points on
              which the group can act faithfully and transitively. He also hopes to determine
              an asymptotic formula for the number of abelian subgroups needed to generate a
              group.     This is research that crosses the boundary between group theory and
              combinatorics. These areas can be thought of as the study of symmetry in the
              abstract. As such, this area has direct applications to many areas of physics
              and chemistry. Moreover, within the last 30 years, many connections to problems
              in data transmission have been solved using techniques from group theory and
              combinatorics. There are also direct connections to the error correcting codes
              that are vital for modern computing such as working with CD-ROM's as well as to
              theoretical computer science in general.
