Abstract    :
              Abstract  Lapidus    Lapidus will study the vibrations of "fractal drums," both
              "drums with fractal boundary" and "drums with fractal membrane."  More
              specifically, he will develop analysis on fractals and on regions with fractal
              boundary, as well as investigate and use new connections with Connes'
              noncommutative geometry and the associated "quantized calculus."  The long term
              objective is gain a better understanding of the fine geometric structure of
              fractals by combining the traditional tools from harmonic analysis, probability
              theory, dynamical systems, and PDEs with methods from noncommutative geometry. 
                This project has many potential physical and engineering applications,
              including transport in porous media and percolation networks, fractal
              resonators such as microwave cavities, phase transitions, and diffusions on
              fractally structured media.  Further, it is directly relevant to current
              technology, such as oil recovery, computer microchips, radar imaging, and very
              efficient heat insulators called "aerogels."
