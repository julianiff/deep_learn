Abstract    :
              9623838  Riley    A central assumption in the study of how mutation affects
              organisms is that the majority of mutations are harmful. This asqumption has
              never been experimentally tested.  The goal of the research funded by this
              award is to test this assumption by determining the fate of novel genetic
              variation.  Despite our current knowledge of the molecular biological processes
              which create mutation, little information is known about how or how much of the
              introduced variation is maintained in nature once a trait produced by the
              mutation is subjected to natural selection.   To address this issue, Wagner and
              Riley will assess the effects of many different mutations on the viability and
              growth of bacteria, which are organisms that allow testing the effects of many
              kinds of mutations in a short period of time.  A technique called random
              mutagenesis will be used to create many different mutated copies of a single
              gene in a bacterium, and the fraction of mutations that are beneficial,
              harmful, or have no effect will be determined.  The exact chemical nature of
              the mutations from each of these three classes will be probed, to reveal
              whether there are particular types of mutations that are associated with
              benefit or harm to the organism.  Using this information, it may then be
              possible for biologists to incorporate mutations of positive effect into
              beneficial organisms or harmful mutations into pest genotypes. Results may also
              facilitate the engineering of bacteria to perform certain functions, many of
              which may be useful in industrial processes.
