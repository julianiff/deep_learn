Abstract    :
              Abstract  Gursky  9623048        The research to be supported by this grant is
              concerned with the study of fourth order differential equations and systems of
              equations from differential geometry.  The equations under consideration are
              Euler equations for functionals that are connected to certain sharp Sobolev
              inequalities.  The systems of equations arise in differential geometry when
              studying the problem of prescribing curvature and the existence of critical
              points of a functional introduced in relativity.    Historically, the most
              fruitful applications of pure mathematics to very real world problems are often
              the result of the interaction of two different fields within the subject.  The
              work to be supported here attempts to use methods of mathematical analysis to
              study certain problems in the field of differential geometry.  At least one of
              these   problems is relevant to physics, but it is often the case that the
              mathematics precedes the application by many years, so that it is difficult to
              assess the immediate use of the problems posed here: except to say that they
              are very basic questions that hopefully will increase the depth of our
              understanding of a subject that has seen many applications   in the past.
