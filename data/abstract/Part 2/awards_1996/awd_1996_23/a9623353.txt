Abstract    :
              9623353  GRAVES   This award will provide funds for materials and supplies to
              enhance the dissertation research of a graduate student, David B. Carlini,
              working with Dr. John E. Graves at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. 
              The research project of this student involves obtaining DNA sequence data for
              two genes, one nuclear and one mitochondrial, in efforts to determine the
              higher level relationships among cephalopod molluscs in the subclass Coleoidea.
               This fascinating group of marine invertebrates includes squid and their
              relatives.  The group includes many deep sea species that are not readily
              obtainable.  Thus, the group has been relatively neglected and is in need of
              systematic study and a robust classification.  This molecular phylogenetic
              study should provide that classification or hypothesis of relationships, which
              can then serve as a basis for other interesting research studies involving
              biogeography, reproductive strategies, morphological adaptations, etc..   This
              award will provide support for a graduate student pursuing information about
              relationships of squid and their relatives.  Support for the training of
              graduate students in modern systematic methodologies is important for
              maintaining the workforce of scientists capable of addressing the questions and
              issues of biodiversity which are of increasing global concern.  This group of
              marine invertebrates, like many others, is in need of systematic study which
              will provide the background necessary for many other areas of basic research as
              well as informing applied work such as conservation research and bioprospecting
              efforts.
