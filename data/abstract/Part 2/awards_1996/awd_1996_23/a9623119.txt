Abstract    :
              9623119  McInerny   This research planning grant will address the questions of:
              (1) what signal or quantities should be measured, and (2) what signal
              processing methods should be used to detect insulation breakdown in   AC
              induction motors that use pulse width modulation (PWM) control.  While it is a
              powerful speed control method with many commercial applications, PWM control
              causes electrical harmonics when used on old motors or new high efficiency
              motors not designed for adjustable speeds.  These harmonics lead to motor
              losses, torque pulsations, overheating, acoustical noise and mechanical
              vibration, and ultimately the destruction of the electrical insulation and the
              motor.  Dynamic analysis and preliminary experiments indicate that signature
              analysis may be a useful way to track and monitor the condition of these
              systems.  Kalman filtering or spectral techniques, such as wavelets, are
              promising methods.   Because PWM control is common in drive systems and modern
              air handling systems, diagnostic methods to reliably track insulation
              degradation in mechanical equipment will impact both productivity and health in
              factories and offices.  ***
