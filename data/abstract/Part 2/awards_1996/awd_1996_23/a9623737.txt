Abstract    :
              The research objective is to develop methodologies for the design of giga-scale 
              CMOS systems.  A focus is high bit rate digital communications.  The approach 
              transcends boundaries between algorithmic, architectural, logic, circuit and 
              technological aspects of the VLSI design methodology.  The research has two 
              parts.  The first is an investigation of fundamental limits on power area speed
               and reliability in giga-scale computation.  Activities include: (a)
              establishing  non-empirical and achievable bounds on the power dissipation,
              area, speed and  reliability for any given algorithm and implementation
              technology' and (b)  exploring methods to achieve these fundamental bounds.  In
              the second part,  algorithms, architectures, and systems for design of high-bit
              rate communications  systems are being investigated.  Activities include: (a)
              developing power, area,  and speed-optimal VLSI algorithms and architectures
              for high-bit rate digital  communications and signal processing applications;
              and (b) building  communications and signal processing applications; and (b)
              building practical  systems for 155.52 Mb/s transmission over twisted-pair
              wiring for ATM and IMTV,  and wireless spread-spectrum systems.
