                This  research aims at developing a novel system that can be used  to detect
              the motion of individual flux lines in high temperature  superconducting  
              (HTS)  materials  in  magnetic   fields.    The  instrument will be equipped
              with HTS thin film transformers  with  a micrometer-size pickup coil to couple
              the flux motion signal to  a  dc SQUID.  This probe will be scanned with
              micrometer control.  With  this  instrument the dynamics of flux line motion 
              will  be  investigated, especially the depinning process.  An objective  is  to
               determine information about individual pinning sites  in  the  HTS   material.
                This  research  may  reveal  the  main  pinning  mechanism  and  thus may
              lead to an improvement in  the  critical  current density in the HTS materials.
               %%%  The  discovery  of  high  temperature  superconducting  materials 
              provides  great  potential  for applications  in  many  types  of  products. 
              The key problem for many practical applications is the  enhancement  of  the
              critical current density in magnetic  fields  that  is governed by control of
              magnetic flux line motion.   This  grant  supports the development of a
              microscopic probe to  detect  the  motion  of flux lines and determine the
              material  properties  such  as defects or impurities that impede or pin the
              flux lines.  Thus this research may lead to new techniques for the preparation 
              of high-current carrying superconductors.  ***
