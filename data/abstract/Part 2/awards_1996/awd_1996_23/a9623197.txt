Abstract    :
              9623197  LI, W-S      The purpose of this project is to obtain    a better
              understanding of the structure of bounded linear  operators acting on a
              complex, separable, infinite dimensional  Hilbert space. During the past
              sixteen years, the theory of dual algebras   has provided us considerable
              knowledge for the dilation theory   of contraction operators, the invariant
              subspace problem, and the   reflexivity problem. The principal investigator
              plans to continue this  program, focusing now on more general classes of
              operators and dual   algebras generated by more than one operator.  At the same
              time,  the principal investigator will also continue   her research on control
              theory via the commutant   lifting theorem. In addition, she will also continue
              her study of   the class of C-0 operators.        My current work is in
              operator theory, in particular studying the   structure of linear operators on
              Hilbert spaces. These operators   appear in many mathematical models, which are
              used in physics, economy,   engineering, etc.. Therefore, a better
              understanding of these   operators is of fundamental importance since it should
              lead in   improving these models as well as the qualities of the simulations
              and forecasts made out them.
