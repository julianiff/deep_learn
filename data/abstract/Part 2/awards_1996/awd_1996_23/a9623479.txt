Abstract    :
              9623479  Rice   The Dissertation Research funded by this award will test basic
              theory on adaptive evolution.  Natural selection can be divided into two
              components - sexual selection (competition by males to fertilize eggs) and
              non-sexual selection (survival of both sexes and egg production by females). 
              Theory predicts that these two forms of selection can be either reinforcing or
              antagonistic.  If the latter case is common, sexual selection will slow a
              population's adaptation to a changing environment. Research funded by this
              award will establish how these two forms of natural selection interact in
              nature.  To do this, a laboratory population of Drosophila melanogaster  will
              be challenged with a new environmental factor, heat stress.  The rate of
              adaptation by the population to the new environment will then be determined
              with and without sexual selection imposed, providing a direct measure of the
              regime under which adaptation accrues most rapidly.    The relationship between
              sexual selection and non-sexual selection is of practical concern in all
              breeding enterprises involving animals or plants  (e.g. agriculture, zoological
              parks, and conservation biology).  This  research will also shed light on how
              fast can populations adapt to thermally changing environments.  Findings will
              provide practical information for predicting the ability of insect populations
              to respond to a protracted and substantial increase in temperature, as
              anticipated under global climate change.
