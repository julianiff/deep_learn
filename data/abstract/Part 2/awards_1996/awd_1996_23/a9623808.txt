Abstract    :
              9623808  Li    The purpose of this project is to examine several techniques 
              that can be employed in studying micromechanical  deformation.  Included within
              this group are the atomic  force microscope, continuous indentation testing,
              the  impression creep machine, and the scratch tester.  Continuous indentation
              testing experiments are employed as a  new technique to determine the adhesion
              strength between a  deposited thin film and the substrate, as well as measuring
               Young's modulus and PoissonOs ratio of the film itself.  Impression creep
              machine tests of grain boundaries and  triple junctions in zinc are analyzed. 
              Scratch testing of  glass and polymers is performed to understand the
              stick/slip  process.  The atomic force microscope looks at shear bands  in
              amorphous metals (with a magnetic indenter) as well as  micro shear bands and
              crazes in polymers.  Continuous  indentation testing  of amorphous metals on
              the wheel side  and the air side are compared.  Theoretical analysis  involves
              finite element computation, analytical methods,  molecular dynamics and
              modeling of critical steps in all of  the tests.  The studies are aimed at
              answering questions  associated with the employment of these techniques and the
               micromechanical deformation behavior of the selected  materials.  %%%  The
              results should impact techniques used for  micromechanical measurements,
              polishing and grinding of  glasses, and improved adhesion of thin films and
              coatings to  substrates.  ***
