Abstract    :
              Abstract  Witte    The project continues previous work of the PI on three
              related topics: superrigidity, tessellations of homogeneous spaces, and actions
              on the circle.  1) The Margulis Superrigidity Theorem applies to lattices only
              in semisimple groups, but the PI has extended this result to lattices in many
              other Lie groups.  2) The PI intends to continue investigating the structure of
              compact manifolds of the form D\G/H, where G is a simply connected Lie group
              and H and D are closed subgroups, such that D acts properly on G/H.  One goal
              is to add to our understanding of which homogeneous spaes G/H admit such a
              tessellation D\G/H.  3) The PI proved that SL(3,Z) (and other arithmetic groups
              of higher Q-rank) has no interesting continuous actions on the circle or the
              real line.  Attempts to extend this result to arithmetic groups whose Q-rank is
              0 or 1 lead to interesting algebraic questions about arithmetic groups of
              higher R-rank: are they right orderable?  are normal subgroups the only
              conjugation-invariant subsets that are closed under multiplication?    Many
              important materials are crystals.  The atomic structure of such a material is
              very symmetric, and a first step toward understanding it is to study the group
              formed by all the symmetries of the structure.  This project investigates the
              symmetry groups that arise from crystals in mathematical spaces other than the
              3-dimensional universe we live in.  Basic problems are to understand which
              spaces do contain crystals, and when it can happen that crystals in two
              different spaces have the same group of symmetries.
