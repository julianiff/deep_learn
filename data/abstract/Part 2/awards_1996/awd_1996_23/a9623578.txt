Abstract    :
                9623578  Larson    Geographic structuring of a group of South American annual
              fishes which inhabit seasonally wet environments will be analyzed using
              variation in mitochondrial DNA sequences.  Hypotheses that phenotypic variation
              is correlated with molecular genetic variation, and that local adaptation to
              extant environments explains distributional patterns of variation in life
              history traits will be tested.  By studying the distribution of molecular
              genetic variation in a statistically rigorous manner, it will be possible to
              determine whether phenotypic differences among populations reflect historical
              events or current local adaptations.  Research funded by this award should
              improve the understanding of factors responsible for survival in environments
              experiencing rapid, often stochastic fluctuations.  Results will also have
              potentially broad applied significance.  Under normal conditions, temporary
              bodies of water become a breeding ground for mosquitoes; thus killifish, due to
              their unique ability to survive complete desiccation of their habitat, have
              been lauded as the ideal mosquito control agents.  By understanding which
              populations are most likely to succeed in a given habitat, it will be possible
              to maximize the benefits of killifish as successful mosquito control agents.
