Abstract    :
              9623969  Ewel  Nutrient use efficiency in simplified tropical ecosystems.   The
              efficiency with which plants use nutrients is a theme that unites physiological
              processes at many scales - from leaves, to plants, to whole ecosystems. Can
              differences in nutrient use efficiency at the leaf and plant level be scaled up
              to predict nutrient use efficiency at the ecosystem level? Nutrient use
              efficiency will be ilvestigated at different scales in a series of simplified
              tropical ecosystems: tree monocultures, and polycultures of trees and a very
              different life form - large, perennial monocots. Nutrient use efficiency will
              be calculated at the leaf level, as the maximum potential photosynthetic rate
              per unit nutrient content; at the plant level, as total biomass produced
              relative to nutrient uptake; and at the ecosystem level, as biomass production
              relative to nutrient supply. The study will provide an opportunity to compare
              nutrient use efficiency across scales, and across life forms. Understanding
              feedbacks between nutrient use efficiency at the leaf and plant level, and
              ecosystem nutrient use, will provide insight into the functional role of
              biodiversity. It will also provide a powerful tool in enabling restoration of
              degraded lands, and design of land use systems that are effective at nutrient
              conservation.
