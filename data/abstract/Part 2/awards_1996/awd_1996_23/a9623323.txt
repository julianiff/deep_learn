Abstract    :
              9623323  Sinsabaugh  Assessing humic inhibition of microbial processes in
              aquatic systems.  Dissolved organic carbon has long been recognized as being a
              major source of energy in many aquatic ecosystems. However, in most systems the
              DOC is composed of a heterogeneous mixture of both labile and recalcitrant
              substances which have not been very well characterized. Previous studies have
              indicated that a sizable portion of the DOC pool is composed of high molecular
              weight humic/phenolic compounds that are refractory in nature. Some of these
              substances may be utilized directly by microorganisms, while others may require
              enzymatic processing before they can be assimilated. The presence of these
              phenolic compounds may have an important influence on the processing of DOC.
              The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between DOC
              quality and the nature of the microbial community. Preliminary work has shown
              that certain fractions of the DOC pool, namely phenolic compounds, can act to
              both stimulate and inhibit bacterial productivity. Through a series of
              individual experiments it may be possible to elucidate some of the underlying
              mechanisms behind this relationship. The PIs propose to examine several
              parameters which may be linked with bacterial productivity, including
              extracellular enzyme activities, plasmid screenings, and elementary DOC
              characterization. These assays will be conducted in both microcosm and field
              trials.
