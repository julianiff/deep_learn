Abstract    :
              9623799  MITTER   Interactions among contemporary insect species and the plants
              they feed on are strongly influenced by their shared historical relationships,
              suggesting an important role for phylogenies (genealogies of species) in
              explaining patterns of hostplant use.  Recent work on the phylogeny of the huge
              moth family Noctuidae (about 25,000 species), previously poorly understood,
              indicates that a "true cutworm" lineage may exist, which combines approximately
              8,000 species from four traditional subfamilies into a single large subfamily,
              the Noctuinae.  Unlike most other noctuids, Noctuinae typically (though not
              invariably) possess caterpillars that are "cryptic" (inconspicuously colored,
              not easy to observe) and feed on non-woody plants.  Most often, these
              caterpillars have broad food plant preferences, and frequently they are pests. 
                 In this research, doctoral student Andrew Mitchell, under the direction of
              Charles Mitter and Jerome Regier, will use the DNA sequences of two nuclear
              genes  to more critically assess the phylogenetic relationships among the
              insects in the Noctuinae.  Mitchell, Mitter and Regier will analyze Elongation
              Factor-1 alpha (EF-1a) and Dopa Decarboxylase (DDC) DNA sequences from 50
              species, representing all major subgroups (tribes and subtribes) within the
              subfamily, to define the limits of and estimate the relationships among these
              groups.  The phylogeny will then be used to determine when, over the long
              history of the cutworm moth group, species have adopted different geographic
              distributions, modes of feeding and diet preferences.  In particular, the
              studies should help determine whether species that share any of these features
              are closely, or only distantly, related.  Knowledge of this basic biology of
              the cutworm moths may assist efforts to manage pest species.
