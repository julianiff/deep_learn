Abstract    :
              Dr. Timothy Hughbanks, Department of Chemistry, Texas A & M University,   is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program   of the
              Chemistry Division for an investigation of the solution chemistry   of polymers
              and clusters containing metal-metal bonds and of ionic   liquids as media for
              the crystallization of cluster based compounds.   Group 3, 4, and lanthanide
              clusters, which are known to exist in the   solid state, will be extracted into
              solution using an   imidizolium/aluminum trichloride mixture, which is liquid
              at room   temperature.  The solution medium will permit these clusters to be  
              characterized as molecular species and to be manipulated in a more  
              controlled, rational fashion than is possible with purely solid state   phases.
              The project  will initially concentrate on a series of zirconium   based
              systems and will develop these as precursors to extended clusters   and
              polymers. As the project progresses, a systematic investigation will   be
              carried out on the use of ionic liquids as solvents for the   preparation and
              crystallization of a variety of cluster compounds.  This project aims at
              devising a new method of preparing and manipulating   polymers composed of
              metal atoms. While such metal species are known to   exist in the solid state,
              the syntheses are not simple and it is often   impossible to use these cluster
              and polymeric substances as, for example,   starting materials for more complex
              polymers or clusters. A new 'ionic'   solvent system has been devised and this
              will be used to dissolve the   materials from the solid. By obtaining them in
              solution, it will be   possible to both characterize them and utilize them to
              reproducibly form   new, presently unknown materials.
