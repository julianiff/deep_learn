Abstract    :
              959623253  GUO  A plasma is a collection of fast-moving, charged particles. 
              Although  most matters in the universe are of forms of plasmas, the main  goal
              of  the plasma study is to control fusion. When collisions among  particles 
              are ignored, there are many interesting steady states in a  collisionless
              plasma. The proposer studies their dynamical  stability  which has potential
              applications in the plasma control problem.  %%%  A plasma is a collection of
