Abstract    :
              9623088  Hermiller    This grant supports the research of Professor S. Hermiller
              to work on problems in geometric group theory. She will study rewriting systems
              for Artin groups, triangles of groups and small cancellation products of groups
              in the hope of finding normal forms or automatic structures. She will also
              study extensions of the properties of almost convexity and rational growth that
              will be independent of presentation. She also hopes to extend the theory of
              finite derivation type to higher dimensions.     This is research in the field
              of group theory. Group theory can be thought of as the study of symmetry in the
              abstract. As such, this area has direct applications to many areas of physics
              and chemistry. Moreover, within the last 30 years, many connections to problems
              in data transmission have been solved using techniques from group theory. There
              are also direct connections to the error correcting codes that are vital for
              modern computing such as working with CD-ROM's.
