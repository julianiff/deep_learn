                 NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant IBN-9623336:  Mechanisms of food
              recruitment in a stingless bee, Melipona  panamica.      Large Social insect
              colonies require a considerable food  intake, yet usually live in competitive
              environments in  which food sources are widely dispersed.  Faced with these 
              constraints, many highly social insects in the family  Hymenoptera have evolved
              mechanisms to bring additional  nestmates (recruits) to a newly discovered feed
              source.  The  mechanisms employed by stingless bees to communicate food 
              location are diverse and fascinating, yet poorly understood.  Like many ants,
              stingless bees in several genera directly  follow foragers to feed source
              (piloting) or lay scent  trails followed by recruits.  Like honey bees,
              stingless  bees in the genus Melipona may use sounds to communicate the 
              distance to the food source.  Recent data indicate that  Melipona panamica
              foragers can recruit to a specific  distance, direction and canopy level
              without using scent  trails.    Our goal is to understand how these bees
              recruit to a  specific 3 dimensional set of coordinates.  Recruiting  foragers
              perform an intriguing sequence of spinning  movements and pulsed sounds inside
              the nest.  Foragers also  appear to communicate the food source s direction
              outside  the nest and deposit an unidentified pheromone at the food  site for
              local orientation.  The actual mechanisms may offer  a novel solution to the
              problem of communicating food source  location and will increase our
              understanding of complex  mechanisms of communication in insect societies.
