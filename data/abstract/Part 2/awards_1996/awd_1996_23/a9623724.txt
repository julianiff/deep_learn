Abstract    :
              9623724  Lawson       The aim of this project is to carry out basic mathematical
              research  in the emerging discipline of the Lie theory of semigroups and to
              explore  and extend contact of the theory with other disciplines such as
              geometry,  control theory, and notions of causality in physics.  The general
              theory  has provided a new direction and impetus to classical Lie theory by 
              introducing a notion of order or "positivity" to the theory and thereby  opened
              up new contact points and applications to other disciplines.  At  the group
              level, the appropriate objects to be investigated are those  subsemigroups of
              Lie groups that are generated by their one-parameter  subsemigroups.  At the
              Lie algebra level, it is a special class of cones  called Lie wedges.  And at
              the level of homogeneous spaces, it is the  interrelated notions of homogeneous
              causal orders and homogeneous causal  structures.  The theory of these
              corresponding structures is the principal  focus of this investigation.      
              Classical Lie theory has proved itself an extremely versatile and  powerful
              mathematical tool with a host of applications in geometry,  mathematical
              physics, differential equations, and a wide variety of other  disciplines. 
              There has already been a substantial development and  application of Lie theory
              in the new directions with which this project  is concerned, the theory of
              optimal control of systems being an area of  notably successful application,
              and it is anticipated that the program of  research will significantly enhance
              both the theory and its applicability.  ***
