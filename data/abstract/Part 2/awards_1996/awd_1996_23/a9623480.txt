Abstract    :
               9623480  Carl M. Pearcy, Jr.        The purpose of this project is to
              accumulate more knowledge leading to a  better understanding of the structure
              of operators on Hilbert space. In the  past eighteen years much progress has
              been made there by employing the theory  of dual algebras of operators, which
              the principal investigator helped to  establish. During the next two years, he
              plans to conduct research along these  same lines, and to supervise the
              research of three Ph. D. level students who  are writing theses under his
              direction.       Today's scientific technology depends on many sophisticated
              mathematical  concepts, including that of an operator on Hilbert space. The
              principal inves-  tigator and his students are engaged in research concerning
              such operators.  Knouledge gained from the investigations may lead to future
              advances in such  important technological areas as data transmission, seismic
              exploration, sig-  nal processing, and petroleum recovery.
