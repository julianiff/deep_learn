Abstract    :
              9623536  Sullivan    This  project  will  investigate  the  dynamical 
              properties  of frustrated  quench-disordered systems at low  temperatures. 
              These studies  will  focus  on  determining  the  important  low-energy
              collective excitations in  prototypical orientation glasses (orthoand
              para-dihydrogen  and dinitrogen-argon solid mixtures), and the behavior  of 
              quantum quadrupoles in reduced  geometries  -  two  dimensional  arrays and
              surface-melted quantum  latticed  fluids. The  proposed  experiments  involve 
              several  different  NMR  and thermodynamic measurements to determine  the
              nature  of  the  lowfrequency  thermal relaxation and  the effect of lattice 
              geometry on  the ordering of  classical and quantum rotors in orientational
              glasses.  New  experiments will also probe  quantum  exchange  in  multilayers 
              of  dihydrogen and in helium-3 films  physisorbed  on square-lattice 
              substrates  for which  the  combined  effects  of frustration  and disorder are
               predicted to lead to  nuclear  spin glass  phases.  The  project is of
              fundamental character  but  the results may  provide insights into the
              properties of glasses which are  widely employed in technical and commercial
              applications.  %%%  This  project  will  investigate  the  dynamical
