Abstract    :
              9623669  Del Castillo   This research aims to develop effective multivariate
              quality control (QC) methods for advanced semiconductor manufacturing
              processes.  Specifically of concern is the development and implementation of a
              novel multiple-input-multiple-output quality controller for supervisory control
              of semiconductor manufacturing processes based on the idea of optimizing
              adaptive control.  In many of these processes, the quality characteristics of a
              batch or run of silicon wafers are regulated with automatic controllers of the
              proportional-integral-derivative (PID) type, that regulates variables such as
              pressures, flows, temperatures, etc.  The proposed optimizing adaptive quality
              controller (OAQC) provides a recipe of PID set points at each run by the
              on-line estimation and optimization of a nonlinear transfer function model. 
              The OAQC will be developed and tested in close collaboration with Sematech's
              Statistical Methods and Advanced Process Control Group.  The educational
              component of this project is integrated with the proposed research and reflects
              the PI's philosophy on teaching modern QC courses an interdisciplinary field on
              the intersection between applied statistics and control theory.   The research
              and integrated educational plan is well thought out and the industrial
              collaboration excellent.  The PI already has a strong track record and is felt
              to be extremely competent.  The area of research, QC, is of particular
              importance to the semiconductor manufacturing industry.
