Abstract    :
                    The effort proposed here is to examine the particle and wave entry 
              processes involved in the transfer of mass, energy and momentum  across the
              magnetopause to the magnetospheric boundary layer.  The  proposal is explicit
              in defining problems to be examined and in  ways to distinguish among different
              processes thought to be  responsible for boundary layer structure and wave
              energy entry.   Data investigated will be from the ISEE 1 and 2 spacecraft and
              from  the IGS and AFGL ground magnetometer arrays, as well as from solar  wind
              monitors.
