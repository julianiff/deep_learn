Abstract    :
              9623051  Tsygan    This grant supports the research of Professor B. Tsygan to
              work on various problems in the deformation theory of Poisson manifolds. In
              particular he will work on algebraic index theorems, the homological algebra of
              characteristic classes and quantum cohomology and applications of structure
              theorems for deformations to both Riemann-Roch and the Verlinde formulas.    
              This is research that starts out in the field of algebra but moves beyond that
              to touch both geometry and theoretical physics.  The reasons for these
              connections are that algebra can be though of as the study of symmetry in the
              abstract. As such algebra has direct applications to areas of physics and
              chemistry. In particular the modern theory of gauge fields in physics uses this
              area of algebra extensively and this project will study some of these
              connections at length.
