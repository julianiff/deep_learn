Abstract    :
              9623260  W. B. Johnson and G. Pisier    The proposers will investigate problems
              in the  theories of Banach  spaces and operator spaces. The problems to be
              considered involve:   local theories of operator spaces and of spaces of
              measurable functions,   polynomially bounded operators, bounded homomorphisms
              on C* algebras,   infinite dimensional linear and nonlinear geometry of Banach
              spaces.      Banach space theory forms the natural framework for studying 
              geometries which are not Euclidean, while the theory of C* algebras is the 
              standard framework for quantum mechanics. Operator spaces are the  quantization
              (in the sense of quantum mechanics) of Banach spaces.  This  very new theory
              has already (e.g., in work of Junge and Pisier) had an  impact on C* algebras,
              and part of this work involves approaching other  classical problems in C*
              algebras/operator theory through operator spaces.   The nonlinear geometry of
              Banach spaces is also in a neophyte stage, but  work of Bourgain, Gorelik,
              Johnson-Lindenstrauss-Schechtman, and others  suggest that this subject is
              ready to take-off.  There is reason to hope  that the nonlinear theory of
              Banach spaces will have applications in  classical nonlinear analysis
              comparable to the many applications of the  linear theory to classical linear
              analysis.
