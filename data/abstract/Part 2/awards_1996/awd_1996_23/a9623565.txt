Abstract    :
                  9623565  Wray      Animals vary widely in their ability to regenerate
              missing body parts or to reproduce asexually.  Some species, such as annelid
              worms, flatworms, and sea anemones have remarkable powers of regeneration.  For
              example, certain annelid worms are able to regenerate a new functional adult
              body from only a single segment. The primary goal of this study is to
              characterize the involvement of two key developmental genes (engrailed and
              hunchback) in regeneration, asexual budding, and embryonic development in
              several annelid worms.   Key developmental genes, such as homeobox genes, are
              known to play important roles in many aspects of embryo development, such as
              the formation of the anterior/posterior axis, nervous system development, head
              formation, and limb formation.  These genes are also expected to be involved in
              the development of new tissue during processes such as regeneration and asexual
              reproduction.  However, little is currently known about the action of these
              genes during such processes. In the research funded by this award, genes will
              be cloned and their expression studied during all three processes. 
              Characterization of expression patterns during regeneration and budding will
              help elucidate the functions of the genes and show to what extent these genes
              perform the same role in the different processes.  This research will shed new
              light on the genetical basis of developmental processes underlying
              morphological diversification in animals.  Research on the genetical controls
              of developmental processes also can contribute to an understanding of
              developmental abnormalities and their treatment in higher organisms.
