Abstract    :
                    9623454  Patterson        The genetic code is "degenerate," because not
              all changes in  genetic structure are accompanied by changes in the proteins 
              they  produce.   Base-pair substitutions at "silent"  coding  sites  of 
              mitichondrial DNA are known to deviate  from  the  constant  mutation  rates
              predicted  by  population  genetic  theory.  Some researchers hypothesize that
              higher  metabolic  rates  produce higher (and therefore unequal) rates  of  DNA
               mutation.   A little-known family of mammalian insectivores,  the  tenrecs of
              Madagascar and Africa, exhibit a wide  range  of  metabolic rates and is thus
              especially well  suited  for  testing this hypothesis for unequal evolutionary
              rates.  The  evolutionary   relationships  of   the   tenrecs   will   be 
              established  using  independent  morphological  and  genetic  information,
              including nuclear DNA sequences. The  evolution  of  metabolic  rates and their
              effects on mitochondrial  DNA  substitutions  will  be assessed against  this 
              evolutionary  tree,  providing  a powerful empirical test  of  theoretical 
              predictions.
