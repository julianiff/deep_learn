Abstract    :
              9623747  Leicht    A growing number of social movements, government officials,
              and the media have claimed that disadvantaged communities are
              disproportionately exposed to environmental pollution, yet there has been
              little empirical research examining this claim or its importance for social
              stratification.  This research combines data from the U.S. Environmental
              Protection Agency's 1990 Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) with Census data to
              examine the relationship between the racial and economic composition of places
              and toxic air releases from manufacturing.  This project will compare results
              from a nationwide, county-level analysis with census tract level analysis of
              selected communities that have unusually high levels of manufacturing
              pollution.  The project will use Geographic Information Systems technology and
              spatial analysis techniques to model the dispersion of toxic releases in a more
              sophisticated manner than used in most studies of environmental justice and
              stratification. This research will contribute significantly to the sociological
              understanding of how pollution from manufacturing is distributed across social
              groups by (1) shedding light on debates about the appropriate geographic units
              of analysis for environmental justice research; (2) improving estimates of
              levels of toxic air pollution by using GIS technology, and; (3) exploiting the
              spatial nature of geographic data by testing observed relationships for the
              presence of spatial autocorrelation.  ****
