Abstract    :
              9623181  Sachdev  The primary objective in this grant is to undertake a 
              systematic theoretical study of the finite temperate  properties of quantum
              spin systems.  The project brings  together a wide variety of problems from
              apparently diverse  systems.  For example the cuprate compounds, also known as 
              high Tc superconductors, at low doping levels manifest  complicated interplay
              between antiferromagnetic fluctuations  and quenched disorder.  NMR in Quantum
              Hall effect systems  shows novel spin correlations.  Apart from these principal
               examples, there are properties of rare earth intermetallics  where the
              magnetic ground states are critically influenced  by disorder or competing
              energy scales.  Finally there are  anisotropic materials where spin exchange
              and conduction  occur primarily along one direction.  All of this work will  be
              carried out in the framework of a quantum field theory,  derived from a
              continuum description of the spins.  %%%  The storm generated by the discovery
              of  high Tc  superconductivity led, rather early, to the solution of an  old
              problem, that of quantum antiferromagnets.  The PI was  responsible for some of
              the major developments and is now  proposing to extend that work to a variety
              of other  problems, specifically involving finite temperature effects.  The
              applications are in lightly doped compounds (which show  how magnetism is
              destroyed by doping) and their temperature  dependent properties.  ***
